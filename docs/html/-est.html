      <h1>-est</h1>
      <div>-est is a suffix which is used to describe the superlative of an adjective. Terms such as fastest and strongest mean the most fast and the most strong for whatever they are describing. Even objective adjectives, such as colors, can have -est applied (such as greenest) to apply a sense of potency. Informally, -est can be applied to adjectives that already are superlatives, such as worst into worstest, despite being grammatically incorrect.</div>
