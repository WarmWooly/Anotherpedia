  <h1>-est</h1>
  <div><<shortSuffix for the best of somethingshort>><<img(src=git/-est.png(cap=The [[speed of light]] is the fast{{iest}} anything can go.img>>{{b-est}} is a [[suffix]] which is used to describe the [[superlative]] of an [[adjective]]. Terms such as fastest and strongest mean the most fast and the most strong for whatever they are describing. Even objective adjectives, such as [[colors|color]], can have -est applied (such as greenest) to apply a sense of [[potency]]. Informally, -est can be applied to adjectives that already are superlatives, such as [[worst]] into worstest, despite being grammatically incorrect.</div>
