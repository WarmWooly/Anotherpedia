      <h1>10 (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>10 is a rank of playing cards in Balatro that is worth 10 Chips when played without Modifiers or Jokers. 10s are considered to be a numbered card. The Abandoned Deck removes all face cards, so 10 is more likely to be drawn. The Erratic Deck randomly selects ranks, so 10 may be more or less likely depending on the selected ranks. The following are Jokers that 10 can trigger because of its rank:<<tableJoker|Effect||Even Steven|+4 Mult||Walkie Talkie|+10 Chips and +4 Multtable>>&spMail-In Rebate allows the player to earn $5 on discard with the rank randomly selected at the start of the round, including 10. The Idol gives x2 Mult when a card of a randomly selected rank and suit is played, including 10s of any suit.
There are various methods to obtain cards with the rank 10, including:;;Standard Packs|Cards bought in the Shop with the Voucher Magic Trick|The Tarot Card Strength used on 9s|The Spectral Card Incantation (destroys 1 card; creates 4 random enhanced numbered cards)*|The Spectral Card Ouija (randomly turns entire hand into a single rank, -1 hand size)*|The Spectral Card Cryptid (creates 2 copies of a selected card)|The Marble Joker (creates a randomly-ranked Stone Card when a Blind is selected; requires the Enhancement to be replaced or removed)*|The Joker DNA (if the first hand is a single card, creates a permanent copy and adds it to the deck)|The Joker Certificate (creates a playing card with a random Seal)*;;*These methods randomly select a rank and may not provide a 10</div>
