Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it&spDon't tell nobody that you was abandoned&spI'm the only one that know about your tragedy&spI can't feel sorry when you lost random&spI can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom&spDrown yourself in expensive fabrics&spI think you picked up a lot of bad habits&spJust appreciate yourself&pWon't you think about you and I?&spJust grab my hand and look me in the eye&spBut this ain't something you should decide&spThis ain't something that you should decide&spWon't you think about you and I?&spJust grab my hand and look me in the eye&spBut this ain't something you should decide&spThis ain't something that you should decide&pBorn into status, tell nobody that you never had it&spDon't tell nobody that you was abandonеd&spI'm the only one that know about your tragedy&spI can't feel sorry 'causе your trust random&spI can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom&spDrown yourself in expensive fabrics&spI think you picked up a lot of bad habits&spJust appreciate yourself&pWon't you think about you and I?&spJust grab my hand and look me in the eye&spBut this ain't something you should decide&spThis ain't something that you should decide&spWon't you think about you and I?&spJust grab my hand and look me in the eye&spBut this ain't something you should decide&spThis ain't something that you should decide&pMy mama mad at me, I know I fucked up big&spMy girl mad at me, I know I fucked up big&spWhat's love?
