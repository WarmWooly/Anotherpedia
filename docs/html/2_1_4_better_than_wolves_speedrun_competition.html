      <h1>2.1.4 Better Than Wolves Speedrun Competition</h1>
      <div>The 2.1.4 {{iBetter Than Wolves Speedrun Competition}} was a speedrun competition hosted by Cahd for the Minecraft mod Better Than Wolves for the version 2.1.4 that was announced on May 20, 2025, and started on June 1, 2025. The competition ended on July 1, 2025, with the top 3 prizes going to JustBeCool ($60), Franzy ($45), and DraViGen ($25). Additionally, JustBeCool and Franzy got $75 for each having 12 top three times.

All players are required to follow the rules for Better Than Wolves speedrunning and post their runs onto the Better Than Wolves speedrun.com page. Collaberating with other players or cheating will deduct points or cause a player to be disqualified.<br><br>Scoring is based on movement on the leaderboard and posted scores to the speedrun.com page:<<tableAction|Points awarded||Submit a run to a category|1 point||Take 3rd place in a category|3 points||Take 2nd place in a category|5 points||Take 1st place in a category|10 pointstable>><br>Players who were on the leaderboard prior will automatically be awarded 1 point per submitted run in each category. Submitting a series of record takes (i.e. getting 3rd, then 1st) will only award the highest value unless another player on the board has moved up. Runs completed before the competition will not be awarded "Take nth place" points, and new runs must be submitted during the competition to award points. Cahd, who runs the event, does not participate and will not be counted for scoring. During the event, there were a total of 12 categories for Better Than Wolves speedrunning that players can run for, with each having an RSG (randomized seed) and a SSG (preset seed) version:<<tableCategory|Goal||Build Limit%|Reach the build limit of the world||Diamond%|Collect a diamond||Fish%|Catch and eat a fish with a fishing rod||Full Inventory%|Fill the player's inventory with 36 unique items||Nether%|Enter the Nether||Pants%|Craft and wear leather pantstable>><br>Based on the player who has the most points by the end of the competition, the prizes were $15 USD for 3rd most points, $35 for 2nd, and $50 for 1st. After enough donations, the prizes changed to $25 for 3rd, $45 for 2nd, and $60 for 1st. Additionally, two $75 prizes were awarded for holding the most top three times on the leaderboard.

The following are the final placements (usernames from speedrun.com):<<tablePlace|Player|Points||1st|JustBeCool|115||2nd|Franzy|56||3rd|DraViGen|12||4th|TheFatElle|11||5th|kriss2707|8||6th|Warm_Wooly|7||7th|sryskyhosh|3||8th|nuv8|2||8th|IwerSonsch|2table>>
