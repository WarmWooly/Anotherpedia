All players are required to follow the rules for Better Than Wolves speedrunning and post their runs onto the Better Than Wolves speedrun.com page.<<ref(content=link|https://www.speedrun.com/BTWMod(text=refCountref>> Collaberating with other players or cheating will deduct points or cause a player to be disqualified.&pScoring is based on movement on the leaderboard and posted scores to the speedrun.com page:<<tableAction|Points awarded||Submit a run to a category|1 point||Take 3rd place in a category|3 points||Take 2nd place in a category|5 points||Take 1st place in a category|10 pointstable>>&spPlayers who were on the leaderboard prior will automatically be awarded 1 point per submitted run in each category. Submitting a series of record takes (i.e. getting 3rd, then 1st) will only award the highest value unless another player on the board has moved up. Runs completed before the competition will not be awarded "Take nth place" points, and new runs must be submitted during the competition to award points. Cahd, who runs the event, does not participate and will not be counted for scoring. During the event, there were a total of 12 categories for Better Than Wolves speedrunning that players can run for, with each having an RSG (randomized seed (Minecraft)) and a SSG (preset seed) version:<<tableCategory|Goal||Build Limit%|Reach the build limit (Minecraft) of the world||Diamond%|Collect a diamond (Better Than Wolves)||Fish%|Catch and eat a fish (Better Than Wolves) with a fishing rod (Better Than Wolves)||Full Inventory%|Fill the player's inventory with 36 unique item (Minecraft)||Nether%|Enter the Nether (Better Than Wolves)||Pants%|Crafting (Better Than Wolves) and wear leather pants (Better Than Wolves)table>>&spBased on the player who has the most points by the end of the competition, the prizes were $15 United States Dollar for 3rd most points, $35 for 2nd, and $50 for 1st.
