      <h1>4-Hydroxyphenylacetone</h1>
      <div>4-Hydroxyphenylacetone is a metabolite of phenylacetone created when metabolizing amphetamine in the human liver. 4-hydroxyphenylacetone is known to irritate the eyes, skin, and lungs. 4-hydroxyphenylcacetone's chemical formula is Cs-b9Hs-b10Os-b2.

4-hydroxyphenylacetone can be naturally produced by metabolism when removing amphetamine from the body. After flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 catalyses the oxidative deamination of amphetamine into phenylacetone, an unknown enzyme or enzymes catalyse the phenylacetone into 4-hydroxyphenylacetone and benzoic acid.</div>
