The Drive-Thru Gauntlet" is a YouTube video made by Jim4123 on April 30, 2025, where Dylan and 4 of his friends take on the "DougDoug Drive-Thru Challenge" based on DougDoug video "Can I eat 10 Drive-Thru meals ordered by strangers? (WORLD RECORD)" where DougDoug and his friends go to various fast-food restaurant drive-thru and order whatever the person in front of them ordered.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc0Rs7FPPXI(text=refCountref>> This is a follow-up video to "DougDoug's Drive-Thru Challenge, But We're Lightweights" made in November 2024, where they only managed to go through 5 restaurants.
