      <h1>5 Lightweights VS. The Drive-Thru Gauntlet</h1>
      <div>"5 Lightweights VS. The Drive-Thru Gauntlet" is a YouTube video made by Jim4123 on April 30, 2025, where Dylan and 4 of his friends take on the "DougDoug Drive-Thru Challenge" based on DougDoug's video "Can I eat 10 Drive-Thru meals ordered by strangers? (WORLD RECORD)" where DougDoug and his friends go to various fast-food restaurant drive-thrus and order whatever the person in front of them ordered. This is a follow-up video to "DougDoug's Drive-Thru Challenge, But We're Lightweights" made in November 2024, where they only managed to go through 5 restaurants. In total, they managed to complete 13 restaurants before ending. The video is 35 minutes and 59 seconds in length.

There are a total of 5 members completing the challenge: Dylan (Jim4123; wearing light gray), Braeden (iGameToo; wearing brown), Victor (SquashGaming; wearing yellow), Nolan (wearing dark gray/blue), and later on, Mario (Mpro64; wearing black). Three of the members fasted the prior day. The challenge was started in the morning and ran up until nighttime.

The following breakdown is done per-restaurant: <<tableRestaurant|Food ordered|Notes||McDonald's|1 large coffee with creamers and sugar|Only Dylan, Braeden, Victor, and Nolan were ordering at the time, meeting up with Mario in a separate car before departing to the next location.||Burger King|Double bacon and sausage egg & cheese breakfast sandwich<br>French toast sticks<br>2 potato bites (hash browns)<br>Orange juice<br>Medium vanilla iced coffee|They left the two coffees they got for later on in the challenge when they could build up an appetite again.||Wendy's|2 sandwiches<br>Fries|N/A||Taco Bell|Grilled cheese burrito<br>A large drink|N/A||Chick-fil-A|Chicken sandwich<br>Small box of chicken nuggets<br>Waffle fries<br>Small juice box|N/A||Starbucks|Grande iced pecan oatmilk latte lined with caramel<br>Iced sugar cookie almond latte<br>Grande caramel brûlée latte|N/A||Arby's|Double roast beef sandwich<br>Jalapeño poppers<br>A drink|Mario left the group.
