      <h1>5 Lightweights VS. The Drive-Thru Gauntlet</h1>
      <div>"5 Lightweights VS. The Drive-Thru Gauntlet" is a YouTube video made by Jim4123 on April 30, 2025, where Dylan and 4 of his friends take on the "DougDoug Drive-Thru Challenge" based on DougDoug's video "Can I eat 10 Drive-Thru meals ordered by strangers? (WORLD RECORD)" where DougDoug and his friends go to various fast-food restaurant drive-thrus and order whatever the person in front of them ordered.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc0Rs7FPPXI(text=refCountref>> This is a follow-up video to "DougDoug's Drive-Thru Challenge, But We're Lightweights" made in November 2024, where they only managed to go through 5 restaurants. In total, they managed to complete 13 restaurants before ending. The video is 35 minutes and 59 seconds in length.

There are a total of 5 members completing the challenge: Dylan (Jim4123; wearing light gray), Braeden (iGameToo; wearing brown), Victor (SquashGaming; wearing yellow), Nolan (wearing dark gray/blue), and later on, Mario (Mpro64; wearing black). Three of the members fasted the prior day. The challenge was started in the morning and ran up until nighttime.

The following breakdown is done per-restaurant: <<tableRestaurant|Food ordered<<note(content=Not every item can be exactly accounted for and is an estimation based on the food shown in the video.
