      <h1>6 (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>6 is a rank of playing cards in Balatro that is worth 6 Chips when played without Modifiers or Jokers. 6s are considered to be a numbered card. The Abandoned Deck removes all face cards, so 6 is more likely to be drawn. The Erratic Deck randomly selects ranks, so 6 may be more or less likely depending on the selected ranks. The following are Jokers that 6 can trigger because of its rank:<<tableJoker|Effect||Even Steven|+4 Mult||Sixth Sense|If the first hand is a single 6, destroy the card and create a Spectral Cardtable>>&spMail-In Rebate allows the player to earn $5 on discard with the rank randomly selected at the start of the round, including 6. The Idol gives x2 Mult when a card of a randomly selected rank and suit is played, including 6s of any suit.

There are various methods to obtain cards with the rank 6, including:;;Standard Packs|Cards bought in the Shop with the Voucher Magic Trick|The Tarot Card Strength used on 5s|The Spectral Card Incantation (destroys 1 card; creates 4 random enhanced numbered cards)*|The Spectral Card Ouija (randomly turns entire hand into a single rank, -1 hand size)*|The Spectral Card Cryptid (creates 2 copies of a selected card)|The Marble Joker (creates a randomly-ranked Stone Card when a Blind is selected; requires the Enhancement to be replaced or removed)*|The Joker DNA (if the first hand is a single card, creates a permanent copy and adds it to the deck)|The Joker Certificate (creates a playing card with a random Seal)*;;*These methods randomly select a rank and may not provide a 6</div>
