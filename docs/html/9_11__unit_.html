      <h1>9/11 (unit)</h1>
      <div>9/11 (spoken as nine-eleven) has become a unit to measure tragedies based on the death toll of the September 11 attacks. One 9/11 equates to 2,996 deaths, which is often rounded to 3,000. Joe Biden used 9/11 as a unit describing the Hamas attack on Israel as "fifteen 9/11s" (despite the death toll only being 15,000, or five 9/11s). 9/11 was also compared to the daily death toll of COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
