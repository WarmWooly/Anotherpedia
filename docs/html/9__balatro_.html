      <h1>9 (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>9 is a rank of playing cards in Balatro that is worth 9 Chips when played without Modifiers or Jokers. 9s are considered to be a numbered card. The Abandoned Deck removes all face cards, so 9 is more likely to be drawn. The Erratic Deck randomly selects ranks, so 9 may be more or less likely depending on the selected ranks. The following are Jokers that 9 can trigger because of its rank:<<tableJoker|Effect||Odd Todd|+31 Chips||Cloud 9|Earn $1 per 9 in the full deck at the end of a Roundtable>>&spMail-In Rebate allows the player to earn $5 on discard with the rank randomly selected at the start of the round, including 9. The Idol gives x2 Mult when a card of a randomly selected rank and suit is played, including 9s of any suit.
