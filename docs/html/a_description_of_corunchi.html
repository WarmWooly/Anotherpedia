      <h1>a Description of Corunchi</h1>
      <div>"a Description of Corunchi" is a musical documentary which was produced by Wenamun and published by itemLabel on their YouTube channel of the same name, which as the title suggests, describes who Corunchi is.<br><br>The music in the video was made by Emamouse. The video was posted on September 1, 2023, sometime between 2 and 3 PM.

The video starts with the Fish Car pulling up to a house. The person who ordered opens the door as the delivery driver places down the bag of food to photograph, when shortly after Corunchi appears out of the frame and steals the bag off the ground. He is then seen flying amongst the clouds until he dives down to steal a bag containing fries.<br><br>After, there are several images of Corunchi swiping food such as a burger and fries, a hot dog, cookies, pizza, and a burrito. There are then multiple images of Corunchi stealing from a convenience store. Corunchi enters an open window at the top floor of a house afterwards to eat fettuccine Alfredo.<br><br>A photo of Corunchi supposedly being nice is then shown, but this is still debatable. He is then seen falling from the sky in a failed attempt to fly, and then riding on the bus, where Corunchi itches his right eye. Corunchi then enters another home with fettuccine Alfredo, but this time there is a card saying "For: Corunchi", where he then reveals his hidden eye on his chest. A person who he stole the fries from earlier in the video is seen watching Corunchi unveil his eye while staring down the food.

This documentary has mixed messages about Corunchi, alongside the fact that Corunchi has not been prosecuted for his crimes. It is uncertain the real reason of this video. It is speculated that it is used as an advertisement for the Corunchi plush on itemLabel's website, which is linked below in the video's description.
