The song follows Brian attempting to get [[groceries|grocery]] while avoiding a [[general manager]] who makes fun of his [[pants]], with Brian ordering food instead in the end. The video features graphics reminiscent of older [[video games|video game]] with an emphasis on [[rabbits|rabbit]] and the [[High|High Middle Ages]]/[[late Middle Ages]], having a mix of [[live action]] footage, [[2D background|2D background]] and [[animations|2D animation]], and [[UI overlays|UI overlay]].<<hrSynopsishr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9GLfcBXQCY(cap=The music video on [[YouTube]].yt>>Brian, appearing from behind a tree, begins his quest in The Tendre Woode. After crossing the Caverne of Sorrowes and fleeing from a [[squirrel]] back to The Tendre Woode, Brian heads to the Yon Strippe Mall before resting back in the woods. While resting, Brian recalls the general manager (played by Karen Han) laughing at his pants he made for the Solstice Dance. Brian enters The Corcomb's Arcade to get to the Cupola of the Valkyrie (the grocery store), only to flee when the general manager is there unexpectedly. Brain returns to The Corcomb's Arcade before heading off to The Store That Is Further Awaye, to yet again be blindsided by the general manager. Brian takes the Walke of the Wandought to the Kinchin's Hovel (Brian's apartment) with a bag of food.<<hrLyricshr>>Come, a jaunty quest awaits me!&spVenture farther than I've been before!&spAnd no, I'm not scared, though I'm frightfully underprepared&spTo brave the grocery store!&pMaybe I'll return triumphent&spOr some beast may feed upon me whole&spBut, hey!
