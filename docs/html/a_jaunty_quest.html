      <h1>A Jaunty Quest</h1>
      <div>"A Jaunty Quest" is a music video by Brian David Gilbert and Karen Han released on March 31, 2025. The song follows Brian attempting to get groceries while avoiding a general manager who makes fun of his pants, with Brian ordering food instead in the end. The video features graphics reminiscent of older video games with an emphasis on rabbits and the High/late Middle Ages, having a mix of live action footage, 2D background and animations, and UI overlays.

Brian, appearing from behind a tree, begins his quest in The Tendre Woode. After crossing the Caverne of Sorrowes and fleeing from a squirrel back to The Tendre Woode, Brian heads to the Yon Strippe Mall before resting back in the woods. While resting, Brian recalls the general manager (played by Karen Han) laughing at his pants he made for the Solstice Dance. Brian enters The Corcomb's Arcade to get to the Cupola of the Valkyrie (the grocery store), only to flee when the general manager is there unexpectedly. Brain returns to The Corcomb's Arcade before heading off to The Store That Is Further Awaye, to yet again be blindsided by the general manager. Brian takes the Walke of the Wandought to the Kinchin's Hovel (Brian's apartment) with a bag of food.

Come, a jaunty quest awaits me!&spVenture farther than I've been before!&spAnd no, I'm not scared, though I'm frightfully underprepared&spTo brave the grocery store!&pMaybe I'll return triumphent&spOr some beast may feed upon me whole&spBut, hey! It's ok! 'Cuz I'm just heading out for the day!&spI'm working toward my goal!&spThere's no reason to be stressed!&spThe danger scales are 6 at best!&spIt's not like there's a general manager&spWho is really mean to me&pShe made fun of my homemade pants&spThat I was breaking in before the Solstice Dance!&spBut, thankfully, she doesn't work weeknights, so-&spAhh, shoot! She's here!&pCome, a jaunty quest awaits me&spElsewhere where my pants won't be maligned!&sp'Cuz I know they rule, and that manager is such a tool&spFor insulting the pants that I designed!&spSomeday, I'll be strong, and stand up for myself&spBut probably not today&spBut now, I shall stray to the store that is further away, so I-&spOh my god, how does she also work here? What the-&pSo, I'll go home and I'll order some food on my phone!&spCongrats to me on another jaunty quest!&spK, this will last me a few days</div>
