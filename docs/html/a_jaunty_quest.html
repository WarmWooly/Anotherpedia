      <h1>A Jaunty Quest</h1>
      <div>"A Jaunty Quest" is a music video by Brian David Gilbert and Karen Han released on March 31, 2025. The song follows Brian attempting to get groceries while avoiding a general manager who makes fun of his pants, with Brian ordering food instead in the end. The video features graphics reminiscent of older video games with an emphasis on rabbits and the High/late Middle Ages, having a mix of live action footage, 2D background and animations, and UI overlays.

Brian, appearing from behind a tree, begins his quest in The Tendre Woode. After crossing the Caverne of Sorrowes and fleeing from a squirrel back to The Tendre Woode, Brian heads to the Yon Strippe Mall before resting back in the woods. While resting, Brian recalls the general manager (played by Karen Han) laughing at his pants he made for the Solstice Dance. Brian enters The Corcomb's Arcade to get to the Cupola of the Valkyrie (the grocery store), only to flee when the general manager is there unexpectedly. Brain returns to The Corcomb's Arcade before heading off to The Store That Is Further Awaye, to yet again be blindsided by the general manager. Brian takes the Walke of the Wandought to the Kinchin's Hovel (Brian's apartment) with a bag of food.
