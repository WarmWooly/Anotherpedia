      <h1>A splode</h1>
      <div>The person who made this a sploded, so this should not be taken Satirical page.<br>A splode (also written asplode or a-splode) is an Engrish comedy explosion, typically to the head. The term, especially within the context of "your head a splode", originates from the Homestar Runner series Strong Bad Email episode "video games (Strong Bad Email)", where Strong Bad uses the term upon defeating the theoretical player. A splosions can happen for many reasons, including cosuming specific food and drink, watching YouTube Poop, or division by zero. A splosions tend to be sudden and abrupt, meaning that anyone (even you) could a splode at any moment.</div>
