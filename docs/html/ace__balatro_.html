      <h1>Ace (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Ace is the highest rank of playing cards in Balatro that is worth 11 Chips when played without Modifiers or Jokers. Aces are neither numbered cards nor face cards. The Abandoned Deck removes all face cards, so Ace is more likely to be drawn. The Erratic Deck randomly selects ranks, so Aces may be more or less likely depending on the selected ranks. The following are Jokers that Ace can trigger because of its rank:<<tableJoker|Effect||Fibonacci|+8 Mult||Odd Todd|+31 Chips||Scholar|+20 Chips and +4 Mult||Superposition|Creates a random Tarot Card when a Straight with an Ace is playedtable>>&spMail-In Rebate allows the player to earn $5 on discard with the rank randomly selected at the start of the round, including Ace. The Idol gives x2 Mult when a card of a randomly selected rank and suit is played, including Aces of any suit.

There are various methods to obtain cards with the rank Ace, including:;;Standard Packs|Cards bought in the Shop with the Voucher Magic Trick|The Tarot Card Strength used on Kings|The Spectral Card Grim (destroys 1 card; creates 2 random enhanced Aces)|The Spectral Card Ouija (randomly turns entire hand into a single rank, -1 hand size)*|The Spectral Card Cryptid (creates 2 copies of a selected card)|The Marble Joker (creates a randomly-ranked Stone Card when a Blind is selected; requires the Enhancement to be replaced or removed)*|The Joker DNA (if the first hand is a single card, creates a permanent copy and adds it to the deck)|The Joker Certificate (creates a playing card with a random Seal)*;;*These methods randomly select a rank and may not provide an Ace</div>
