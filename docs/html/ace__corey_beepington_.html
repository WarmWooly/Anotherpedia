      <h1>Ace (Corey Beepington)</h1>
      <div>Ace is a sentient Panasonic PV-M1357W character created by Corey Beepington, introduced on Twitter and YouTube on February 23 and 24, 2025. Corey's videos about Ace are known as "Aceposting."

Ace is an off-white Panasonic CRT TV with a blue face comprised of simple lines on its screen. He can also play media, such as video games, shows, and movies from external sources (such as a VHS tape or a GameCube) or an internal cache of various media clips to express itself. He normally cannot speak, relying on facial expressions and media clips to get his thoughts across.

Ace can replay clips from media it has seen without having the corresponding VHS tape or external device normally needed to store the media. He can also feel objects or people touching him, hear sounds around him, view his surroundings, contact local emergency services, and perform a data wipe on himself. Ace can display his face, basic line art, external sources, media clips, or text on his screen. He can see the contents of his screen, and if the contents are from VHS, he can interact with the contents and eject the VHS at will. Ace is afraid of violence, such as the early scenes of Bambi or the game Doom. Ace can talk from a VHS Corey made, but he feels that line art is a part of who he is. Ace is friends with Corey and lives with him, but he grows concerned when Corey is anxious, upset, or sick.</div>
