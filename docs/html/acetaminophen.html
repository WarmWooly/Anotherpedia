For the brand, see  TYLENOL (brand).<br>Acetaminophen (also referred to as tylenol) is an oral over-the-counter analgesic most often used to relieve headaches, fevers, and other minor pain. Acetaminophen comes in many forms, including as capsules, caplets, and tablets of various sizes, including 200 mg, 325 mg, and most often 500 mg. Acetaminophen may also be combined with ibuprofen, an NSAID. Acetaminophen's chemical formula is Cs-b8Hs-b9NOs-b2. Acetaminophen is a colorless, odorless solid at room temperature and can cause skin and eye irritation. Consuming the standalone chemical at large doses is acutely toxic and can be harmful to aquatic life.</div>
