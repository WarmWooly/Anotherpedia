      <h1>Adjective</h1>
      <div>For the modifier for verbs and adjectives, see adverb.<br>An adjective is a grammatical term for words that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun. Adjectives are most often used before a noun (attributive adjectives), such as "the red car" or "the smart student," but when connected with a linking verb, the adjective can come after the noun (predicative adjectives), such as "the car is red" and "the student is smart." Adjectives may also follow directly after the noun with no linking verb (postpositive adjectives), such as "was there anything good," and they may even be used as nouns themselves (nominalized adjectives), such as "we need more good in the world."</div>
