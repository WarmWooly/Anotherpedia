      <h1>Adjective</h1>
      <div>For the modifier for verb and adjectives, see adverb.&spAn adjective is a grammar term for word that describe or modifiy a noun or pronoun. Adjectives are most often used before a noun (attributive adjective), such as "the red car" or "the smart student," but when connected with a linking verb, the adjective can come after the noun (predicative adjective), such as "the car is red" and "the student is smart." Adjectives may also follow directly after the noun with no linking verb (postpositive adjective), such as "was there anything good," and they may even be used as nouns themselves (nominalized adjective), such as "we need more good in the Earth."</div>
