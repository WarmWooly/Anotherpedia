  <h1>Adjective</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the modifier for verb and adjectives, see adverb.}}&spAn {{badjective}} is a grammar term for word that describe or modifiy a noun or pronoun. Adjectives are most often used before a noun (attributive adjective), such as "the {{ired}} car" or "the {{ismart}} student," but when connected with a linking verb, the adjective can come after the noun (predicative adjective), such as "the car is {{ired}}" and "the student is {{ismart}}." Adjectives may also follow directly after the noun with no linking verb (postpositive adjective), such as "was there anything {{igood}}," and they may even be used as nouns themselves (nominalized adjective), such as "we need more {{igood}} in the Earth."</div>
