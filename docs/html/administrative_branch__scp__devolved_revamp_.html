      <h1>Administrative Branch (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Administrative Branch (AB) is a role (SCP: Devolved Revamp) within SCP: Devolved Revamp who can run tests, vote on facility upgrades, arrest escaped inmates or intruders and run the facility. The AB gets an authorize tool (SCP: Devolved Revamp), which they can use only on Class D (SCP: Devolved Revamp) to run tests on them with the SCPs. The AB also gets handcuffs (SCP: Devolved Revamp), which they can use on any player besides other ABs to arrest them for breaking facility or role rules. The AB get a Desert Eagle XIX (SCP: Devolved Revamp) as well which can be used for self defense from hostile intruders or rouge Class D. AB members should focus on running the facility making sure things go smooth, use the control panel to change the alarm lights, and make sure all other facility staff are doing their jobs.

The AB has 5 levels, with each giving a new title. At level 3, their keycards (SCP: Devolved Revamp) access also increases.<<table |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Level 4|Level 5||Title|"Staff Manager"|"Committee Member"|"Site Coordinator"|"Board Director"|"Executive Council"||Tools|Authorize Tool, Handcuffs|-|-|-|-||{{bWeapons|Desert Eagle XIX|-|-|-|-||Keycard|Level 3 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|Level 3|Level 4 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|Level 4|Level 4table>>
