      <h1>Afterglow Ampharos</h1>
      <div>Afterglow Ampharos (also called Afterglow or Glow) is a Canadian YouTuber, Twitch streamer, and digital artist. As a self-described "Pokémon furry", he roleplays as an Ampharos Pokésona while streaming. Notably, he switches his VTuber avatar to be glowing when it becomes dark in-game. While his original content focused on Undertale, he has since branched into various indie games. His YouTube channel mostly consists of VODs and highlights.</div>
