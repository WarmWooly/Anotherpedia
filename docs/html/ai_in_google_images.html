      <h1>AI in Google Images</h1>
      <div>AI in Google Images refers to AI images being found within Google Images or under the "Images" tab in Google Search. Google's stance on AI images and other AI results is that if it follows their search ranking qualities of "expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness" then it should be a viable piece of "high-quality content". Broader topics, especially of real-life people, animals, plants, food, and other common objects or ideas are much less likely to have AI content appear under Google Images compared to more niche topics.</div>
