      <h1>AI piss filter</h1>
      <div>The AI piss filter is slang for the artificial yellowing of generative artificial intelligence image. This filter tends to have the background a lighter yellow hue, with color temperature given to objects within the scene, even if it makes the colors inaccurate for the prompt. This filter is considered a possible AI sign that an image was generated with AI. The AI piss filter can be avoided by prompt engineering for specific tones and cooler colors, and applications such as UnYellowGPT are designed to remove the filter. While the exact cause of the AI piss filter is unknown, suspected elements in the training set, such as aged photo scanning photo or art stylized with warmer hues, may influence the models towards applying the filter.</div>
