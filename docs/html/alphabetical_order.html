      <h1>Alphabetical order</h1>
      <div>Alphabetical order is an ordering system based on the place of a letter (linguistics) in a word inside of a list from where it is positioned in the alphabet. Alphabetical order goes A, B, C, ... X, Y, Z. If there are multiple elements with the same first letter, the next letter will be compared, and so on (lisp would go before list). Here is an example of alphabetical order with eight fruit:&spApple&spBanana&spBlueberry&spCranberry&spDurian&spPear&spStarfruit&spWatermelon</div>
