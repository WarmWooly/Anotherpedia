      <h1>Amigurumi</h1>
      <div>{{iAmigurumi}} is the Japanese art of creating small stuffed toys through crocheting or knitting. Amigurumi tend to be smaller in size and focus on hiding stuffing and avoiding visible seams. Works made through amigurumi include people, animals, characters, and objects. Within crocheting, pieces are typically made in rounds, with multiple pieces sewn together to form a completed amigurumi.</div>
