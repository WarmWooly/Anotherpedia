      <h1>Ampharos</h1>
      <div>Ampharos is a bipedal Electric type Pokémon from the second generation.

Ampharos has a large, rounded body with pairs of arms and legs, a tail, and a long neck to its head. Its body is yellow with a white underbelly. It has flipper-like arms and more defined legs with white "toes." Its tail has three black stripes connecting to a red bulb. Ampharos also has three black stripes along its neck. Its head has a pointed ovoid shape, with a mouth, a pair of brown eyes, an embedded red bulb, and a pair of similarly-shaped horns with two black stripes on each.&pAmpharos' official size is 4 ft and 7 in., while weighing 135.6 lbs. Shiny Ampharoses are pink with blue bulbs instead of yellow with red bulbs.&pAmpharos' name begins with ampere, a unit for electric current.

Ampharos' tail bulb can be used as  a beacon, especially for lost people, and was also used as communication through its light. This light is so bright, it is visible from space.

An Ampharos has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Ampharos is the 181st Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color yellow.&pAmpharos evolves from Flaaffy at level 30, which evolves from a level 15 Mareep. Ampharos' leveling rate is "Medium Slow".

When an Ampharos holds Ampharosite, it can Mega Evolve into Mega Ampharos, gaining the Dragon typing alongside Electric and overall increasing its stats. Ampharos has regrown its wool, now with a thick, puffy tail with bulbs scattered throughout and hair-like waves going down its neck and across its head, with a single bulb on top. Its horns are now curled, and its eyes are grey. Its "toes" are now black instead of white, while its underbelly has a more detailed shape. It remains the same size and weight as its non-Mega counterpart.</div>
