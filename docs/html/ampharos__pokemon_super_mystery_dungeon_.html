      <div><<info||Pokémon (fictional species)|Ampharos||Level (Pokémon)|54||Gender|Male||Ability (Pokémon)|Static (Pokémon ability)||Moves||Dragon Pulse (Pokémon)||Electro Ball (Pokémon)||Fire Punch (Pokémon)||Swagger (Pokémon)info>>Ampharos (also going by the nickname "Dashing Wanderer") is an Ampharos within Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon and the chief of the Expedition Society (Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon). He is first seen by the player (Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon) and their partner (Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon) early in the game within Serene Village (Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon), where the player picks up his dropped Connection Orb (Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon). When the player meets back up with Ampharos, he gives them basic gear and allows them to keep the Connection Orb. Later, Ampharos removes a rule ban children from the Expedition Society and formally induction the player and their partner in. Throughout the game, Ampharos leads the Expedition Society and aids in investigation the cause of Pokémon petrification. He is surprised to find out that the player is human after being told.<br><br>Ampharos is prone to getting lost while on his own due to his poor sense of direction. He tends to be lax and laid-back, especially when it comes to enforcing rule. He can and does override rules, even his own, at a whim to suit his needs. He is well-respected among the Expedition Society and views his members as friend. He sports a badge of the Expedition Society on the left of his chest.</div>
