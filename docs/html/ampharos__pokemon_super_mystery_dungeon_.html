      <h1>Ampharos (Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon)</h1>
      <div><<info||Pokémon|Ampharos||Level|54||Gender|Male||Ability|Static||Moves||Dragon Pulse||Electro Ball||Fire Punch||Swaggerinfo>>Ampharos (also going by the nickname "Dashing Wanderer") is an Ampharos within Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon and the chief of the Expedition Society. He is first seen by the player and their partner early in the game within Serene Village, where the player picks up his dropped Connection Orb. When the player meets back up with Ampharos, he gives them basic gear and allows them to keep the Connection Orb. Later, Ampharos removes a rule banning children from the Expedition Society and formally inducts the player and their partner in. Throughout the game, Ampharos leads the Expedition Society and aids in investigating the cause of Pokémon petrification. He is surprised to find out that the player is human after being told.&pAmpharos is prone to getting lost while on his own due to his poor sense of direction. He tends to be lax and laid-back, especially when it comes to enforcing rules. He can and does override rules, even his own, at a whim to suit his needs. He is well-respected among the Expedition Society and views his members as friends. He sports a badge of the Expedition Society on the left of his chest.</div>
