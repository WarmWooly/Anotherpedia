      <h1>Angle</h1>
      <div><<shortChange of direction between two linesshort>><<img(src=git/angle.gif(cap=An [[animation]] of a full rotation angle.img>>An {{bangle}} is the [[measure|measurement]] of the change in [[direction]] bewteen two [[lines|line]] or [[rays|ray (geometry)]] in [[mathematics]]. The [[point|point (geometry)]] where the two lines or rays meet up is called the [[vertex]], where the angle is measured around. Angles can be given sizes with several types of [[units|unit]], such as [[radians|radian]] and [[degrees|degree (angle)]]. Angles can be physically measured using a [[protractor]].&pSome types of angles include the [[zero degree angle]], [[acute angle]], [[right angle]], [[obtuse angle]], [[straight angle]], [[reflex angle]], and [[full rotation angle]].</div>
