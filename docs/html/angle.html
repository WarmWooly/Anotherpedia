      <div>An angle is the measure of the change in direction bewteen two lines or rays in mathematics. The point where the two lines or rays meet up is called the vertex, where the angle is measured around. Angles can be given sizes with several types of units, such as radians and degrees. Angles can be physically measured using a protractor.&pSome types of angles include the zero degree angle, acute angle, right angle, obtuse angle, straight angle, reflex angle, and full rotation angle.</div>
