      <h1>Anime Boston</h1>
      <div>Anime Boston is an annual anime convention held in the Spring in Boston, Massachusetts, USA under the New England Anime Society. The first Anime Boston was hosted in 2003, which is still running <<asofMay 2025>>, with the latest one being Anime Boston 2025. Anime Bostons 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic, reopening in 2022. Participants are often wearing cosplay of characters from anime, video games, and other media. Photoshoots, previews, gameshows, panels, fan works (especially AMVs), craft alongs, and interviews of those in the anime industry are held during the convention. Other locations, such as a dealer's room, artist's gallery, signature stations, and areas to play tabletop and video games, are also present at Anime Boston.</div>
