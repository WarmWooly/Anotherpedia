  <h1>Another Pedia (article)</h1>
  <div><<shortArticle about Wikipedia usage and Citizendiumshort>><<img(src=git/another pedia article.png(cap=A [[screenshot]] of "Another Pedia".img>>"{{bAnother Pedia}}" is an [[article]] on [[jennifermarohasy.com]], [[written|writing]] by [[Jennifer Marohasy]] on April 11, 2007, which can be <<link(src=https://jennifermarohasy.com/2007/04/another-pedia/(text=read herelink>>. The article covers Jennifer's experience reading an article titled "Wikipedia references a source of anxiety" in {{i[[The Australian]]}}. She first gives a short [[synopsis]] of the article, covering the [[ban]] in a [[college]] in [[Vermont]] of [[Wikipedia]] as a [[source]] and [[Jimmy Wales'|Jimmy Wales]] (the founder of Wikipedia) negative outlook on [[citing|citation]] [[encyclopedias|encyclopedia]]. She then mentions that she was given a [[note]] by [[David Tribe]] about [[Citizendium]], then links to the article "[[Citizendium aims to be better Wikipedia]]".<<safe<<hrCommentshr>>{{bSJT}} (April 11, 2007, 11:17 PM)<<quoNothing will ever rival Wikipedia for in depth articles on [[Anime]].quo>>{{bSchiller Thurkettle}} (April 12, 2007, 7:11 AM)<<quoIt’s perfectly justifiable to ban citing Wikipedia as a [[source]], for the same reason that citing the [[E. Britannica|Encyclopedia Britannica]] should be disallowed.&pIt has nothing to do with [[racism]], [[sexism]] or [[classism]]. It’s simply that these two resources only offer primers on the topics they cover, written by people whose credentials may or may not justify the faith a [[lazy]] [[researcher]] may wish to have in them.&pI’ve found both of these resources to be excellent starting points for research, but I would feel rather embarrassed to cite either of them as “authoritative.”quo>>{{bJennifer}} (April 12, 2007, 8:27 AM)<<quoand I was sent this link&sp<<link(src=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Life(text=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Lifelink>>quo>>{{bSteve}} (April 12, 2007, 5:08 PM)<<quowith you 100% [[shiller]]. wikipedia might be non-authoritive when you are writing an [[academic paper]], but it is fantastic for general [[knowledge]]/[[trivia]] etc, and often points you to the weightier articles on a [[topic]] if you need it too. its always a great [[starting point]].&pI disagree that citizendium will be better than wiki. it doesnt have a [[niche]]. why go for citizendium when you can buy the Britannica?&pWikipedia’s advantage is that it can cover lots of topics very quickly and is updated constantly.&pCitizendium requires [[moderator]] approval. this just slows it down, and puts an artificial stamp of authority on it that is unnecessary, because academics won’t be referencing it any more than they will wikipedia or e.brittanica.&pIt also suffers the potential for unjustified authority problem that any moderated [[forum]] suffers from (including the [[IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] it seems on this blog!) ie it purports to be authoritative, but . . . isn’t.&pAt least everyone knows that wikipedia is a free for all and there are no illusionsquo>>{{bSchiller Thurkettle}} (April 13, 2007, 7:11 AM)<<quoI’ve had a look at <<link(src=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Main_Page(text=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Main_Pagelink>> and it looks like a wiki worth citing.&pThe trouble with a lot of [[online research]] is the [[cost]]: there are lots of papers out there that you have to pay $30 or more to look at.&pBut these are vetted authors, so this “free access” notion for vetted authors is an exponentially better deal.&pMaybe one of our contributors could contact [[Middlebury College]] and see what their [[opinion]] is.quo>>{{bJohn Ray}} (April 13, 2007, 3:59 PM)<<quoThe article IS online:&p<<link(src=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w070319&s=rauchway032107(text=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w070319&s=rauchway032107link>>quo>>{{b<<link(src=https://globalwarmingwatch.blogspot.com/(text=Wadardlink>>}} (April 14, 2007, 4:24 AM)<<quoI stumbled upon [[Conservapedia]] a while ago:&p“Because we all know that [[reality]] has a [[liberal bias]]”&sp<<link(src=http://www.conservapedia.com/Main_Page(text=http://www.conservapedia.com/Main_Pagelink>>quo>>{{bHans Erren}} (April 16, 2007, 7:17 PM)<<quoDon’t worry, all wiki climate topics adhere to IPCC standards.
