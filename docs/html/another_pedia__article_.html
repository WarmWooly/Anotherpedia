      <h1>Another Pedia (article)</h1>
      <div>"Another Pedia" is an article on jennifermarohasy.com, written by Jennifer Marohasy on April 11, 2007, which can be <<link(src=https://jennifermarohasy.com/2007/04/another-pedia/(text=read herelink>>. The article covers Jennifer's experience reading an article titled "Wikipedia references a source of anxiety" in The Australian. She first gives a short synopsis of the article, covering the ban in a college in Vermont of Wikipedia as a source and Jimmy Wales' (the founder of Wikipedia) negative outlook on citing encyclopedias. She then mentions that she was given a note by David Tribe about Citizendium, then links to the article "Citizendium aims to be better Wikipedia".

SJT (April 11, 2007, 11:17 PM)Nothing will ever rival Wikipedia for in depth articles on Anime.Schiller Thurkettle (April 12, 2007, 7:11 AM)It’s perfectly justifiable to ban citing Wikipedia as a source, for the same reason that citing the E. Britannica should be disallowed.<br><br>It has nothing to do with racism, sexism or classism. It’s simply that these two resources only offer primers on the topics they cover, written by people whose credentials may or may not justify the faith a lazy researcher may wish to have in them.<br><br>I’ve found both of these resources to be excellent starting points for research, but I would feel rather embarrassed to cite either of them as “authoritative.”Jennifer (April 12, 2007, 8:27 AM)and I was sent this link<br><<link(src=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Life(text=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Lifelink>>Steve (April 12, 2007, 5:08 PM)with you 100% shiller. wikipedia might be non-authoritive when you are writing an academic paper, but it is fantastic for general knowledge/trivia etc, and often points you to the weightier articles on a topic if you need it too. its always a great starting point.<br><br>I disagree that citizendium will be better than wiki. it doesnt have a niche. why go for citizendium when you can buy the Britannica?<br><br>Wikipedia’s advantage is that it can cover lots of topics very quickly and is updated constantly.<br><br>Citizendium requires moderator approval. this just slows it down, and puts an artificial stamp of authority on it that is unnecessary, because academics won’t be referencing it any more than they will wikipedia or e.brittanica.<br><br>It also suffers the potential for unjustified authority problem that any moderated forum suffers from (including the IPCC it seems on this blog!) ie it purports to be authoritative, but . . . isn’t.<br><br>At least everyone knows that wikipedia is a free for all and there are no illusionsSchiller Thurkettle (April 13, 2007, 7:11 AM)I’ve had a look at <<link(src=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Main_Page(text=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Main_Pagelink>> and it looks like a wiki worth citing.<br><br>The trouble with a lot of online research is the cost: there are lots of papers out there that you have to pay $30 or more to look at.<br><br>But these are vetted authors, so this “free access” notion for vetted authors is an exponentially better deal.<br><br>Maybe one of our contributors could contact Middlebury College and see what their opinion is.John Ray (April 13, 2007, 3:59 PM)The article IS online:<br><br><<link(src=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w070319&s=rauchway032107(text=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w070319&s=rauchway032107link>><<link(src=https://globalwarmingwatch.blogspot.com/(text=Wadardlink>> (April 14, 2007, 4:24 AM)I stumbled upon Conservapedia a while ago:<br><br>“Because we all know that reality has a liberal bias”<br><<link(src=http://www.conservapedia.com/Main_Page(text=http://www.conservapedia.com/Main_Pagelink>>Hans Erren (April 16, 2007, 7:17 PM)Don’t worry, all wiki climate topics adhere to IPCC standards. William Conolley takes care of that.</div>
