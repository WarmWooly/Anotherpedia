Anotherpedia was Replit's removal of legacy hosting hosted on Replit, but was then moved over to Glitch (IDE) on January 3rd, 2024. On May 31st, 2025, to avoid Shutdown of Glitch, Anotherpedia was then moved to GitHub Pages. On March 26th, 2025, anotherpedia.com was registered on Namecheap, redirecting to anotherpedia.glitch.me. Following the move to GitHub Pages, the domain anotherpedia.com would be used for Anotherpedia, hosted on warmwooly.github.io/Anotherpedia/. Anotherpedia uses an HTML file called index.html. It is linked to a CSS file titled style.css, and a pair of JavaScript files names script.js and pages.js. script.js contains all the code for website display, page selection, tooltip, text generation, and other User Experience-related tasks, while pages.js holds all the data for the pages and redirects, including this one!<br><br>image popup (anotherpedia) are controlled by popup.html (to handle the window for displaying the image) and popup.js (to handle popup transformations). Pages are stored as website snapshot in a folder, which contains the raw contents of the page to be scraped by web crawler. There is also a sitemap, sitemap.xml, that lists all the available pages.<br><br>Anotherpedia uses Cloudflare to get Discord webhook to send a text file to the Anotherpedia Discord, which is protected with reCAPTCHA. Cloudflare is also used to redirect from snapshots and to grab the latest pages.js. Anotherpedia had a sister website, Anotherpedia.txt, which was used to store and share text and pages. Anotherpedia is a portmanteau of another and Wikipedia. Anotherpedia used to go under the name Stupipedia.</div>
