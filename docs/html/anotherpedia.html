      <h1>Anotherpedia</h1>
      <div>Anotherpedia is a knock-off of Wikipedia, being an encyclopedic website full of different facts and useless knowledge about things.&pAnotherpedia was made by Warm_Wooly on August 28th, 2023, making Anotherpedia &currentAge days old. The first page created was first. Since its creation, Anotherpedia has amassed a total of &allPages pages, beating its goal of making 1000 pages on July 10th, 2024. The next goal is 2500 pages.&pThe logo, comprised of three short cylinders using the grayish-blue the webpage's color scheme is based on, was made in Google Drawings. There is no symbolism nor meaning behind the logo. It was updated on February 24, 2024, to now have a border and an increase in image quality, alongside converting it from .ico to .svg.&pAnotherpedia was formerly hosted on Replit, but was then moved over to Glitch on January 3rd, 2024. On May 31st, 2025, to avoid Glitch's shutdown, Anotherpedia was then moved to GitHub Pages. On March 26th, 2025, anotherpedia.com was registered on Namecheap, redirecting to anotherpedia.glitch.me. Following the move to GitHub Pages, the domain anotherpedia.com would be used for Anotherpedia, hosted on warmwooly.github.io/Anotherpedia/. Anotherpedia uses an HTML file called index.html. It is linked to a CSS file titled style.css, and a pair of JavaScript files names script.js and pages.js. script.js contains all the code for website display, page selection, tooltips, text generation, and other UX-related tasks, while pages.js holds all the data for the pages and redirects, including this one!&pImage popups are controlled by popup.html (to handle the window for displaying the image) and popup.js (to handle popup transformations).&pPages are stored as snapshots in a folder, which contains the raw contents of the page to be scraped by web crawlers. There is also a sitemap, sitemap.xml, that lists all the available pages.&pAnotherpedia uses CloudFlare to get Discord webhooks to send a text file to the Anotherpedia Discord, which is protected with reCAPTCHA. Anotherpedia had a sister website, Anotherpedia.txt, which was used to store and share text and pages. Anotherpedia is a portmanteau of another and Wikipedia. Anotherpedia used to go under the name Stupipedia.&pTo join our community, go to <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>> for the Anotherpedia Discord!</div>
