      <h1>Anotherpedia best practices</h1>
      <div>This [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] is used to show the {{bbest practices}} when [[making/editing|how to make/edit pages]] pages on [[Anotherpedia]]. It will be broken up into three sections: {{brequirements}}, {{blimited exeptions}}, and {{bpreferred}}.<<hrRequirementshr>>These are practices that are expected to be in every page!<<hr2Short texthr2>>Short text, as denoted with <<nostyle<<short short>>nostyle>>, is used to give a concise summary of a page. This is required for every page to have. The following are examples of good short texts: ;;[[Abbreviation]] - {{iShortening of a word or phrase}}|[[Neptune]] - {{i8th planet in the Solar System}}|[[Lanturn]] - {{i171st Water and Electric type Pokémon;;These summaries accurately convey to readers what a page is about and may even contain information a reader was looking for. Here are some examples of what not to do:;;Abbreviation - {{iTo compress a word or into a shorter form}} (this is technically the same, but it could be more concise)|Neptune - {{i8th planet from the Sun in the Solar System between Uranus and Pluto}} (this contains too much information, and in this case, it may be factually incorrect as Neptune and Pluto trade places in distance from the Sun due to Pluto's orbit)|Lanturn - {{iAn anglerfish-like magical creature}} (this contains little valuable information and would leave readers confused);;<<hr2Imageshr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia best practices.png(cap=This is the caption.img>>Images are always required on pages. Even if the image is only tangentially related, it should be used when possible. Avoid blurry/low-quality images when possible. Captions should be concise, but every image must have a caption. Formatting images using (brightImg, (darkImg, (bigImg, and (leftImg should be used when needed. Avoid re-using images from other pages where possible.<<hr2Grammarhr2>>Grammar is important, even here! People will always make mistakes, so it is good to check over work to verify that it is grammatically correct. Small errors may appear, but that's just part of the process! May it be an extra space, two "and"s used in a list, or an exclamation point instead of a period, it's not the end of the world. Here are three examples of great, mediocre, and poor grammar:<<quoThere is no scientific consensus on what was before the Big Bang.&pThere is no consensus from scientists on what was before the Big Bang .&pthere isn;t a consensus from science on before the big bangquo>>Pages submitted with abhorrent grammar will be rejected, but small errors are allowed and will be fixed.<<hrLimited exceptionshr>>There may be a few exceptions to these practices as needed.<<hr2Good titleshr2>>Pages aren't news articles or sensational media, but pools of information. When possible, use the least words that accurately describe what you are talking about, such as [[water]] and [[book]]. Pages on media, such as books and movies, should use italics (<<nostyle{{i }}nostyle>>). For example, the book {{i[[Put a Cherry on Top: Generosity in Life & Leadership]]}}. When multiple topics share the same name, use parentheses to differentiate between them, such as the word [[taboo]] and the board game [[{{iTaboo}} (game)]].<<hr2Bold opening wordhr2>>In the opening of most pages, the page's title is inside the opening sentence. When it is, it should be bolded using <<nostyle{{b }}nostyle>>. Here are some examples:;;[[Abbreviation]] - An {{babbreviation}} is any shortening of a term to condense the content.|[[Neptune]] - {{bNeptune}} is the 8th [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]].|[[Lanturn]] - {{bLanturn}} is an [[anglerfish]]-like [[Water|Water Type (Pokémon)]] and [[Electric type|Electric type (Pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] from the [[second generation|Generation II (Pokémon)]].;;Now these opening sentences all include the topic and are thusly bolded. Here are a few cases where it would be best to not include the full topic, where it isn't bolded:;;[[List of pages related to Anotherpedia]] - This is a list of all [[pages|page (Anotherpedia)]] which relate to [[Anotherpedia]] in [[alphabetical order]].|[[How to use Anotherpedia]] - [[Anotherpedia]] is designed closely to [[Wikipedia]], following many similar principles for navigation and use.|[[Pageman]] - This page is a custom minigame of [[hangman]] using the names of pages.;;<<hr2Don't link everythinghr2>>[[Links|link (Anotherpedia)]] are used for navigation on Anotherpedia. They are especially useful for allowing readers to understand difficult terms or find out related information on a topic. [[However]], [[not]] [[everything]] [[needs|need]] [[a|a (word)]] [[link|hyperlink]]. If links are overused, they tend to just clutter the page. Use links when it is necessary or if you find it to be a good fit. Not every link will be perfect, and there may be words or topics that would be better suited to be turned into a link. That's why the iterative process on Anotherpedia will only allow pages to get better over time. Avoid splitting complex topics up, such as [[time paradox]] into [[time]] [[paradox]]. Also avoid any unneeded use, even if there is a page connected to it, such as "there were [[2]] [[apples|apple]] at the store" (2 should not be linked).<<hr2Italics are {{iimportanthr2>>Italics, added with <<nostyle{{i }}nostyle>>, should be used when writing down proper titles. This includes the titles of {{ibooks}}, {{imovies}}, {{isong albums}}, {{igames}} and other relevant content. Unironically, the [[{{iU.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual}} (Chapter 11)]] is a great source of information when confused about italics. Feel free to also look it up and see if that use case would require italics or not. Italics should be used for {{iemphasis}} sparingly, but it can help stick words out better than {{bbolding}} them.<<hr2Header orderhr2>>Headers are extremely useful for breaking up information into more manageable chunks, as seen here. However, the largest header <<nostyle<<hr hr>>nostyle>> should be used, then hr2 and hr3. Headers should be as short as possible and relevant to the page.<<hrPreferredhr>>These practices are not required, but they should be used when needed.<<hr2Use of &ampp and &ampsphr2>><<nostyle&p and &spnostyle>> are some of the most useful tools for an editor. <<nostyle&pnostyle>> should be used for full breaks between topics, while <<nostyle&spnostyle>> is better off for formatting. Avoid using multiple "<<nostyle&pnostyle>>"s and "<<nostyle&spnostyle>>"s to make larger breaks. Also avoid using <<nostyle&pnostyle>> and <<nostyle&spnostyle>> at the end of sections before headers, as headers are automatically spaced away from the text.<<hr2Use other pages as referencehr2>>Making a page similar to another prior topic? Feel free to reference similar pages for formatting and styling to help keep your page consistent with other pages. The pages for {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[items|item (Minecraft)]], for example ([[coal|coal (Minecraft)]] and [[flint|flint (Minecraft)]]), share similar sections containing information.<<hr2Disambiguationhr2>>Sometimes there are a lot of different topics with the same or similar names. Making a disambiguation page can help make it easier to go to the page a reader is looking for. It is best used when three or more terms are similar, such as [[cannonball (disambiguation)]] and [[goo (disambiguation)]].<<shortBest practices when writing on Anotherpediashort>></div>
