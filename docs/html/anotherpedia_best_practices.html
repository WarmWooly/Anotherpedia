      <h1>Anotherpedia best practices</h1>
      <div>This page is used to show the best practices when making/editing pages on Anotherpedia. It will be broken up into three sections: requirements, limited exeptions, and preferred.
These are practices that are expected to be in every page!
Short text, as denoted with , is used to give a concise summary of a page. This is required for every page to have. The following are examples of good short texts: ;;Abbreviation - Shortening of a word or phrase|Neptune - 8th planet in the Solar System|Lanturn - 171st Water and Electric type Pokémon;;These summaries accurately convey to readers what a page is about and may even contain information a reader was looking for. Here are some examples of what not to do:;;Abbreviation - {{iTo compress a word or into a shorter form (this is technically the same, but it could be more concise)|Neptune - 8th planet from the Sun in the Solar System between Uranus and Pluto (this contains too much information, and in this case, it may be factually incorrect as Neptune and Pluto trade places in distance from the Sun due to Pluto's orbit)|Lanturn - An anglerfish-like magical creature (this contains little valuable information and would leave readers confused);;
Images are always required on pages. Even if the image is only tangentially related, it should be used when possible. Avoid blurry/low-quality images when possible. Captions should be concise, but every image must have a caption. Formatting images using (brightImg, (darkImg, (bigImg, and (leftImg should be used when needed. Avoid re-using images from other pages where possible.
Grammar is important, even here! People will always make mistakes, so it is good to check over work to verify that it is grammatically correct. Small errors may appear, but that's just part of the process! May it be an extra space, two "and"s used in a list, or an exclamation point instead of a period, it's not the end of the world. Here are three examples of great, mediocre, and poor grammar:Pages submitted with abhorrent grammar will be rejected, but small errors are allowed and will be fixed.
There may be a few exceptions to these practices as needed.
Pages aren't news articles or sensational media, but pools of information. When possible, use the least words that accurately describe what you are talking about, such as water and book. Pages on media, such as books and movies, should use italics ( ). For example, the book Put a Cherry on Top: Generosity in Life & Leadership. When multiple topics share the same name, use parentheses to differentiate between them, such as the word taboo and the board game Taboo (game).
In the opening of most pages, the page's title is inside the opening sentence. When it is, it should be bolded using . Here are some examples:;;Abbreviation - An abbreviation is any shortening of a term to condense the content.|Neptune - Neptune is the 8th planet from the Sun in the Solar System.|Lanturn - Lanturn is an anglerfish-like Water and Electric type Pokémon from the second generation.;;Now these opening sentences all include the topic and are thusly bolded. Here are a few cases where it would be best to not include the full topic, where it isn't bolded:;;List of pages related to Anotherpedia - This is a list of all pages which relate to Anotherpedia in alphabetical order.|How to use Anotherpedia - Anotherpedia is designed closely to Wikipedia, following many similar principles for navigation and use.|Pageman - This page is a custom minigame of hangman using the names of pages.;;
Links are used for navigation on Anotherpedia. They are especially useful for allowing readers to understand difficult terms or find out related information on a topic. However, not everything needs a link. If links are overused, they tend to just clutter the page. Use links when it is necessary or if you find it to be a good fit. Not every link will be perfect, and there may be words or topics that would be better suited to be turned into a link. That's why the iterative process on Anotherpedia will only allow pages to get better over time. Avoid splitting complex topics up, such as time paradox into time paradox. Also avoid any unneeded use, even if there is a page connected to it, such as "there were 2 apples at the store" (2 should not be linked).
Italics, added with , should be used when writing down proper titles. This includes the titles of books, movies, song albums, games and other relevant content. Unironically, the U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual (Chapter 11) is a great source of information when confused about italics. Feel free to also look it up and see if that use case would require italics or not. Italics should be used for emphasis sparingly, but it can help stick words out better than bolding them.
Headers are extremely useful for breaking up information into more manageable chunks, as seen here. However, the largest header 
 should be used, then hr2 and hr3. Headers should be as short as possible and relevant to the page.
These practices are not required, but they should be used when needed.
&p and &sp are some of the most useful tools for an editor. &p should be used for full breaks between topics, while &sp is better off for formatting. Avoid using multiple "&p"s and "&sp"s to make larger breaks. Also avoid using &p and &sp at the end of sections before headers, as headers are automatically spaced away from the text.
Making a page similar to another prior topic? Feel free to reference similar pages for formatting and styling to help keep your page consistent with other pages. The pages for Minecraft items, for example (coal and flint), share similar sections containing information.
Sometimes there are a lot of different topics with the same or similar names. Making a disambiguation page can help make it easier to go to the page a reader is looking for. It is best used when three or more terms are similar, such as cannonball (disambiguation) and goo (disambiguation).</div>
