      <h1>Anotherpedia log</h1>
      <div>This is the Anotherpedia log, acting as a crude update log for Anotherpedia, with the most recent changes being shown at the top. This was made on February 18th, 2024, so any substantial changes made to Anotherpedia prior to this will not be listed.



Notices have been added to Anotherpedia! These act like the small warning or information boxes on Wikipedia. They come with a new <<notice>> tag, with configurable colors, image, and content. Disclaimers (<<nomedical>>, <<nolegal>>, and <<nodanger>>) are now formatted as notices. There is also new <<wip>> and <<wips>> tags for content that is a work in progress (Anotherpedia).



Files on Anotherpedia are being moved to Cloudflare's R2 Object Storage! This is mainly because GitHub limits the size of pages to be under 1 gigabyte. Under Cloudflare, there's 10 free GB, with the ability to dynamically increase size at a small fee. As Anotherpedia isn't massive, and it took over two years to fill up 1 GB (including all the other files on the site), I'm doubtful that the 10 GB limit will be reached. This should also mean site updates will be pushed faster to users, as all the files won't have to be uploaded each time. Files will now be hosted on cdn.anotherpedia.com, which can be accessed with "cdn/" within infobox have been added to Anotherpedia! With this comes the removal (through a multi-hour editing session) of those clunky "Stats" sections. Instead, there will now be a box that can contain images and information about a topic! While it's scope is primarily focused towards simple information from pages that already had an pre-infobox workaround, infoboxes may be used in more types of pages in the future.



Pages can now be subitted to the Anotherpedia Discord (application) (which can be joined at <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>>) with .txt files! While this solution isn't as robust as Anotherpedia.txt, it is a good solution in the meantime that fixes the issue of non-members from being unable to submit pages, alongside making it easier for page creation and edit requests to be made. I'd like to revisit this in the future to more closely align with a 1-link solution to view new page requests, but this is a huge step in that direction. It also has reCAPTCHA implemented, which will require some tweaking, but it'll be good to have even a simple security system for page submissions for now.

Pages in the form of .txt files can be dropped over the page edit fields to automatically populate them with their content. This will allow faster viewing of .txt files natively on Anotherpedia (instead of manually copying the information yourself). When paired with the ability to send .txt files to the Discord server, it works hand-in-hand for a smoother sharing experience.



When searching, especially on smaller screens, the search area will no longer overflow past the bottom of the screen. Polish such as this will keep Anotherpedia intuitive and "useful", even in edge cases, as more pages get added.



Anotherpedia used to be hosted on the open IDE and website host Glitch (IDE). As they are Shutdown of Glitch on June 8, 2025, I needed to move Anotherpedia over to a new host. As I was already using GitHub Pages to serve images, I decided it would be easiest to move the entire site over. The main downside is the loss of Anotherpedia.txt, as only static website can be hosted over GitHub Pages. This means that there is currently no built-in way to send new pages/page edits to the Anotherpedia Discord without directly copying the code and manually sending it.

I've been sitting on the anotherpedia.cpm website domain since March 2025 from Namecheap after failing to find an affordable host for the SSL certificate needed for the site to be hosted as HTTPS. However, GitHub Pages offers this service for free with Let's Encrypt, allowing anotherpedia.com to be used for the site. The direct GitHub page, warmwooly.github.io/Anotherpedia/, can also be used, but is to be avoided when possible. Hopefully, over the coming days, the new link will become available over Google Search and possibly Bing Search in time for anotherpedia.glitch.me's shutdown.



There is now a <<nostyle<<top>> tag used to get the top image from a page, filling a similar purpose to the <<disam>> tag, just without grabbing every image in the page.

In the settings, users can now choose to additionally search pages based on the content within each page. This will have the lowest priority in the search list and will be disabled by default due to the tendency for the search relevancy to be less consistent than using the page names and short text.

In the settings, users can now have the top image appear alongside the reset of the search information (kinda like Wikipedia). This new feature will be enabled by default.



There is now a <<asof>> tag used to keep track of information that may change over time, which can be viewed on as ofs in Anotherpedia pages.



There are now keybinds that can be used for editing Anotherpedia! This update is intended to greatly reduce the struggle of editing due to the smooth integration of keybinds such as Ctrl + I, codeCtrl + K, and <<tableAlt + T (this is a table)table>><br>It also includes pre-fabs of tags for img, vid, yt, note, and ref to also reduce the time spent writing and remembering syntax!

Improvements to how the search bar and other button options will now allow for a seamless transition between a horizontal and vertical view when using Anotherpedia.



There are now achievements on Anotherpedia under Anotherpedia achievements, collected by exploring pages, playing minigames, and just interacting with the site! All achievements are saved locally.



Sound files are now fully supported on Anotherpedia! Using  will allow users to input .mp3 files, .ogg files, and .wav files, without any (src= or (cap=.



Created and edited pages can now directly be sent to the Anotherpedia <<link(src=https://discord.com/invite/JHHMAEpEej(text=Discordlink>>. This will greatly expand the capabilities of the site, allowing any user to send in their edits and new page ideas without the hassle of joining Discord and sending the link themselves. This will hopefully allow for an increase in the widespread use of this silly website.



There is now a dedicated Git repository for Anotherpedia, that can be found at <<link(src=https://github.com/WarmWooly/Anotherpedia/(text=github.com/WarmWooly/Anotherpedialink>>. Currently, it's only used as a much better storage solution for hosting images. Instead of codeimages/ and codevideos/, codegit/ will be used to refer to images hosted on GitHub. codeimages/ and other redirects will still be supported, but new images will solely be added under codegit/. As over 1,200 images had to be transferred, there is a real chance some images may be broken/missing, and it will be high-priority to make sure that all images are correctly added and usable as if the change never occurred.

When going to pages that haven't been made ending in (Minecraft), the following will appear:It seems this page (Anotherpedia) hasn't been made yet! Feel free to how to make/edit pages or check to see if there is a corresponding article on the Minecraft Wiki (<<link(src=https://minecraft.wiki/w/cobblestone(text=minecraft.wiki/w/cobblestonelink>>).This feature, like the prior redirects to Wikipedia, are just made to allow users to learn more about topics they are interested in, and this feature may be extended to other wikis in the future.

On mobile, tables used to jut outside the screen, allowing for the entire page to be scaled and horizontally scrolled. Tables will now create a horizontal scroll bar when their size extends out from the screen on mobile devices, fixing this issue.

Code text can now be used like other formatting, such as codehere and codeover here using code. This will make it easier to incorporate programming concepts, variables, and other technical information in a format that contrasts against the standard text on Anotherpedia.



When there are red links to pages that do not exist, the following will appear:It seems this page (Anotherpedia) hasn't been made yet! Feel free to how to make/edit pages or check to see if there is a corresponding article on Wikipedia (<<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example(text=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/examplelink>>).This feature is not made to supplement Anotherpedia for Wikipedia, but rather a crude method to allow users to learn more about a subject when a page has not been made yet. It is still a priority to create pages on everything, even if Wikipedia or other online encyclopedia cover it.

In the settings, the size of the sidebar can now be changed. This is mainly used to give more space to the section titles, as they can easily be cramped by the current size. The original 10% will remain the default size unless changed in the future.



Videos are now fully supported on Anotherpedia! Using  will allow users to input .mp4 files, .avi files, .mov files, and other videos, sharing the same styling as images (such as (src= and (cap=).



References have now been added, allowing sources to be cited for texts when need be. References still won't be required in any capacity, but are moreso a nice-to-have. They work the same as notes, having a tooltip an a separate section automatically generated at the bottom.

Notes used to be manually set, where the user would have to put in n[1], n[2], n[3], and so on to label notes. This is no longer the case! Replacing the (text= field with noteCount or refCount for notes and references respectively will automatically count and set the appearance to be accurate.



Main page: Anotherpedia disclaimer<br>The Anotherpedia disclaimer has been made, fully covering how Anotherpedia is imperfect, imprecise, and not made for medical, legal, or informative use. It can be seen at the bottom of every page, allowing users to easily access this disclaimer. There are also new tags, reflected in How to make/edit pages, on addable disclaimers to pages. These addable disclaimers are NOT required, but are generally a good addition to improve the user experience. There are currently three disclaimers (more may be added in the future; this will not be updated):<<nolegal>><<nomedical>><<nodanger>>



A new text styling, anti-italic text, has been added to reverse italic text. This is reflected in How to make/edit pages, using the code ai . The main purpose is to allow for grammatically correct italicizing when all the text is already italics. See the following example:This section contains spoiler for the show {{aiThe Simpsons.}}

Searching now is practically instant, causing no lag! I'm surprised I didn't think of stopping the search as soon as it had enough pages to fill the search list. Instead of iterating over all the 900+ pages as of writing this four separate times and checking them, it will now stop searching when it no longer needs to find more pages. This especially helps when starting a search, no longer checking over hundreds of pages that start with or include 'a' or 's.' Overall, it will aid in making the user experience when navigating Anotherpedia greatly!



Section links will now be automatically generated when loading a page, allowing for easier navigation through larger pages (including this one). It currently does not update with the page as it is being edited because it is very expensive to run the check every page update. I do plan in the future to bring this feature to mobile users and to make it work while editing the page. For now, it is a great start in increasing the navigational ability of Anotherpedia.



Anotherpedia now has a built-in system for Anotherpedia.txt, allowing users to quickly turn their page's code into a sharable link! This will greatly decrease the time from copying the information of a page and sending it, helping decrease the burden of text limits and short expirations with most text-sharing website.



Authors will now have differing color based on the number of pages they have edited or helped on. This looks cool and gives a quick way to show how prominent you are in Anotherpedia. This can be disabled in the settings under author colors.

Anotherpedia now has a Discord (application) server! The primary use is to share pages and edits, alongside internet meme, bug (computer programming), and other idea with other people. Go to <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>> to join!



External links can now show a small preview of the website being visited, which can be enabled in the settings. Because many websites prohibit cross-origin view via iframe, external link preview is disabled by default. <<web>> tags will now also display a message when trying to load HTTP sites:Sorry, http://www.websitename.com couldn't be loaded because it is served over HTTP and not HTTPS.

Notes will now generate an area at the bottom of the page, allowing notes to contain usable links. It will also give a method for users to view notes when tooltips are disabled. The notes area is enabled by default. You can also click on notes to go to the note mentioned. The notes area can be disabled in the settings.



Anotherpedia can now be found on Google Search! It is still a bit of a Work in progress, as it may take day or week for Google to pick up the favicon and the custom description meta (HTML), but it is out there and at the top of Google! Take that アナザーぺディア!<br><br>Also, looking forward to getting this on Bing Search as well in the near future. There won't be any announcement for it, but it would be nice to have.

When writing or editing pages, the old system only allowed credit to a single author. This is no more, with a new and simple system to allow multiple authors to get credit! To credit multiple authors, all you need to do is add a comma between authors, such as:EditKing,WikipediaIsBetterThere is no limit to the number of authors and the footer will create multiple links for the different authors. The main use is for when two authors work together or if an author makes a substantial edit to a page in which credit would be due.

Want to properly format video game, species, and TV show? Well, now you can in the title! Just like italics normally, you can now put italics into titles. All relevant pages have undergone italicizing, now with grammatically correct titling!</div>
