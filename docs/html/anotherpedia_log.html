      <h1>Anotherpedia log</h1>
      <div>This is the Anotherpedia log, acting as a crude update log for Anotherpedia, with the most recent changes being shown at the top. This was made on February 18th, 2024, so any substantial changes made to Anotherpedia prior to this will not be listed.



A problem that's been bugging me is how long it takes for a new page to appear on the site from pages.js. Fear no longer, as Cloudflare will now automatically detect when pages.js is being loaded, and grab the latest version of the file from GitHub! This is most useful for seeing approved pages on the site without having to wait 5-10 minutes for it to eventually populate. This change will hopefully make it easier for pages to be added and prevent users from being out-of-date while on Anotherpedia.



Pages will now have snapshots! This means that the contents of a page will now be periodically stored as an HTML file, storing the data of that page when last updated. It will also automatically add new pages to the system. Alongside this comes a sitemap that will also update, allowing Google Search Console to (hopefully) read pages and directly serve them from Google Search. It will take a few days to verify that this works, as Google can be slow on this kind of stuff. Maybe Anotherpedia can de-throne Wikipedia? Fat chance, but it's nice to dream.



Pages will now have a rate limit when being submitted to the Anotherpedia Discord. The solution is straightforward: giving a 15-second timeout per submission. This will mainly show that the page has been successfully sent to prevent user error. This isn't nearly close to anything robust, but it is good for now. If the case arises, additional restrictions (such as enabling challenges through reCAPTCHA per submission) can be put into place, but this system does the bare minimum while being (hopefully) bug-free.



Section links will now be automatically generated when loading a page, allowing for easier navigation through larger pages (including this one). It currently does not update with the page as it is being edited because it is very expensive to run the check every page update. I do plan in the future to bring this feature to mobile users and to make it work while editing the page. For now, it is a great start in increasing the navigational ability of Anotherpedia.



Anotherpedia now has a built-in system for Anotherpedia.txt, allowing users to quickly turn their page's code into a sharable link! This will greatly decrease the time from copying the information of a page and sending it, helping decrease the burden of text limits and short expirations with most text-sharing sites.



Authors will now have differing colors based on the number of pages they have edited or helped on. This looks cool and gives a quick way to show how prominent you are in Anotherpedia. This can be disabled in the settings under author colors.

Anotherpedia now has a Discord server! The primary use is to share pages and edits, alongside memes, bugs, and other ideas with other people. Go to <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>> to join!



External links can now show a small preview of the website being visited, which can be enabled in the settings. Because many websites prohibit cross-origin view via iframes, external link preview is disabled by default. <<web>> tags will now also display a message when trying to load HTTP sites:Sorry, http://www.websitename.com couldn't be loaded because it is served over HTTP and not HTTPS.

Notes will now generate an area at the bottom of the page, allowing notes to contain usable links. It will also give a method for users to view notes when tooltips are disabled. The notes area is enabled by default. You can also click on notes to go to the note mentioned. The notes area can be disabled in the settings.



Anotherpedia can now be found on Google Search! It is still a bit of a WIP, as it may take days or weeks for Google to pick up the favicon and the custom description, but it is out there and at the top of Google! Take that アナザーぺディア!<br><br>Also, looking forward to getting this on Bing Search as well in the near future. There won't be any announcement for it, but it would be nice to have.

When writing or editing pages, the old system only allowed credit to a single author. This is no more, with a new and simple system to allow multiple authors to get credit! To credit multiple authors, all you need to do is add a comma between authors, such as:EditKing,WikipediaIsBetterThere is no limit to the number of authors and the footer will create multiple links for the different authors. The main use is for when two authors work together or if an author makes a substantial edit to a page in which credit would be due.

Want to properly format games, species, and shows? Well, now you can in the title! Just like italics normally, you can now put italics into titles. All relevant pages have undergone italicizing, now with grammatically correct titling!</div>
