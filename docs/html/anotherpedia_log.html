  <h1>Anotherpedia log</h1>
  <div><<shortUpdate log for Anotherpediashort>>This is the {{bAnotherpedia log}}, acting as a crude [[update log]] for [[Anotherpedia]], with the most recent changes being shown at the top. This was made on February 18th, 2024, so any substantial changes made to Anotherpedia prior will not be listed.<<hrNovember 12th 2025hr>><<hr2Send limitinghr2>>Pages will now have a [[rate limit]] when being submitted to the Anotherpedia Discord. The solution is straightforward: giving a 15-second timeout per submission. This will mainly show that the page has been successfully sent to prevent user error. This isn't nearly close to anything robust, but it is good for now. If the case arises, additional restrictions (such as enabling challenges through reCAPTCHA per submission) can be put into place, but this system does the bare minimum while being (hopefully) bug-free.<<hrOctober 11th 2025hr>><<hr2Infoboxeshr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia infobox.png(cap=The infobox for [[Automated Permanence Rune ({{iNot Lazy Chainmail}})]].img>>[[Infoboxes|infobox]] have been added to Anotherpedia! With this comes the removal (through a multi-hour editing session) of those clunky "Stats" sections. Instead, there will now be a box that can contain images and information about a topic! While it's scope is primarily focused towards simple information from pages that already had an pre-infobox workaround, infoboxes may be used in more types of pages in the future.<<hrOctober 8th 2025hr>><<hr2Submitting pageshr2>>Pages can now be subitted to the Anotherpedia [[Discord|Discord (application)]] (which can be joined at <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>>) with .txt files! While this solution isn't as robust as Anotherpedia.txt, it is a good solution in the meantime that fixes the issue of non-members from being unable to submit pages, alongside making it easier for page creation and edit requests to be made. I'd like to revisit this in the future to more closely align with a 1-link solution to view new page requests, but this is a huge step in that direction. It also has [[reCAPTCHA]] implemented, which will require some tweaking, but it'll be good to have even a simple security system for page submissions for now.<<hr2Dropping .txt fileshr2>>Pages in the form of .txt files can be dropped over the page edit fields to automatically populate them with their content. This will allow faster viewing of .txt files natively on Anotherpedia (instead of manually copying the information yourself). When paired with the ability to send .txt files to the Discord server, it works hand-in-hand for a smoother sharing experience.<<hrAugust 8th 2025hr>><<hr2Search overflow preventionhr2>>When searching, especially on smaller screens, the search area will no longer overflow past the bottom of the screen. Polish such as this will keep Anotherpedia intuitive and "useful", even in edge cases, as more pages get added.<<hrMay 31st 2025hr>><<hr2Move to GitHub Pageshr2>>Anotherpedia used to be hosted on the open [[IDE]] and [[website host]] [[Glitch|Glitch (IDE)]]. As they are [[shutting down|Shutdown of Glitch]] on June 8, 2025, I needed to move Anotherpedia over to a new host. As I was already using [[GitHub Pages]] to serve images, I decided it would be easiest to move the entire site over. The main downside is the loss of [[Anotherpedia.txt]], as only [[static sites|static website]] can be hosted over GitHub Pages. This means that there is currently no built-in way to send new pages/page edits to the Anotherpedia Discord without directly copying the code and manually sending it.<<hr2Anotherpedia.comhr2>>I've been sitting on the anotherpedia.cpm [[domain|website domain]] since March 2025 from [[Namecheap]] after failing to find an affordable host for the [[SSL certificate]] needed for the site to be hosted as [[HTTPS]]. However, GitHub Pages offers this service for free with [[Let's Encrypt]], allowing anotherpedia.com to be used for the site. The direct GitHub page, warmwooly.github.io/Anotherpedia/, can also be used, but is to be avoided when possible. Hopefully, over the coming days, the new link will become available over [[Google Search]] and possibly [[Bing Search]] in time for anotherpedia.glitch.me's shutdown.<<hrMay 12th 2025hr>><<hr2Top taghr2>>There is now a <<nostyle<<top>>nostyle>> tag used to get the top image from a page, filling a similar purpose to the <<nostyle<<disam>>nostyle>> tag, just without grabbing every image in the page.<<hr2Search using page contenthr2>>In the [[settings]], users can now choose to additionally search pages based on the content within each page. This will have the lowest priority in the search list and will be disabled by default due to the tendency for the search relevancy to be less consistent than using the page names and short text.<<hr2Images in searchhr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia images in search.png(cap=Images appearing alongside the search 'stake'.img>>In the settings, users can now have the top image appear alongside the reset of the search information (kinda like Wikipedia). This new feature will be enabled by default.<<hrJanuary 15th 2025hr>><<hr2As of taghr2>>There is now a <<nostyle<<asof>>nostyle>> tag used to keep track of information that may change over time, which can be viewed on [[as ofs in Anotherpedia pages]].<<hrNovember 21st 2024hr>><<hr2Keybindshr2>>There are now keybinds that can be used for editing Anotherpedia! This update is intended to greatly reduce the struggle of editing due to the smooth integration of keybinds such as {{iCtrl + I}}, {{codeCtrl + K}}, and <<tableAlt + T (this is a table)table>>&spIt also includes pre-fabs of tags for img, vid, yt, note, and ref to also reduce the time spent writing and remembering syntax!<<hr2Mobile navigation improvementshr2>>Improvements to how the search bar and other button options will now allow for a seamless transition between a horizontal and vertical view when using Anotherpedia.<<hrSeptember 20th 2024hr>><<hr2Achievementshr2>>There are now achievements on Anotherpedia under [[Anotherpedia achievements]], collected by exploring pages, playing minigames, and just interacting with the site! All achievements are saved locally.<<hrAugust 22nd 2024hr>><<hr2Audiohr2>>Sound files are now fully supported on Anotherpedia! Using <<nostyle<<aud and aud>>nostyle>> will allow users to input .mp3 files, .ogg files, and .wav files, without any (src= or (cap=.<<hrJuly 29th 2024hr>><<hr2Sending Editshr2>>Created and edited pages can now directly be sent to the Anotherpedia <<link(src=https://discord.com/invite/JHHMAEpEej(text=Discordlink>>. This will greatly expand the capabilities of the site, allowing any user to send in their edits and new page ideas without the hassle of joining Discord and sending the link themselves. This will hopefully allow for an increase in the widespread use of this silly website.<<hrJune 18th 2024hr>><<hr2Git repositoryhr2>>There is now a dedicated [[Git repository]] for Anotherpedia, that can be found at <<link(src=https://github.com/WarmWooly/Anotherpedia/(text=github.com/WarmWooly/Anotherpedialink>>. Currently, it's only used as a {{imuch}} better storage solution for hosting images. Instead of {{codeimages/}} and {{codevideos/}}, {{codegit/}} will be used to refer to images hosted on GitHub. {{codeimages/}} and other redirects will still be supported, but new images will solely be added under {{codegit/}}. As over 1,200 images had to be transferred, there is a real chance some images may be broken/missing, and it will be high-priority to make sure that all images are correctly added and usable as if the change never occurred.<<hr2Minecraft Wiki redirectshr2>>When going to pages that haven't been made ending in (Minecraft), the following will appear:<<quoIt seems this [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] hasn't been made yet! Feel free to [[make it|how to make/edit pages]] or check to see if there is a corresponding article on the [[Minecraft Wiki]] (<<link(src=https://minecraft.wiki/w/cobblestone(text=minecraft.wiki/w/cobblestonelink>>).quo>>This feature, like the prior redirects to Wikipedia, are just made to allow users to learn more about topics they are interested in, and this feature may be extended to other wikis in the future.<<hr2Scrollable tableshr2>>On mobile, tables used to jut outside the screen, allowing for the entire page to be scaled and horizontally scrolled. Tables will now create a horizontal scroll bar when their size extends out from the screen on mobile devices, fixing this issue.<<hr2Inline codehr2>>Code text can now be used like other formatting, such as {{codehere}} and {{codeover here}} using <<nostyle{{code}}nostyle>>. This will make it easier to incorporate programming concepts, variables, and other technical information in a format that contrasts against the standard text on Anotherpedia.<<hrMay 16th 2024hr>><<hr2Wikipedia redirectshr2>>When there are red links to pages that do not exist, the following will appear:<<quoIt seems this [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] hasn't been made yet! Feel free to [[make it|how to make/edit pages]] or check to see if there is a corresponding article on [[Wikipedia]] (<<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example(text=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/examplelink>>).quo>>This feature is not made to supplement Anotherpedia for Wikipedia, but rather a crude method to allow users to learn more about a subject when a page has not been made yet. It is still a priority to create pages on [[everything]], even if Wikipedia or other [[online encylopedias|online encyclopedia]] cover it.<<hr2Sidebar sizehr2>>In the [[settings]], the size of the sidebar can now be changed. This is mainly used to give more space to the section titles, as they can easily be cramped by the current size. The original 10% will remain the default size unless changed in the future.<<hrMay 12th 2024hr>><<hr2Videoshr2>>Videos are now fully supported on Anotherpedia! Using <<nostyle<<vid and vid>>nostyle>> will allow users to input .mp4 files, .avi files, .mov files, and other videos, sharing the same styling as images (such as (src= and (cap=).<<hrMay 2nd 2024hr>><<hr2Referenceshr2>>References have now been added, allowing sources to be cited for texts when need be. References still won't be required in any capacity, but are moreso a nice-to-have. They work the same as notes, having a tooltip an a separate section automatically generated at the bottom.<<hr2Automatic notes and referenceshr2>>Notes used to be manually set, where the user would have to put in <<nostyle{{n[1]}}, {{n[2]}}, {{n[3]}}, and so onnostyle>> to label notes. This is no longer the case! Replacing the (text= field with noteCount or refCount for notes and references respectively will automatically count and set the appearance to be accurate.<<hrApril 29th 2024hr>><<hr2Anotherpedia disclaimerhr2>>{{tMain page: [[Anotherpedia disclaimer]]}}&spThe Anotherpedia disclaimer has been made, fully covering how Anotherpedia is imperfect, imprecise, and not made for medical, legal, or informative use. It can be seen at the bottom of every page, allowing users to easily access this disclaimer. There are also new tags, reflected in [[How to make/edit pages]], on addable disclaimers to pages. These addable disclaimers are {{bNOT}} required, but are generally a good addition to improve the user experience. There are currently three disclaimers (more may be added in the future; this will not be updated):<<quo<<nolegal>><<nomedical>><<nodanger>>quo>><<hrApril 24th 2024hr>><<hr2Anti-italic texthr2>>A new text styling, anti-italic text, has been added to reverse italic text. This is reflected in [[How to make/edit pages]], using the code <<nostyle{{ai }}nostyle>>. The main purpose is to allow for grammatically correct italicizing when all the text is already italics. See the following example:<<quo{{iThis section contains [[spoilers|spoiler]] for the show {{ai[[The Simpsons]]}}.}}quo>><<hr2Search optimizationhr2>>Searching now is practically instant, causing no lag! I'm surprised I didn't think of stopping the search as soon as it had enough pages to fill the search list. Instead of iterating over all the 900+ pages as of writing this four separate times and checking them, it will now stop searching when it no longer needs to find more pages. This especially helps when starting a search, no longer checking over hundreds of pages that start with or include 'a' or 's.' Overall, it will aid in making the user experience when navigating Anotherpedia greatly!<<hrMarch 15th 2024hr>><<hr2Sections in sidebarhr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia sections cropped.png(cap=The sidebar for [[{{iThe Simpsons}} (season 7)]] (cropped for space).img>>Section links will now be automatically generated when loading a page, allowing for easier navigation through larger pages (including this one). It currently does not update with the page as it is being edited because it is very expensive to run the check every page update. I do plan in the future to bring this feature to mobile users and to make it work while editing the page. For now, it is a great start in increasing the navigational ability of Anotherpedia.<<hrMarch 2nd 2024hr>><<hr2Anotherpedia.txt compatabiltyhr2>>Anotherpedia now has a built-in system for [[Anotherpedia.txt]], allowing users to quickly turn their page's code into a sharable link! This will greatly decrease the time from copying the information of a page and sending it, helping decrease the burden of text limits and short expirations with most [[text-sharing sites|text-sharing website]].<<hrFebruary 24th 2024hr>><<hr2Author colorshr2>>Authors will now have differing [[colors|color]] based on the number of pages they have edited or helped on. This looks cool and gives a quick way to show how prominent you are in Anotherpedia. This can be disabled in the settings under {{bauthor colors}}.<<hr2Discord serverhr2>>Anotherpedia now has a [[Discord|Discord (application)]] server! The primary use is to share pages and edits, alongside [[memes|internet meme]], [[bugs|bug (computer programming)]], and other [[ideas|idea]] with other people. Go to <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>> to join!<<hrFebruary 23rd 2024hr>><<hr2Preview external linkshr2>>External links can now show a small preview of the website being visited, which can be enabled in the [[settings]]. Because many websites prohibit cross-origin view via [[iframes|iframe]], {{bexternal link preview}} is disabled by default. <<nostyle<<web>>nostyle>> tags will now also display a message when trying to load [[HTTP]] sites:<<quoSorry, {{bhttp://www.websitename.com}} couldn't be loaded because it is served over HTTP and not HTTPS.quo>><<hr2Notes areahr2>><<safe<<img(src=git/noteArea.png(cap=The note area for the page [[Ayds]].(bigImgimg>>safe>>Notes will now generate an area at the bottom of the page, allowing notes to contain usable links. It will also give a method for users to view notes when tooltips are disabled. The notes area is enabled by default. You can also click on notes to go to the note mentioned. The notes area can be disabled in the settings.<<hrFebruary 18th 2024hr>><<hr2Google Search availabilityhr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia google old.png(cap=The result for searching {{ianotherpedia}} on Google Search on Feb 18, 2024.(bigImgimg>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia google.png(cap=The result for searching {{ianotherpedia}} on Google Search on Mar 14, 2024.(bigImgimg>>Anotherpedia can now be found on [[Google Search]]! It is still a bit of a [[WIP|Work in progress]], as it may take [[days|day]] or [[weeks|week]] for Google to pick up the [[favicon]] and the custom [[description|description meta (HTML)]], but it is out there and at the top of Google!<<safe Take that [[アナザーぺディア]]!safe>>&pAlso, looking forward to getting this on [[Bing Search]] as well in the near future. There won't be any announcement for it, but it would be nice to have.<<hr2Multiple author credithr2>>When writing or editing pages, the old system only allowed credit to a single author. This is no more, with a new and simple system to allow multiple authors to get credit! To credit multiple authors, all you need to do is add a comma between authors, such as:<<quoEditKing,WikipediaIsBetterquo>>There is no limit to the number of authors and the footer will create multiple links for the different authors. The main use is for when two authors work together or if an author makes a substantial edit to a page in which credit would be due.<<hr2Italic titleshr2>>Want to properly format [[games|video game]], [[species]], and [[shows|TV show]]? Well, now you can in the title! Just like {{iitalics}} normally, you can now put italics into titles. All relevant pages have undergone italicizing, now with grammatically correct titling!</div>
