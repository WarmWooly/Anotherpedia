      <h1>Ante (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>An Ante is a scaling factor within Balatro that increases the game difficulty over time. Each Ante has 3 Blinds (Balatro): a Small Blind (Balatro), a Big Blind (Balatro), and a Boss Blind (Balatro). Every 8 Antes, a Finisher Boss Blind (Balatro) is given instead. run (Balatro) start at Ante 1, and to win a run, the player must make it to Ante 8. After Ante 8, a player can continue in Endless (Balatro) to continue beating increasingly difficult Antes. Higher Antes increase the chip requirement (Balatro) to beat each blind. Green Stake (Balatro) and Purple Stake (Balatro) increase the scaling between Antes, while Plasma Deck (Balatro) doubles the chip requirement. Beating a Boss Blind increases the Ante, while using the vouchers (Balatro) Hieroglyph (Balatro) and Petroglyph (Balatro) decreases the Ante once. The highest Ante that can be reached without Balatro glitches is Ante 39, as the game reaches naneinf (Balatro), which is unreachable. The following are the chip requirements based on the Ante for the required Antes to win a run:<<tableAnte|Base|Green Stake|Purple Stake||r<1|r100|r100|r100||r1|r300|r300|r300||r2|r800|r900|r1,000||r3|r2,000|r2,600|r3,200||r4|r5,000|r8,000|r9,000||r5|r11,000|r20,000|r25,000||r6|r20,000|r36,000|r60,000||r7|r35,000|r60,000|r110,000||r8|r50,000|r100,000|r200,000table>></div>
