      <h1>Antimetabolite</h1>
      <div>An antimetabolite is a molecule used to inhibit the production of metabolites, slowing down or halting metabolism. Cells may be harmed by an antimetabolite as metabolites serve important roles in the cell and the inhibition will reduce these important metabolites. On the flip side, antimetabolites can be used to stop a cell from metabolizing too many metabolites or be used to intentionally kill the cell (such as in cancer treatment).</div>
