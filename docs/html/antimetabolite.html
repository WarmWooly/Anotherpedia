      <h1>Antimetabolite</h1>
      <div>An antimetabolite is a molecule used to enzyme inhibitor the production of metabolite, slowing down or halting metabolism. cell (biology) may be harmed by an antimetabolite as metabolites serve important roles in the cell and the inhibition will reduce these important metabolites. On the flip side, antimetabolites can be used to stop a cell from metabolizing too many metabolites or be used to intentionally kill the cell (such as in antimetabolites in cancer treatment).</div>
