      <h1>Apartment</h1>
      <div>An apartment is a set of rooms constituting a residence for multiple people. The building that contains apartments is known as an apartment building. They are typically smaller compared to other residences and often are rented by the people living inside. Apartments give shelter at a cheaper cost compared to a house, especially because of the uniform nature behind apartments.</div>
