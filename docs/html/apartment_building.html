      <h1>Apartment building</h1>
      <div>An apartment building is a building that contains multiple apartments. When multiple apartment buildings are in the same area under the same company, it is known as an apartment complex. Apartment buildings allow the holding of a significant number of people in a tighter space, making a compacted residence that is easier to create and maintain.</div>
