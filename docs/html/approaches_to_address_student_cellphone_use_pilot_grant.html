      <h1>Approaches to Address Student Cellphone Use Pilot Grant</h1>
      <div>The Approaches to Address Student Cellphone Use Pilot Grant is a grant made by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, or DESE for short. It is a grant under FY2024 with the fund code of 729.
The purpose of the grant is to combat inappropriate electronic use to reduce bad mental health effects and increase attention in class. The priority is to either make new policies or revise current policies in schools, with schools considered "chronically underperforming" being the first to receive them. Only public schools, charter schools, and educational collaboratives can receive the grant. The funding is based on the Federal Coronavirus Relief Program, with roughly $800,000 able to be used. The money will be distributed based on student counts, with up to $25,000 for 951+ students. It will start on the approval date and end on June 30th, 2024. The unit it is attributed to is the Office of Student and Family Support.</div>
