      <h1>Arc length</h1>
      <div>Arc length, represented with s or Arc, is the distance between two points on a curve.&pOn a circle, the arc length can be calculated using the radius and the angle in radians, with the equation s = θr. On a unit circle (where the radius is 1), the arc length is equal to the angle in radians.</div>
