      <h1>Archives (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Archives or Archive Room is a secret location in the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp based around SCP: Devolved Classic, including game asset from Classic. It can be accessed by clicking on the middle '9' on the title for SCP-999 (SCP: Devolved Revamp) room in Sector 2. The room is split into three sections: the Comically Long Hallway, the Combative Groups Archive, and the Hangout Area.

The Comically Long Hallway is a hallway connecting the other two rooms. From exiting the Combative Groups Archive, the left wall has nine images of former SCP: Devolved Classic staff, while the right has the top lined with screenshot from Classic, a scrollable menu with game moderator, game admin, and Roblox developer, and the text lines "COMICALLY LONG HALLWAY" and "Welcome to the Archives". Against the right wall on the floor are notes and letters used in Classic. The middle of the hallway is separated by a large bush, with small trees in the corners and the middle of the hall.

The Combative Groups Archive has various community (Roblox) who were active on Classic. The back and left walls contain information about various groups and the months they were active. The logos for the groups are framed at the top of the back and left walls. A non-functional gate to Sector 2 from Classic is to the right. Crate, shelving unit, and a file cabinet/mainframe computer, and a sign with the room's name also lay along the sides of the room.

The Hangout Area has basic, mostly non-functional amenedies for player (Roblox) to interact in. A sign with the room's name is at the front, with the top of the right wall containing the role instructions from Classic. Two large couches sit in front of a TV with a pair of speaker units on the right. To the left is a small kitchen with refridgerator, a kitchen stove, canned salt, and a countertop with six stool. Behind the sign are two solid, floating rectangles with screenshots from Classic.</div>
