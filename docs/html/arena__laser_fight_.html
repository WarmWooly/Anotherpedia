      <h1>Arena (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Arena is a small indoor map in Laser Fight loosely based on laser tag arenas. Players spawn in one of the four raised side sections with a windowed wall for protection. The center of Arena is comprised of 2 floors, a bottom one with several brick-textured barriers, and a raised one with gaps. Dozens of pillars stretch from the floor to the ceiling, acting as simple obstructions throughout the map. A glowing platform with four colors extends from a central area, which can be used by players to orient themselves on the symmetric map. As guns tend to spawn towards the center of the map, players will be incentivized to go out into the open center to get better weapons while avoiding crossfire from opponents above and around them.</div>
