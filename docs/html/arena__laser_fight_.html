  <h1>Arena ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortLaser tag arena map in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/arena laser fight.png(cap=The map Arena.img>>{{bArena}} is a small indoor [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox Game)]]}} loosely based on [[laser tag arenas|laser tag arena]]. Players spawn in one of the four raised side sections with a windowed wall for protection. The center of Arena is comprised of 2 floors, a bottom one with several brick-textured barriers, and a raised one with gaps. Dozens of pillars stretch from the floor to the ceiling, acting as simple obstructions throughout the map. A glowing platform with four colors extends from a central area, which can be used by players to orient themselves on the symmetric map. As [[guns|gun (Laser Fight)]] tend to [[spawn|gun spawning (Laser Fight)]] towards the center of the map, players will be incentivized to go out into the open center to get better weapons while avoiding crossfire from opponents above and around them.</div>
