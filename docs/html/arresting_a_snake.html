      <h1>Arresting a snake</h1>
      <div>Arresting a snake describes the action of putting a snake or other serpent into a position to prevent movement while being handled within the operations of law enforcement. There is precedent for law enforcement to need to restain a snake, such as in 2016 in Singleton, New South Wales, Australia when a boa constrictor broke into a home, ate a small dog, and strangled the owner. Restraining snakes by law enforcement are usually followed up by local animal control taking the snake from there.

The most realistic method to restrain a snake is to hold it, especially pet snakes, which are likely harmless. Putting a container over the snake, such as a trash bin or a bucket, can also be used to quickly prevent a hostile snake from getting away. Handcuffs should not be used to restain a snake as they can easily escape (even when folded).</div>
