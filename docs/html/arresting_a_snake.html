There is precedent for law enforcement to need to restain a snake, such as in 2016 in [[Singleton|Singleton, New South Wales]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] when a [[boa constrictor]] broke into a home, ate a small [[dog]], and strangled the owner.<<ref(content=link|https://time.com/4564292/police-arrest-snake/(text=refCountref>> Restraining snakes by law enforcement are usually followed up by local [[animal control]] taking the snake from there.<<hrMethods of restrainthr>><<safe<<img(src=git/arresting a snake.png(cap=An unrealistic method to arrest a snake with handcuffs on [[r/shitposting]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/shitposting/comments/12u2hoo/if_you_ever_need_to_arrest_a_snake/(text=refCountref>>(leftImgimg>>safe>>The most realistic method to restrain a snake is to [[hold it|snake holding]], especially [[pet snakes|pet snake]], which are likely harmless.
