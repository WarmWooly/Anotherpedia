  <h1>Arsenal (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bArsenal}} is a mode (Laser Fight) in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}} based on the gun-swapping mechanic in {{iArsenal (Roblox game)}} where players start with a Basic Gun (Laser Fight) and get a new gun (Laser Fight) every time they get a kill. Guns will not gun spawning (Laser Fight) and can't be dropped in this mode. Unlike {{iArsenal}}, there is no set list of guns to go through, just that each gun has to be unique from the last and can only be swapped out by getting a kill, regardless of the source (such as a Turret (Laser Fight) or Nextbot (Laser Fight)). There is also no win condition for getting through a number of guns.</div>
