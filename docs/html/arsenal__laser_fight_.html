      <h1>Arsenal (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Arsenal is a mode in Laser Fight based on the gun-swapping mechanic in Arsenal where players start with a Basic Gun and get a new gun every time they get a kill. Guns will not spawn and can't be dropped in this mode. Unlike Arsenal, there is no set list of guns to go through, just that each gun has to be unique from the last and can only be swapped out by getting a kill, regardless of the source (such as a Turret or Nextbot). There is also no win condition for getting through a number of guns.</div>
