  <h1>Arsenal ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<short{{iArsenal}}-based mode in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/arsenal laser fight.png(cap=The Arsenal mode selected.img>>{{bArsenal}} is a [[mode|mode (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} based on the gun-swapping mechanic in {{i[[Arsenal|Arsenal (Roblox game)]]}} where players start with a [[Basic Gun|Basic Gun (Laser Fight)]] and get a new [[gun|gun (Laser Fight)]] every time they get a kill. Guns will not [[spawn|gun spawning (Laser Fight)]] and can't be dropped in this mode. Unlike {{iArsenal}}, there is no set list of guns to go through, just that each gun has to be unique from the last and can only be swapped out by getting a kill, regardless of the source (such as a [[Turret|Turret (Laser Fight)]] or [[Nextbot|Nextbot (Laser Fight)]]). There is also no win condition for getting through a number of guns.</div>
