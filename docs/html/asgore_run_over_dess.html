      <div>{{iAsgore Run over Dess}} is a GIF of the character Asgore (Deltarune) as seen in Deltarune running over Dess (Deltarune) with his truck, posted by Triki_Tr0y onto Twitter on June 11, 2025, with a corresponding post on Newgrounds the following day. The internet meme was spurred by the release of Deltarune Deltarune Chapter 3 and Deltarune Chapter 4 on June 5th and the Deltarune theories called "Deer in the Headlights (Deltarune)", in which it is proposed that Asgore vehicular homicide Dess.<br><br>The GIF starts with Asgore in the Noelle's House (Deltarune) while smirking towards the camera. It then fades to Asgore driving down the road with a car mirror accessory reading "I ❤️ MY FAMILY" and a dashboard decoration of Kris (Deltarune) wearing a set of red horns. Dess is pictured walking out into the road, before turning around and running away from Asgore's truck. Dess then turns around and is struck by the truck, getting run over and crushed.</div>
