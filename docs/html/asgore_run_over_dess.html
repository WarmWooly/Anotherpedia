      <h1>Asgore Run over Dess</h1>
      <div>{{iAsgore Run over Dess}} is a GIF of the character Asgore as seen in Deltarune running over Dess with his truck, posted by Triki_Tr0y onto Twitter on June 11, 2025,<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/Triki_Tr0y/status/1932993606736097466(text=refCountref>> with a corresponding post on Newgrounds the following day.<<ref(content=link(text=refCountref>> The meme was spurred by the release of Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 on June 5th and the fan theory called "Deer in the Headlights", in which it is proposed that Asgore hit and killed Dess.&pThe GIF starts with Asgore in the Holiday's home while smirking towards the camera. It then fades to Asgore driving down the road with a car mirror accessory reading "I ❤️ MY FAMILY" and a dashboard decoration of Kris wearing a set of red horns. Dess is pictured walking out into the road, before turning around and running away from Asgore's truck. Dess then turns around and is struck by the truck, getting run over and crushed.</div>
