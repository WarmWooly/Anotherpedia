  <h1>Attack of the Roombas</h1>
  <div>{{b{{iAttack of the Roombas}}}}, or {{b{{iAotR}}}}, is a simple shoot 'em up by Warm_Wooly made in GameMaker, first being available on October 2021 on itch.io.<<ref(content=link|https://warm-wooly.itch.io/attack-of-the-roombas(text=refCountref>> The game follows the player (Attack of the Roombas), covered in mud, fending off various robot vacuum using rubber ball. The goal is to last as long as possible against the waves of Roombas.
The player spawns in an empty room, with Roombas slowly spawning around the room. The player must shoot at the Roombas to "clog" them, with each Roomba having a health bar. If the player comes into contact with a Roomba, they instantly lose. As the game progresses, new Roombas will have a chance to spawn based on the number of kills (with the exception of bosses, which only spawn once):<<table{{bEnemy}}|{{bKills}}|{{bType}}||Normal Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{rN/A}}|{{bNormal}}||Fast Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r10}}|{{bNormal}}||Slow Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r20}}|{{bNormal}}||Speed Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r30}}|{{bBoss}}||Factory Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r40}}|{{bNormal}}||Tank Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r50}}|{{bBoss}}||Cannon Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r60}}|{{bNormal}}||Healer Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r75}}|{{bBoss}}||Trapper Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r85}}|{{bNormal}}||Final Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)|{{r100}}|{{bBoss}}table>>&spAdditionally, Roombas will become stronger over time. Boss Roombas do not get stat increases. Every time a Roomba spawns, its base stats will change as shown in this table:<<table{{bEffect}}|{{bChance}}|{{bBase}}|{{bLimit}}||Decrease spawn rate by 1.5 sec|{{r53.33%}}|180 sec|60 sec||Increase base speed by 10%|{{r26.67%}}|100% speed|300% speed||Decreased base size 1%|{{r13.33%}}|100% size|80% size||Increase base HP by 1|{{r6.67%}}|3 HP|10 HPtable>>&spTo contrast the increasing strength of the Roombas, the player will also get buffed over time. For every 5 kills, the player gains 2 more ammo per reload and will have a reduced cooldown time. The player will also get the following buffs based on defeating bosses:<<table{{bBoss defeated}}|{{bEffect}}||Speed Boss|Increase camera view; increase movement speed||Tank Boss|Decrease reload time||Healer Boss|Increase camera view; increase movement speed; decrease reload time||Final Boss|Decrease reload timetable>>&spKills and score are two different metrics to track gameplay. Kills tracks every kill by the player (not including Minion Roomba (Attack of the Roombas) and Trap Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)) when a Roomba is defeated, while score increases for every rubber ball that hits a Roomba. Score, unlike kills, does not change gameplay over time.</div>
