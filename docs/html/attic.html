Attics are most often used as a [[storage room]] in a home, especially with their [[awkward]] forms caused by the [[walls|wall]] following the angle of the roof. Attics are also used for [[insulation]], [[air insulation]], or with enough furnishing, as an additional living space (i.e. [[guest bedroom]], [[play room]], or [[man cave]]).
