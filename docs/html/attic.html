      <h1>Attic</h1>
      <div>An attic is a room directly under the roof of a house or building. Attics are most often used as a storage room in a home, especially with their awkward forms caused by the walls following the angle of the roof. Attics are also used for insulation, air insulation, or with enough furnishing, as an additional living space (i.e. guest bedroom, play room, or man cave). Rafters used to support the roof are often visible and contribute to the "attic aesthetic".</div>
