      <h1>Attractive Leather Padding (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Attractive leather padding is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail as an upgrade to the leather padding (Not Lazy Chainmail). Attractive leather padding is used to upgrade chainmail armor (Not Lazy Chainmail) or shield (Minecraft) in a leathersmithing table (Not Lazy Chainmail), giving +0.5 Attraction. Attraction allows the player to pick up items further while sneaking (Minecraft).



Attractive leather padding can be melded in a Melder (Not Lazy Chainmail) using 1 leather padding (Not Lazy Chainmail) and 1 telemagnetic alloy (Not Lazy Chainmail).

Expert-level leatherworker (Minecraft) have a 50% chance to trade 1 leather padding (Not Lazy Chainmail) and 6 emerald (Minecraft) for 1 attractive leather padding.



In a leathersmithing table (Not Lazy Chainmail), attractive leather padding can be applied to chainmail armor (Not Lazy Chainmail) or shield (Minecraft). Each attractive leather padding adds +0.5 Attraction, with a full set of armor with 12 attractive leather paddings giving +6 Attraction. Shields will only add Attraction when held in the main hand (Minecraft) or offhand (Minecraft).

While sneaking (Minecraft) with Attraction, items within a cube radius of the player will be teleported to the player. The minimum distance for item attraction is 2.5 blocks. To calculate the range, do 2 + x, where x is the total Attractive amount on a player. The maximum radius of attraction, without a shield, is 8 blocks. With a shield, it is 9.5 blocks.
