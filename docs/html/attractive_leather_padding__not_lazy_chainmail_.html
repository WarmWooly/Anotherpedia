      <h1>Attractive Leather Padding (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Attractive leather padding is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail as an upgrade to the leather padding. Attractive leather padding is used to upgrade chainmail armor or shields in a leathersmithing table, giving +0.5 Attraction. Attraction allows the player to pick up items further while sneaking.



Attractive leather padding can be melded in a Melder using 1 leather padding and 1 telemagnetic alloy.

Expert-level leatherworkers have a 50% chance to trade 1 leather padding and 6 emeralds for 1 attractive leather padding.



In a leathersmithing table, attractive leather padding can be applied to chainmail armor or shields. Each attractive leather padding adds +0.5 Attraction, with a full set of armor with 12 attractive leather paddings giving +6 Attraction. Shields will only add Attraction when held in the main hand or offhand.

While sneaking with Attraction, items within a cube radius of the player will be teleported to the player. The minimum distance for item attraction is 2.5 blocks. To calculate the range, do 2 + x, where x is the total Attractive amount on a player. The maximum radius of attraction, without a shield, is 8 blocks. With a shield, it is 9.5 blocks.
