      <h1>Aura farming</h1>
      <div>Aura farming is Gen Alpha slang for doing spontaneous and charismatic actions to cultivate aura. The term is especially popular in short-form videos that take clips from anime (notably Dragon Ball Z) or real life that depict a person or character "aura farming" with background meme music and captions to ham up the action. Dances, poses, or utilizing rizz can be used to aura farm.</div>
