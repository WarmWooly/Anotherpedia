      <h1>Authorize Tool (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Authorize Tool is a primary tool within SCP: Devolved Revamp for the Research Department (SCP: Devolved Revamp) and the Administrative Branch (SCP: Devolved Revamp), used to authorize Class D (SCP: Devolved Revamp) to pass the red line in their containment room and do various tests around the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp). Authorizing a Class D player (roblox) allows them to cross the red line without being marked for termination. Both RD and AD can authorize CD, and a green checkmark will appear above the CD's head, as well as a green arrow line connecting the authorizer and the CD. If a CD that is authorized crosses the red line to the facility exit, they instantly lose their authorization and are marked for termination.</div>
