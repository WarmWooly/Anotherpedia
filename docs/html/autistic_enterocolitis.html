The paper itself does not specifically mention "autistic enterocolitis". Wakefield stated that he found that autistic enterocolitis was caused by the [[measles]] in the [[MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine|MMR vaccine]]. The current expert consensus is that the existence of [[enterocolitis]] linked with [[autism]] has "not been established".<<ref(content=link|https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/125/Supplement_1/S1/29786/Evaluation-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext(text=refCountref>></div>
