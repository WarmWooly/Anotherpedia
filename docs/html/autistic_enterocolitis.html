  <h1>Autistic enterocolitis</h1>
  <div>Autistic enterocolitis is the name of a pseudoscience gastrointestinal disease proposed by Andrew Wakefield after the now-retracted 1998 The Lancet paper titled "Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children". The paper itself does not specifically mention "autistic enterocolitis". Wakefield stated that he found that autistic enterocolitis was caused by the measles in the MMR vaccine. The current expert consensus is that the existence of enterocolitis linked with autism has "not been established".<<ref(content=link|https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/125/Supplement_1/S1/29786/Evaluation-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext(text=refCountref>></div>
