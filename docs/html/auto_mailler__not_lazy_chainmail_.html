The auto mailler can be crafted with 5 cobblestone, 1 wooden pressure plate, and 3 iron composite ingots (fill the bottom row with iron composite, the middle with the pressure plate, and the rest of the grid with cobblestone).
Auto maillers require an industrial belt to run, with better belts increasing the rate chains are added to the project. The auto mailler will complete the chainmail project that is inserted. Chain links are inserted into the left section, where they will be added to the project. If the right slot is full, the project will not be worked on. Projects partially completed can be taken from the auto mailler and manually completed, and vice versa. The chainmail project must be manually set to the desired output.
