      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|5.5||Hardness|5.5||Luminous|No||Transparent|No||Flammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The auto snipper is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to automatically snip coils and unfinished projects into chain links.
The auto snipper can be crafted with 5 cobblestone, 1 iron ingot, and 3 iron composite ingots (fill the bottom row with iron composite, the middle with iron, and the rest of the grid with cobblestone).
Auto snippers require an industrial belt to run, with better belts increasing the rate the auto snipper snips. Auto snippers also require a pair of pliers to run, with better pliers decreasing the snips needed per coil/unfinished project. Coils/unfinished projects are inserted into the left section, where they will be snipped. If the right slots are full, the coils/unfinished projects will not be snipped. Coils/unfinished projects partially snipped automatically can be taken from the auto snipper and manually snipped, and vice versa.
