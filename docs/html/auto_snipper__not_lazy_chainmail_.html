  <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|5.5||hardness (Minecraft)|5.5||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The auto snipper is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to automatically snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) coils (Not Lazy Chainmail) and unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail) into chain links (Not Lazy Chainmail).
The auto snipper can be crafting (Minecraft) with 5 cobblestone (Minecraft), 1 iron ingot (Minecraft), and 3 iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail) (fill the bottom row with iron composite, the middle with iron, and the rest of the grid with cobblestone).
Auto snippers require an industrial belts (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better belts increasing the rate the auto snipper snips. Auto snippers also require a pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better pliers decreasing the snips needed per coil/unfinished project. Coils/unfinished projects are inserted into the left section, where they will be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail). If the right slots are full, the coils/unfinished projects will not be snipped. Coils/unfinished projects partially snipped automatically can be taken from the auto snipper and manually snipped, and vice versa.
