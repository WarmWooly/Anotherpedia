      <h1>Auto Winder (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Pickaxe preferred)||Blast resistance|10||Hardness|2.5||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The auto winder is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to turn wires and spools into coils automatically.



The auto winder can be crafted with 2 cobblestone, 4 iron composite ingots, and 2 empty spools (fill the bottom row with iron composite, the left and right slots with cobblestone, the top corners with empty spools, and the top slot with iron composite).



For an in-depth guide to winding, see Winding Jig ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}<br>Auto winders require an industrial belt to run, with better belts decreasing the time it takes to wind. Wires and spools can be wound by right-clicking an auto winder with an industrial belt while holding the wire/spool. When a player manually winds a wire or spool, they will be awarded the advancement Back in My Day.

Wires or spools can be inserted into the left section to automatically be wound. When a wire or spool is fully wound, it will create coils of its corresponding material. A wire will create one coil, while a spool will create 10 coils and an empty spool to be reused. These drops will be inserted into the right section. If there is not enough space to deposit coils, the wire or spool will not be wound. If there is not enough space to wind a spool, but there is space for a wire, then the wire will be wound. Wires and spools taken out mid-winding can be continued to be manually wound, and vice versa. The auto winder will wind wires and spools faster/slower depending on their material and the belt used as if it were being manually wound.
