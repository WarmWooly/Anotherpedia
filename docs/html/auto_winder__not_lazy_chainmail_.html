  <h1>Auto Winder (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Pickaxe (minecraft) preferred)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|10||hardness (Minecraft)|2.5||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|Yes||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The auto winder is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to turn wires (Not Lazy Chainmail) and spools (Not Lazy Chainmail) into coils (Not Lazy Chainmail) automatically.
The auto winder can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 cobblestone (Minecraft), 4 iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 2 empty spool (Not Lazy Chainmail) (fill the bottom row with iron composite, the left and right slots with cobblestone, the top corners with empty spools, and the top slot with iron composite).
For an in-depth guide to winding, see Winding Jig ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}&spAuto winders require an industrial belts (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better belts decreasing the time it takes to wind. Wires (Not Lazy Chainmail) and spools (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be wound by right-clicking an auto winder with an industrial belt while holding the wire/spool. When a player manually winds a wire or spool, they will be awarded the advancement (Minecraft) Back in My Day (Not Lazy Chainmail).
Wires or spools can be inserted into the left section to automatically be wound. When a wire or spool is fully wound, it will create coils of its corresponding material. A wire will create one coil, while a spool will create 10 coils and an empty spool (Not Lazy Chainmail) to be reused. These drops will be inserted into the right section. If there is not enough space to deposit coils, the wire or spool will not be wound. If there is not enough space to wind a spool, but there is space for a wire, then the wire will be wound. Wires and spools taken out mid-winding can be continued to be manually wound, and vice versa. The auto winder will wind wires and spools faster/slower depending on their material and the belt used as if it were being manually wound.
