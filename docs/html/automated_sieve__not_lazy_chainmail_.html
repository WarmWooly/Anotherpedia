      <h1>Automated sieve (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div>The automated sieve is an automatic farm (Minecraft) to gather item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft modding (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail through cobblestone generator (Not Lazy Chainmail) blocks to be sieving (Not Lazy Chainmail) into various resources. Automated sieves can be built anywhere and are easy to expand to increase the quantity of drops and drop variety.

An automated sieve requires the following basic components:;;Cobblestone Generator (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Generates the raw materials for sieving.|Chain Conveyors (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Transports items through the droppers.|Hopper Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Drops items from the Cobblestone Generator onto the Chain Conveyors.|Sieve Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Converts the raw materials into valuable resources.|Sort Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Drops wanted items into storage and disposes unwanted items.|Barrel Collector (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Stores wanted items.|Garbage Disposal (Not Lazy Chainmail) -- Destroys unwanted items.;;While not every component is needed (such as the Garbage Disposal), it is recommended for the standard setup of an automatic sieve.

The basic tower design takes up a 2x2x8 (length/width/height) space and requires the following resources:<<tableBlock|Count||Any building block|r5||Barrel Collector (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Chain Conveyor (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r8||Cobblefiers (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Cobblestone Generator (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Garbage Disposal (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Hopper Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Industrial Belts (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Sieve Meshes (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Sieve Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Sort Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2table>><br>Starting from the top (8 blocks from the ground), place the Cobblestone Generator and insert an Industrial Belt and a Cobblefier. The quality of the belt will determine the rate which items are produced from the generator, while the Cobblefier determines the resource generated. Directly below it, place a Hopper Dropper to extract items from the Cobblestone Generator. Below that, create a 2x2 square of Chain Conveyors in a circle on top of 3 building blocks and a Sieve Dropper. The level of the Sieve used will determine the types of items dropped from the farm. Below that, create another 2x2 circle of Chain Conveyors on top of 2 building blocks and 2 Sort Droppers. Fill the Sort Droppers with the items that you want to collect, ensuring that one is set to "Whitelist" while the other is set to "Blacklist". Two blocks under the "Whitelist" Sort Dropper, place the Barrel Collector, and under the "Blacklist" Sort Dropper, place the Garbage Disposal.

The best improvement that can be made to the farm is using Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail) on the Industrial Belt and the Sieve to prevent them from breaking over time. While faster Chain Conveyors can help sieve and sort through items faster, going too fast can cause items to be flung out of the system without barriers. Adding more Cobblestone Generators and using an Iron Composite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) in them will increase the number of items to be processed, thus increasing the drops. While better Sieves generally give more drops, certain items can only be collected by sieving an item at a specific tier (such as using a Rose Gold Sieve (Not Lazy Chainmail) on Dirt (Minecraft) to get Pumpkin Seeds (Minecraft)). An Expanded Barrel Collector (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be used to hold more items than a standard Barrel Collector, or items can be transferred away from the automated sieve into a sorted storage system (Minecraft). A Machine Muffler (Not Lazy Chainmail) or Machine Dampener (Not Lazy Chainmail) is greatly recommended to silence or reduce the noise of the machines used in the automated sieve.</div>
