  <h1>Axle ({{iTUNNELER}})</h1>
  <div><<shortCompanion robot in {{iTUNNELER}}short>><<img(src=git/axle tunneler.png(cap=Axle.img>>{{bAxle}} is a [[robotic|robot]] [[companion]] [[character]] within the [[Roblox]] game {{i[[TUNNELER|TUNNELER (game)]]}} from the start of the game. He was created by [[Ecliptic Industries|Ecliptic Industries (TUNNELER)]] and is assigned to follow and record the player through the testing chambers. He introduces new mechanics, comments on the player's performance, and occasionally makes [[small talk]]. He is also shown to worry for the player's safety, especially when [[turrets|turret (TUNNELER)]] that can kill the player are introduced. Axle is shown to know that he is a creation by Ecliptic Industries, but he doesn't fully understand all the features implemented into him (such as [[blinking]]). He is often compared to the character [[Wheatley|Wheatly (Portal)]] from {{i[[Portal 2]]}} due to the similar core design and movement limitations.<<hrAppearancehr>>Axle is a round metal machine attached to a [[gantry]] that spans across levels. Axle has a large rotating [[axle]] that is connected to the gantry, which can also rotate, giving Axle the ability to turn and look up and down. The bar on the left of Axle's front side measures volume, starting from red (bottom), to yellow (middle), and lastly green (top). His face is a green [[screen]] with a simple face comprised of lines, which he uses to make [[expressions|facial expression]] and to play {{i[[Pong]]}}.</div>
