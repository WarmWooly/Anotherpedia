      <h1>Ayds</h1>
      <div>Ayds was an anoretic candy manufactured by The Carlay Company used to reduce weight, where it was trademarked in 1946, stating that it was being sold and distributed nine years prior.<br><br>It's name is Ayds Reducing Plan Candy, and sold under the flavors chocolate, chocolate mint, butterscotch, caramel, and peanut butter. The original active ingredient was benzocaine, which was later changed to phenylpropanolamine.

In the 1980s, a virus called AIDS was starting to spread in the American population. Ayds, which sounds like AIDS, had an unfortunate name due to the sudden circumstances. Despite this, and possibly because of this, the sales of Ayds increased over the mid-1980s. Later, in 1988, after Ayds was sold off, it was discontinued due to a sharp decline in sales because of the similarity to AIDS.</div>
