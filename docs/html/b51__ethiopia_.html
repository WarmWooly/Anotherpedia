      <h1>B51 (Ethiopia)</h1>
      <div>The B51 is a highway in Ethiopia that spans between Soddo and Alem Gena over 190 mi (300 km) in length.

B51 is connected to multiple roads in Soddo, mainly A7, which it is connected using a roundabout. Going north, B51 passes many homes and churches while intertwining with many smaller roads. It then cuts through the middle of Areka before passing east of Bottego. B51 then passes between Hadero to the east and Shinshicho and Angecha to the west. It then continues northward, going into Doyo Gena, making a sharp curve from west to east through Hosania, before going through Fonko and Kerate. It then passes through Worabe, then Alkeso, and then Silti, and then Kibet (with Keber slightly northwest), and then Butajira, and then Kela 11, and then Bu-i, with Kondaltiti and Suten following. After, B51 goes through Tiya, Haro, Lemen, over the Awash River, then through Melka Kunture, Rebto, until finally entering Alma Gena, where it connects into A5.</div>
