  <h1>B51 (Ethiopia)</h1>
  <div>The B51 is a highway in Ethiopia that spans between Soddo, Ethiopia and Alem Gena, Ethiopia over 190 mile (300 kilometer) in length.
B51 is connected to multiple roads in Soddo, mainly A7 (Ethiopia), which it is connected using a roundabout. Going north, B51 passes many home and church while intertwining with many smaller roads. It then cuts through the middle of Areka, Ethiopia before passing east of Bottego, Ethiopia. B51 then passes between Hadero, Ethiopia to the east and Shinshicho, Ethiopia and Angecha, Ethiopia to the west. It then continues northward, going into Doyo Gena, Ethiopia, making a sharp curve from west to east through Hosania, Ethiopia, before going through Fonko, Ethiopia and Kerate, Ethiopia. It then passes through Worabe, Ethiopia, then Alkeso, Ethiopia, and then Silti, Ethiopia, and then Kibet, Ethiopia (with Keber, Ethiopia slightly northwest), and then Butajira, Ethiopia, and then Kela 11, Ethiopia, and then Bu-i, Ethiopia, with Kondaltiti, Ethiopia and Suten, Ethiopia following. After, B51 goes through Tiya, Ethiopia, Haro, Ethiopia, Lemen, Ethiopia, over the Awash River, then through Melka Kunture, Ethiopia, Rebto, Ethiopia, until finally entering Alma Gena, where it connects into A5 (Ethiopia).</div>
