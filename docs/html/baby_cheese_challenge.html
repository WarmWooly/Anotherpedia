      <h1>Baby Cheese Challenge</h1>
      <div>The Baby Cheese Challenge, also called the Throw Cheese on Crying Baby Challenge and the "Cheese-slice trick", was a viral challenge where the parent would throw a slice of cheese (typically American Kraft Singles) onto the face or forehead of a crying baby in an attempt to cease the crying. If the baby stopped crying, it would be considered a success.<br><br>The reason that throwing a slice of cheese onto a baby makes them stop crying is most likely because of sudden confusion brought on by the action. It is not considered a good idea to throw cheese on a baby and record it because it pushes the feelings of the baby aside, where the baby is likely still confused and upset after the video has ended. It also uses a baby as a prop for internet clout, which may be considered to be unethical.</div>
