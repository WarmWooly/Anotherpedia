      <h1>Backroll (scuba diving)</h1>
      <div>A backroll is an action performed by Scuba Diver to enter the water. This is done to reduce the tilting of small Boat as a scuba diver exits. To do a backroll, the diver Sitting on the gunwale or pontoon, lowers their chin, and then leans backward as they tuck their legs in.<br><br>There is a internet meme that explains why divers perform a backroll:Do you know why scuba divers roll backward out of the boat? Because if they rolled forward, they'd just fall in the boat!</div>
