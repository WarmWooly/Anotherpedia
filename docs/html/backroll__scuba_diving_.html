      <div>A backroll is an action performed by scuba divers to enter the water. This is done to reduce the tilting of small boats as a scuba diver exits. To do a backroll, the diver sits on the gunwale or pontoon, lowers their chin, and then leans backward as they tuck their legs in.&pThere is a meme that explains why divers perform a backroll:</div>
