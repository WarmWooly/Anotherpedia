  <h1>Backscratcher</h1>
  <div>A backscratcher (also written as back scratcher) is a tool used to reach itch on the human body, especially along the human back, that would be inaccessible by hands. A backscratcher tends to be a pole or rod with an end that has several contact points to scratch an itch. Backscratchers are made of various material, including wood, metal, and plastic.</div>
