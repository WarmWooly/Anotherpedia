      <h1>Backscratcher</h1>
      <div>A backscratcher (also written as back scratcher) is a tool used to reach itches on the body, especially along the back, that would be inaccessible by hands. A backscratcher tends to be a pole or rod with an end that has several contact points to scratch an itch. Backscratchers are made of various materials, including wood, metal, and plastic.</div>
