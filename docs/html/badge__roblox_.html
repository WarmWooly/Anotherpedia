Badges can serve many purposes, including welcoming the user while giving them a badge to remind them of the game, to mark a significant user achievement, or to give a [[goal]] to work towards when fully completing an experience. Badges can be removed from the user's profile at will. Badges can also be collected en masse through user-made [[badge walks|badge walk (Roblox)]].&pOnly one badge can be given to each user, and users must be within the experience to earn a badge. There is an additional [[rate limit|rate limiting]] on the total number of badges that can be earned per minute. Users can create up to 5 badges for their experience per day for free, with additional badges purchased for 100 [[Robux]] per badge.<<hrRarityhr>>Badges have a built-in statistic to measure their difficulty based on the [[ratio]] of users who join an experience and can obtain the badge, with badges that are easier to obtain being less rare. Badges that are given to most users, such as a welcome badge, will be very common compared to a badge that requires sigifigant time or skill investment in the experience.<<table{{bRarity}}|{{bPercentage}}||Freebie|100%--90%||Cake Walk|89.9%--80%||Easy|79.9%--50%||Moderate|49.9%--30%||Challenging|29.9%--20%||Hard|19.9%--10%||Extreme|9.9%--5%||Insane|4.9%--1%||Impossible|0.9%--0%table>></div>
