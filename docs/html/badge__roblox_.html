      <h1>Badge (Roblox)</h1>
      <div>For official badges given by Roblox, see Roblox badges.&spA badge (also called a user badge or player badge) is an item (Roblox) given to a user (Roblox) from an experience (Roblox) which was created by another user for completing a pre-determined criteria. Badges can serve many purposes, including welcoming the user while giving them a badge to remind them of the game, to mark a significant user achievement, or to give a goal to work towards when fully completing an experience. Badges can be removed from the user's profile at will. Badges can also be collected en masse through user-made badge walk (Roblox).&pOnly one badge can be given to each user, and users must be within the experience to earn a badge. There is an additional rate limiting on the total number of badges that can be earned per minute. Users can create up to 5 badges for their experience per day for free, with additional badges purchased for 100 Robux per badge.
Badges have a built-in statistic to measure their difficulty based on the ratio of users who join an experience and can obtain the badge, with badges that are easier to obtain being less rare. Badges that are given to most users, such as a welcome badge, will be very common compared to a badge that requires sigifigant time or skill investment in the experience.<<tableRarity|Percentage||Freebie|100%--90%||Cake Walk|89.9%--80%||Easy|79.9%--50%||Moderate|49.9%--30%||Challenging|29.9%--20%||Hard|19.9%--10%||Extreme|9.9%--5%||Insane|4.9%--1%||Impossible|0.9%--0%table>></div>
