  <div><<short2024 poker-inspired rougelike deckbuildershort>>{{tFor the [[profession]], see [[Balatro (profession)]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/balatro logo.jpg(cap=The [[logo]] for {{iBalatro}}.img>>{{b{{iBalatro}}}} is a [[single-player|single-player video game]] [[poker]]-inspired [[rougelike deckbuilder]] [[developed|game development]] by [[LocalThunk]] and [[published|game publishing]] by [[Playstack]], [[realeased|game release]] on February 20, 2024. {{iBalatro}} consists of a simple [[game loop]] where players go through [[rounds|round (Balatro)]] (known as [[Blinds|Blind (Balatro)]]), racking up [[chips|chips (Balatro)]] via [[poker hands|poker hands (Balatro)]] to earn [[money|money (Balatro)]] before going to [[the Shop|The Shop (Balatro)]] to buy [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]] and other purchasable items to aid in the next Blind. {{iBalatro}}'s [[music|video game music]] was [[composed|music composition]] by [[LouisF]]. {{iBalatro}} was made using the [[game engine]] [[Löve|Löve (game engine)]] and is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[5|PlayStation 5]], [[XBox One]], [[S|XBox Series S]] and [[X|XBox Series X]], [[Google Play]], and the [[App Store|Apple App Store]].<<hrGameplayhr>><<vid(src=git/balatro gameplay.mp4(cap=Gameplay of {{iBalatro}}.vid>>The core component of the game is using poker hands to get enough chips to pass Blinds. Each Blind increases in difficulty, getting much harder per [[Ante|Ante (Balatro)]]. The [[goal]] is to complete as many Antes as possible in a [[run|run (Balatro)]], with each Ante comprised of 3 Blinds: the [[Small Blind|Small Blind (Balatro)]], the [[Big Blind|Big Blind (Balatro)]], and the [[Boss Blind|Boss Blind (Balatro)]]. Every 8th Ante (Ante 8, 16, 24...) has a [[Finisher Boss Blind|Finisher Boss Blind (Balatro)]], being much harder compared to other Boss Blinds.<<hr2Roundshr2>><<img(src=git/balatro two pair.jpg(cap=A [[two pair|two pair (poker)]] being played.img>><<img(src=git/balatro.png(cap=A [[straight flush|straight flush (poker)]] being played.img>>The player will draw their [[hand size|hand size (Balatro)]] when starting the round from their [[deck|deck (Balatro)]] and will be able to select up to five [[cards|playing cards (Balatro)]] to either play in a [[hand|hand (Balatro)]] or [[discard|discard (Balatro)]]. Players will have a limited number of hands and discards, and they will lose the round (and the entire run) if they run out of hands (or run out of cards in the deck) before they reach the necessary number of chips to defeat the Blind. Players will earn money by defeating a Blind, alongside earning bonus cash based on their number of unused hands and other bonuses awarded through Jokers or other items before going to the Shop.&pPlayers will get [[chips|chips (Balatro)]] and a [[multiplier|multiplier (Balatro)]] per poker hand they play, which determines the total number of chips they will score. Better poker hands will increase the base chips and multiplier they will earn, with higher-valued cards adding to the chips before the hand is calculated. [[Card Enhancements|Enhancements (Balatro)]], [[Editions|Editions (Balatro)]], and [[Seals|Seals (Balatro)]] can increase the number of chips or multipliers earned by played cards. [[Planet Cards|Planet Cards (Balatro)]] are single-use cards that can increase the level of a hand, which adds to the base chips and multiplier of the hand played. [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]] are most used for increasing the chips and multiplier of a hand. Some Jokers may increase the chips or multiplier based on the [[Suit|Suit (Balatro)]] or [[Rank|Rank (Balatro)]] of the cards in the hand, the type of poker hand played, the number of times the poker hand has been played, the number of cards used, among many others. Some Jokers and card effects may multiply the multiplier, greatly increasing the number of chips earned.&pSmall and Big Blinds can be skipped, where the player will not earn money from the Blind or go to the Shop, but they will get a [[Tag|Tags (Balatro)]]. These Tags will allow the player to get a variety of possible benefits, such as a guaranteed Joker [[rarity|Joker rarity (Balatro)]] or [[Edition|Edition (Balatro)]] in the Shop, a free [[booster pack|booster packs (Balatro)]], increased hand size the following round, and earning extra money. Big Blinds are 1.5x larger than Small Blinds.&pWhile Small and Big Blinds have no effects, the Boss Blind has a unique effect that increases the difficulty. These Boss Blinds can be rerolled and even disabled using specific items, but they cannot be skipped. Boss Blinds can have a variety of restrictions, such as only allowing one type of poker hand to be played, only playing a single hand, losing money per card played, drawing cards face-down (hiding what they are to the player), decreasing hand size, [[debuffing|debuff (Balatro)]] specific cards (such as all cards of a specific Suit), and discarding cards from the hand. Finisher Boss Blinds are much harder, putting a player's strategy to the test. They may require the player to sell a Joker, disable a random Joker, earn much more chips than normal, shuffle and hide all Jokers, or keep a random card selected when playing hands or discarding.<<hr2The Shophr2>><<img(src=git/balatro shop.png(cap=The Shop.img>>[[The Shop|The Shop (Balatro)]] is another major part of the game, where the player can buy [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]], [[Tarot Cards|Tarot Cards (Balatro)]], [[Planet Cards|Planet Cards (Balatro)]], [[Spectral Cards|Spectral Cards (Balatro)]], [[playing cards|playing cards (Balatro)]], [[booster packs|booster packs (Balatro)]], and [[Vouchers|Vouchers (Balatro)]].&pJokers, and more rarely Tarot and Planet Cards, can be purchased from a rerollable shop area to be added and used for the upcoming rounds. Rerolling costs money, but the cost can be offset using [[Tags|Tags (Balatro)]] and Vouchers. There are normally only two slots, but more can be added using Vouchers. Vouchers can also be used to influence how often Tarot and Planet Cards are shown in the Shop and even add cards to be available to be purchased.&pBooster packs can be purchased and used to select one to two out of multiple random options for Jokers, Tarot Cards, Planet Cards, Spectral Cards, and playing cards. There are two booster packs available in the Shop after every round. When purchased, a booster pack will immediately open. If none of the options in a booster pack are satisfactory, they can be skipped. Tarot, Planet, and Spectral Cards must be used if selected, with Tarot and Spectral Cards showing a large array of random cards from the deck to be selected and used (such as using [[The Star|The Star (Balatro)]] to turn three of the cards into &diamondSuit Diamonds).&pVouchers are used to greatly benefit the player at a high monetary cost, with one available per Ante (can be influenced by Tags). Vouchers have a variety of uses, such as increasing the number of available cards in the Shop, decreasing the cost of items in the Shop, decreasing the cost of rerolling the Shop, increasing hands, discards, and hand size, and changing which cards can appear in the Shop.</div>
