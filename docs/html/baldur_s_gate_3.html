The player, who can be joined by a variety of companions (who are also infected), goes on a quest to remove it from themselves, leading through the campaign (Dungeons & Dragons) set up in Baldur's Gate 3. This includes various combat (Baldur's Gate 3) encounters, conversation (Baldur's Gate 3), exploration in Baldur's Gate 3, and other interactions with Non-player character that changes the path the player will progress on based on their actions in-game.
