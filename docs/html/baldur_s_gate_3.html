      <div>{{iBaldur's Gate 3}} is a 2023 Dungeons & Dragons-based RPG developed by Larian Studios as the third game in the Baldur's Gate series. The story involves the player, either as a preset origin character or a custom character, waking up on a flying mind flayers ship infected with a tadpole that threatens to turn the player into a mind flayer aswell. The player, who can be joined by a variety of companions (who are also infected), goes on a quest to remove it from themselves, leading through the campaign set up in Baldur's Gate 3. This includes various combat encounters, conversations, exploration, and other interactions with NPCs that changes the path the player will progress on based on their actions in-game. Baldur's Gate 3 can both be played alone and with up to three other people in the multiplayer mode. Baldur's Gate 3 has been considered to be among the greatest video games, which follows similar critical acclaim of its predecessors Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.</div>
