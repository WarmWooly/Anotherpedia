The main challenge comes from the player avoiding getting stuck on their way down to the [[finish line|finish line (Happy Wheels)]] placed on the bottom. Sharp triangles used as spikes, [[spike sets|spike set (Happy Wheels)]] along the walls, and other obstacles can also be added for difficulty. The balls and other obstacles are often put as separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses.&p[[Segway Guy|Segway Guy (Happy Wheels)]] is the most used [[character|characters (Happy Wheel)]] used for Ball Falls, with most forcing Segway Guy off his segway to allow him to squeeze between obstacles. Rapidly pressing movement buttons can be used to shimmy through tighter gaps, but there are some cases where the character becomes stuck, requiring the player to restart the level. Grabbing onto balls can aid in orienting the character through obstacles. Triangle spikes, the most used lethal obstacle, can easily take off limbs, behead, or even explode the character, increasing the precision required to get to the bottom.</div>
