  <h1>Ball lightning</h1>
  <div>For the {{aiMagic: The Gathering card, see Ball Lightning (aiMagic: The Gathering).}}&spBall lightning is a rare phenomenon of a bright ball forming between a few inch to multiple meter where the cause is not fully unknown. It can range in color, from yellow, orange, red, or blue, giving off an odor and occasionally melting nearby objects, but is relatively harmless. After a few second, the ball either dissipates or explosion. The phenomenon is most common during thunderstorm. Ball lightning seems to take two forms: as a large ball of lightning in the sky, and as a small ball that floats above the ground and zips around. The second form has many witness to the event, but no real footage has been made of it. 
Main page: Ball lightning caught on video near railways&spOn May 27th, 2019, Andrei Trukhonovets created a YouTube video of what seemed to be a ball of lightning traveling across train track, which was also posted onto Instagram, which was labeled as CGI. This video was spread by Cambio Digital on Facebook as if it were a real phenomenon. Andrei has pushed back against Cambio Digital and has attempted to clarify that the video is fake.</div>
