Ball lightning seems to take two forms: as a large ball of lightning in the sky, and as a small ball that floats above the ground and zips around. The second form has many [[witnesses|witness]] to the event, but no real footage has been made of it. <<hrFaked footagehr>>{{tMain page: [[Ball lightning caught on video near railways]]}}&sp<<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IwR14D3NA8c(cap=The original video by Andrei.yt>>On May 27th, 2019, [[Andrei Trukhonovets]] created a [[YouTube]] [[video]] of what seemed to be a ball of lightning traveling across [[train tracks|train track]], which was also posted onto [[Instagram]], which was labeled as [[CGI]].
