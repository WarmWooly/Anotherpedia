      <h1>Banana peel</h1>
      <div>A banana peel, or banana skin, is the peel of the banana. The peel is almost exclusively removed from the banana before consumption of the softer innards and is discarded as waste. Banana peels can be composting, fed to livestock, as an ingredient in a food dish, and other small-scale uses. Banana peels, with a coefficient of friction on linoleum of 0.07 makes them extremely slippery, especially when stepped on. Slipping on a banana peel is a classic slapstick gag of a person slipping on a banana peel left on the ground.</div>
