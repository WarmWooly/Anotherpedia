      <h1>Bar chart</h1>
      <div>A bar chart, bar graph, or column chart is a chart that displays data in the form of bar, with the size of the bar showing the proportional value of what they represent. Bar charts can be horizontal or vertical, with one axis that displays what is being quantified, and the other used to show the values represented by the bars. Some bar charts may be clustered, where they have multiple bars under different categories per element, which are generally color code. They may also be stacked, where multiple sources contribute to a whole bar and are colored depending on the source.</div>
