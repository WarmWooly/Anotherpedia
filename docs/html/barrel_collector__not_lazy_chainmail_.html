      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Axe (Minecraft) preferred)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|3||hardness (Minecraft)|1||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The barrel collector is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to automatically store item (Minecraft) that land above it.



The barrel collector can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 rose gold chain (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 barrel (Minecraft), and 1 hopper (Minecraft) (place the chains to the left and right of the barrel, then place the hopper above).



When an item (Minecraft entity) lands above the barrel collector, it will automatically store the dropped item inside itself. The barrel collector has 27 slots to store items within, the same as a barrel (Minecraft). The barrel collector can be opened with right-click, even with the top covered.

The barrel collector is used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Expanded Barrel Collector (Not Lazy Chainmail) - 2 barrel collectors and 1 block of iron composite chains (Minecraft) (place the barrels to the left and right of the chains).

In a furnace (Minecraft), blast furnace (Minecraft), or smoker (Minecraft), 1 barrel collector can fuel for 15 second (1.5 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (Minecraft) (64 barrel collectors, 960 seconds, 96 items).</div>
