The barrel collector can be crafted with 2 rose gold chains, 1 barrel, and 1 hopper (place the chains to the left and right of the barrel, then place the hopper above).
When an item lands above the barrel collector, it will automatically store the dropped item inside itself. The barrel collector has 27 slots to store items within, the same as a barrel. The barrel collector can be opened with right-click, even with the top covered.
The barrel collector is used in the following crafting recipes:&spExpanded Barrel Collector - 2 barrel collectors and 1 block of iron composite chains (place the barrels to the left and right of the chains).
