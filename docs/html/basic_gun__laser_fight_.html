With a mediocre fire rate and no special effect, the Basic Gun is the most rudimentary gun to use and is often swapped out with other, more advanced options. The Rapid-Fire Gun is a direct upgrade to the Basic Gun. When spawning in the modes Normal, Gun Rain, Infinite Stamina, Trigger Happy, or Armed To The Teeth, the player spawns in with a Basic Gun. Players start with the Basic Gun in the mode Arsenal and can obtain the Basic Gun in all modes.

The following messages appear when a player is killed with the Basic Gun:;;X was shot by Y using Basic Gun|X was destroyed by Y using Basic Gun|X was shot by the worst gun in the game by Y using Basic Gun|X was oofed by Y using Basic Gun|X was rekt by Y using Basic Gun|X was tagged by Y using Basic Gun|X was zapped by Y using Basic Gun|X was killed by Y using Basic Gun;;</div>
