The Rapid-Fire Gun (Laser Fight) is a direct upgrade to the Basic Gun. When spawning in the mode (Laser Fight) Normal (Laser Fight), Gun Rain (Laser Fight), Infinite Stamina (Laser Fight), Trigger Happy (Laser Fight), or Armed To The Teeth (Laser Fight), the player spawns in with a Basic Gun. Players start with the Basic Gun in the mode Arsenal (Laser Fight) and can obtain the Basic Gun in all modes.
