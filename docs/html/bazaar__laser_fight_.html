      <h1>Bazaar (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Bazaar is a large outdoor map in Laser Fight loosely based on bazaar maps in other FPS games. Players spawn in one of the four corners of the map with a small colored pedestal. The ground level is filled with barriers and structures, with small openings to buildings that can be slid into and out of. Buildings can be used as a way to ambush opponents, escape from danger, or fight in a closed space. Metal bridges above the ground are used as an elevated position to navigate across the map and get to a vantage point. Some of the metal bridges are broken, creating gaps the player can dive or wallrun across, with a few openings from the metal bridges leading inside buildings. Planks and thin wires connect the roofs of the buildings, creating a large, open area to navigate and cross at the cost of being exposed to enemy fire. A small room only connected by a wire can be entered for the badge Wire You Here?</div>
