  <h1>Bazaar (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bBazaar}} is a large outdoor map (Laser Fight) in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox Game)}} loosely based on bazaar maps in other First person shooter. Players spawn in one of the four corners of the map with a small colored pedestal. The ground level is filled with barriers and structures, with small openings to buildings that can be slide (Laser Fight) into and out of. Buildings can be used as a way to ambush opponents, escape from danger, or fight in a closed space. Metal bridges above the ground are used as an elevated position to navigate across the map and get to a vantage point. Some of the metal bridges are broken, creating gaps the player can dive (Laser Fight) or wallrun (Laser Fight) across, with a few openings from the metal bridges leading inside buildings. Planks and thin wires connect the roofs of the buildings, creating a large, open area to navigate and cross at the cost of being exposed to enemy fire. A small room only connected by a wire can be entered for the badge (Roblox) Wire You Here? (Laser Fight)</div>
