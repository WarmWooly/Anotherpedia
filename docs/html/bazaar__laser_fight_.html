  <h1>Bazaar ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortDesert market map in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/bazaar laser fight.png(cap=The map Bazaar.img>>{{bBazaar}} is a large outdoor [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox Game)]]}} loosely based on bazaar maps in other [[FPS games|First person shooter]]. Players spawn in one of the four corners of the map with a small colored pedestal. The ground level is filled with barriers and structures, with small openings to buildings that can be [[slid|slide (Laser Fight)]] into and out of. Buildings can be used as a way to ambush opponents, escape from danger, or fight in a closed space. Metal bridges above the ground are used as an elevated position to navigate across the map and get to a vantage point. Some of the metal bridges are broken, creating gaps the player can [[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]] or [[wallrun|wallrun (Laser Fight)]] across, with a few openings from the metal bridges leading inside buildings. Planks and thin wires connect the roofs of the buildings, creating a large, open area to navigate and cross at the cost of being exposed to enemy fire. A small room only connected by a wire can be entered for the [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[Wire You Here?|Wire You Here? (Laser Fight)]]</div>
