      <h1>Beanium Lab</h1>
      <div>The Beanium Lab is a high school chemistry lab experiment where the students discover a fictional element "Beanium" (sometimes called "Legumium") where they must find the different isotopes for the beans.

There are 3-4 different beans of differing colors (ex. brown, black, and white) of different sizes. The colors are to be separated and weighed, where the abundance is calculated by taking the mass of the beans and dividing it by the quantity to get the mass of the isotopes. Afterwards, with the mass of the isotopes and the abundance, the sample's average atomic mass is gotten by adding the mass contribution of the isotopes (which is calculated by multiplying the mass of the isotope with the abundance).<br><br>It is seen as a hands-on way to teach students how the average atomic mass is calculated and the influence that isotopes have on the weight of atoms. Most attempt to be silly, referencing popular culture such as Star Wars and The Simpsons.</div>
