  <h1>Beanium Lab</h1>
  <div>The Beanium Lab is a high school chemistry lab experiment where the student discovery a fiction element "Beanium" (sometimes called "Legumium") where they must find the different isotope for the bean.
There are 3-4 different beans of differing color (ex. brown, black, and white) of different sizes. The colors are to be separated and weighing, where the atomic abundance is calculated by taking the mass of the beans and division it by the quantity to get the mass of the isotopes. Afterwards, with the mass of the isotopes and the abundance, the sample average atomic mass is gotten by addition the mass contribution of the isotopes (which is calculated by multiplication the mass of the isotope with the abundance).&pIt is seen as a hands-on way to teaching students how the average atomic mass is calculated and the influence that isotopes have on the weight of atom. Most attempt to be silly, referencing popular culture such as Star Wars and The Simpsons.</div>
