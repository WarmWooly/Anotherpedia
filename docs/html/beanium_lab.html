The colors are to be separated and [[weighed|weighing]], where the [[abundance|atomic abundance]] is calculated by taking the [[mass]] of the beans and [[dividing|division]] it by the [[quantity]] to get the mass of the isotopes. Afterwards, with the mass of the isotopes and the abundance, the [[sample's|sample]] [[average atomic mass]] is gotten by [[adding|addition]] the [[mass contribution]] of the isotopes (which is calculated by [[multiplying|multiplication]] the mass of the isotope with the abundance).&pIt is seen as a [[hands-on]] way to [[teach|teaching]] students how the average atomic mass is calculated and the influence that isotopes have on the weight of [[atoms|atom]]. Most attempt to be [[silly]], referencing [[popular culture]] such as [[Star Wars]] and [[The Simpsons]].</div>
