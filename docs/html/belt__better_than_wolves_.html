Straps can be crafted with 4 straps (place in a circle).



Belts are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Bellows - 1 belt, 2 gears, 3 tanned leather/cut tanned leather, and 3 wood sidings (place the leather in the middle row, the sidings on the top row, the gears in the bottom corners, and the belt in the middle bottom slot).<br>Saw - 1 belt, 3 gears, 3 iron ingots, and 2 wood planks/sidings (place the iron in the top row, the belt in the middle slot, the gears to the left/right/bottom of the belt, and the wood in the bottom corners).

In a stoked cauldron, 2 belts can be processed into 1 glue.</div>
