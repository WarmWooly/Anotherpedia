FE is not used in any blocks/items in Not Lazy Chainmail, but rather made for cross-compatibility with mods that do use FE or other power systems.
The belt generator can be crafting (Minecraft) with 6 cobblestone (Minecraft) and 2 iron ingot (Minecraft) (fill the top and bottom rows with cobblestone, put iron in the left and right slots).
The belt generator requires an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better belts increasing the power generated. The following table shows the power generated through the belts:<<tableBelt|Power||Kelp Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 FE/tick (Minecraft)||Leather Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 FE/t||Copper Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2 FE/t||Iron Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3 FE/t||Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r4 FE/t||Rose Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r8 FE/t||Netherite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r16 FE/t||Iron Composite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r32 FE/ttable>></div>
