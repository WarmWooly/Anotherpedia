Fantastic job Sherlock Homeless<br>You take what's known; rediscover it. Less Columbo, more Columbus<br>And that glass eye would spill glass tears before you ever cracked a Glass Onion<br>Your entire charade is built on lies and folk tales<br>That body seems like just another target Mr. Falk tailed<br><br>[Batman]<br>Not quite, but because you play a chess match well<br>I am the Dark Knight and I've been following your path, L<br>We both were orphans, but through the pain, I forged my way with discipline<br>Your mind was molded in a program made for gifted kids<br>I don't think your goal's to save the innocent<br>Prestige must be sugar-laced; I know your brain's addicted to it<br>Your ego's feasted well off Tokyo's carcass<br>The perfect foil to Kira, because you're heartless<br>Treating lives like they're pawns. Spending all of your time<br>Watching the light, but make sure you mind the darkness<br>Gotham's Shinigami in the darkest corners of the city, watching<br>Preserving life and crashing any guilty party<br>Riddle-solving, it comes with the job, so hide as Hideki, L, or Ryuzaki.<br>There's no pseudonym that you're adopting which will stop me<br>All that effort to see Light indicted<br>Just to be written off by sidekick's sidekick<br>The pieces point to you from all sides. What will you do next?<br>It's checkmate, and you're just like your heart, with no moves left<br><br>[Shaggy Rogers]<br>How many damaged fragile assholes does it take to crack a murder scene?<br>Like, don't lash out at Shaggy, man, 'cuz it wasn't me!

I've seen dead bodies that bring better value than you<br>What do you actually do? No better than bait when your crew leaves you battered and bruised<br>Not a hard fact to deduce. Gathering clues on some Baskerville hounds<br>See a dog that can bite, tear a man to the ground, but the mutts laid before me are Shaggy and Scoob<br>Hercule, I can see you ain't aged well. No evidence, relying on your fake tells<br>My sidekick's a doctor; Arthur Hastings still ain't using his brain over his "gray cells"<br>Searching for the murderer in cottages and quaint dwells. Terminate a perpetrator 'fore they ever raise hell<br>Pray tell, you derail to distract from the pain when your wife derailed from the track<br>Like, Batman, all the tech that you got ain't helping you more than one like of coke<br>Under all of that stuff, you're down to the core, a regular bloke<br>Even L needs a force behind him; I'm solving crimes on my own<br>So go read about it; gain more renown with [Dr. Watson] every death that I note!<br>Riding through on a horse-drawn carriage, [Dr. Watson] right past Frank, who got caught in traffic<br>Run-down car, only banger he's havin'. [Dr. Watson] He's sorting clues, can't sort his marriage<br>Monsieur Blanc, here's advice I'm giving: stop the villain 'fore the crime's committed<br>[Dr. Watson] 'Cuz every visit you find a victim, [Sherlock Holmes] like you've been bribed by some sly morticians<br>Gathering the clues of the crime. [Dr. Watson] All you sleuths can't decide [Sherlock Holmes] on the culprit, [Dr. Watson] the weapon<br>[Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson] Or who's in the right, [Sherlock Holmes] but by looking how the lace on his shoe has been tied [Dr. Watson] and the stains of the juice on his thigh<br>That he tumbled and fell, I assume with a fright, [Dr. Watson] but I see no blood or a wound in my sight<br>With the use of my light, see the moves of his eye, I can only conclude that this dude's still alive!</div>
