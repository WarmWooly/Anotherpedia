  <h1>Benson countdown</h1>
  <div><<shortCN countdown banner for {{iRegular Show}}short>><<img(src=git/benson countdown.jpg(cap=The Benson countdown.img>>The {{bBenson countdown}} or {{bBenson timer}} was a [[countdown banner]] on [[Cartoon Network]] on July 15, 2013 promoting the new {{i[[Regular Show]]}} episodes "[[Blind Trust|Blind Trust (Regular Show)]]" and "[[World's Best Boss|World's Best Boss (Regular Show)]]" that aired between 8:00 PM and 8:30 PM [[ET|Eastern Time Zone]].<<ref(content=link|https://cnas.fandom.com/wiki/Countdown_Banners#2013_(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://cnas.fandom.com/wiki/July_15,_2013(text=refCountref>> [[Benson|Benson (Regular Show)]],  one of the primary characters within {{iRegular Show}} and the [[boss]] of the [[protagonists|protagonist]] [[Mordecai|Mordecai (Regular Show)]] and [[Rigby|Rigby (Regular Show)]], was of primary focus throughout the [[Season 4|Regular Show (season 4)]] episodes. In "Blind Trust", Benson becomes blinded while on a mountain with Mordecai and Rigby, relying on them to get him safely back to [[the park|The Park (Regular Show)]]. In "World's Best Boss", the employees of the park spend the episode attempting to acquire a [[mug]] labeled "World's Best Boss" for Benson. Since Benson was the main focus of these new episodes being counted down, Benson was featured in the countdown banner.<<hrDesignhr>>The banner was relatively small, resting near the top right corner of the screen. Benson's face, grumpy, is contained within a black square to the left of the banner. The rest of the banner is split into two sections: a white rectangle containing the countdown (formatted 00:00:00 for hours, minutes, seconds) in black text, and a black rectangle below it with white text reading "BENSON".<<hrMemeshr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIiOt4Wz6Vc(cap=A [[meme|internet meme]] of the Benson countdown.yt>>The Benson countdown is most known by its [[ominous]] design, having a countdown to "BENSON" as Benson stares. It is joked that he becomes activated or that the viewer will be [[fired|job termination]] when the countdown reaches 0. </div>
