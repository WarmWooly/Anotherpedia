      <h1>Benson countdown</h1>
      <div>The Benson countdown or Benson timer was a countdown banner on Cartoon Network on July 15, 2013 promoting the new Regular Show episodes "Blind Trust" and "World's Best Boss" that aired between 8:00 PM and 8:30 PM ET. Benson,  one of the primary characters within Regular Show and the boss of the protagonists Mordecai and Rigby, was of primary focus throughout the Season 4 episodes. In "Blind Trust", Benson becomes blinded while on a mountain with Mordecai and Rigby, relying on them to get him safely back to the park. In "World's Best Boss", the employees of the park spend the episode attempting to acquire a mug labeled "World's Best Boss" for Benson. Since Benson was the main focus of these new episodes being counted down, Benson was featured in the countdown banner.

The banner was relatively small, resting near the top right corner of the screen. Benson's face, grumpy, is contained within a black square to the left of the banner. The rest of the banner is split into two sections: a white rectangle containing the countdown (formatted 00:00:00 for hours, minutes, seconds) in black text, and a black rectangle below it with white text reading "BENSON".

The Benson countdown is most known by its ominous design, having a countdown to "BENSON" as Benson stares. It is joked that he becomes activated or that the viewer will be fired when the countdown reaches 0.</div>
