      <h1>BERGENTRUCK 201X</h1>
      <div>BERGENTRUCK 201X is a 2025 2D driving indie game by Paledoptera and Tizielechicero for QuinUT's "Out of Control" game jam. BERGENTRUCK 201X was released on Game Jolt on July 21, 2025. The game was made in the Godot Engine and is based on Triki_Tr0y's GIF Asgore Run over Dess. The gameplay is heavily inspired by Enviro-Bear 2010, where the player controls the truck using the mouse with physics simulation for objects within the vehicle.

BERGENTRUCK 201X depicts Asgore, as seen in Deltarune, driving his truck, with the mouse being used to control various aspects of the car. The player can turn the steering wheel, honk the horn to jump, shift their speed, and manipulate objects in the truck. The game is divided into three levels, each requiring the player to navigate obstacles and manage items within their truck while maintaining their health. The goal is to complete each task as quickly as possible, with a timer provided in-game to track progress. If the player loses all their health, Asgore gets arrested by Undyne.<br><br>The first level has the player run over flower bushes to collect flowers while dodging hazards, such as trees. When a flower bush is run over, flowers and leaves will flood the car, where the player must then grab the flowers or roll them towards Asgore's face to sniff.<br><br>The second level has the player run over berry bushes, Burgerpants, and other edibles to feed Asgore. Food items will fall into the car, where the player must then get the food over to Asgore's face, mirroring the gameplay of the first level.<br><br>The last level has the player run over Dess, where they will transform into the Roaring Knight. The player is tasked with dodging various attacks from the Roaring Knight through weaving and jumping until they run into them. After enough times, the Roaring Knight will fall, completing the game.</div>
