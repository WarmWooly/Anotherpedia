The game is divided into three levels, each requiring the player to navigate obstacles and manage items within their truck while maintaining their health. The goal is to complete each task as quickly as possible, with a timer provided in-game to track progress. If the player loses all their health, Asgore gets arrested by [[Undyne|Undyne (Deltarune)]].&pThe first level has the player run over flower bushes to collect flowers while dodging hazards, such as trees. When a flower bush is run over, flowers and leaves will flood the car, where the player must then grab the flowers or roll them towards Asgore's face to sniff.&pThe second level has the player run over berry bushes, [[Burgerpants|Burgerpants (Deltarune)]], and other edibles to feed Asgore. Food items will fall into the car, where the player must then get the food over to Asgore's face, mirroring the gameplay of the first level.&pThe last level has the player run over [[Dess|Dess (Undertale)]], where they will transform into the [[Roaring Knight|Roaring Knight (Deltarune)]]. The player is tasked with dodging various attacks from the Roaring Knight through weaving and jumping until they run into them. After enough times, the Roaring Knight will fall, completing the game.</div>
