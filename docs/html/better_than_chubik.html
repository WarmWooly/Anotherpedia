      <h1>Better Than Chubik</h1>
      <div>Better Than Chubik is a Minecraft texture pack created by Warm_Wooly posted onto the Better Than Wolves Discord on July 4, 2025, based on the Chubik texture pack, for the mod Better Than Wolves, specifically the 3.0.0 Beta. Unlike the original pack, only blocks and non-living mobs are updated, whereas animals, monsters, and items left untouched. Additonally, blocks from Better Than Wolves are also updated to match the Chubik style and each texture is 288x288 in size.</div>
