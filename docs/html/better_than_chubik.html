      <h1>Better Than Chubik</h1>
      <div>Better Than Chubik is a Minecraft Minecraft texture pack created by Warm_Wooly posted onto the Better Than Wolves Discord on July 4, 2025, based on the Chubik (texture pack), for the modding (Minecraft) Better Than Wolves, specifically the Better Than Wolves CE 3.0.0 Beta. Unlike the original pack, only block (Minecraft) and non-living mob (Minecraft) are updated, whereas animals, monsters, and item (Minecraft) left untouched. Additonally, blocks from Better Than Wolves are also updated to match the Chubik style and each texture is 288x288 in size.</div>
