All crafting recipe (Minecraft) for item (Minecraft) are swapped around randomly based on the seed (Minecraft). Items that do not have a crafting recipe will not be craftable.

Other processes, such as crafting in a soulforge (Better Than Wolves), millstone (Better Than Wolves), and saw (Better Than Wolves), are also unchanged.</div>
