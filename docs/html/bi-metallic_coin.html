      <h1>Bi-metallic coin</h1>
      <div>For coins made of one metal and coated in another, see plated coin.<br>A bi-metallic coin (also written bimetallic coin) is a coin that is comprised of two metal, generally with a distinction between the two metals in the form of an outer ring and inner core. They are constructed using a pair of coin blank, with the outer ring punching, the inner core inserted, and the entire coin coining (mint). Through this, the inner core is completely forced into the ring, keeping the pieces together. Bi-metallic coins tend to denote higher values of a currency and can be used as an anti-coin counterfeiting measure.</div>
