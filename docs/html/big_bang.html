  <h1>Big Bang</h1>
  <div>The {{bBig Bang}} is a theory for the birth of the universe, expansion from a single point (geometry) of all matter, energy and temperature. The theory was first proposed by Georges Lemaître in 1927, which currently matches the chemical element, cosmic microwave background, and the size of the universe. It still is trying to be aligned with the model of quantum gravity. Many models of the Big Bang started with a initial singularity over 13.78 billion years ago.</div>
