      <h1>Big Bang</h1>
      <div>The Big Bang is a theory for the birth of the universe, expanding from a single point of all matter, energy and temperature. The theory was first proposed by Georges Lemaître in 1927, which currently matches the chemical elements, cosmic microwave background, and the size of the universe. It still is trying to be aligned with the model of quantum gravity. Many models of the Big Bang started with a singularity over 13.78 billion years ago.</div>
