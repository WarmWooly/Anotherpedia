      <h1>Bigstone (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>Bigstone is a fan term for redstone contraption built on a 16x16-sized grid that mimics various redstone blocks and machines in Minecraft. Bigstone was first designed by Daxis1, with a complementary YouTube video showing it off on June 19, 2025. Bigstone uses redstone contraptions to simulate simple single Minecraft blocks or to act as entire machines in a single bigstone "block". Bigstone's tidy appearance and plug and play design encourages people to design and contribute to the bigstone community, which itself drives others to experiment and utilize bigstone blocks and machines made by others.</div>
