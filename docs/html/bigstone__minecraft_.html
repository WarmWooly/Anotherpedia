  <h1>Bigstone ({{iMinecraft}})</h1>
  <div><<shortLarge redstone build fan termshort>><<img(src=git/bigstone minecraft.png(cap=The first bigstone contraptions made by Daxis1.img>>{{bBigstone}} is a [[fan term]] for [[redstone contraptions|redstone contraption]] built on a 16x16-sized grid that mimics various redstone blocks and machines in {{i[[Minecraft]]}}. Bigstone was first designed by [[Daxis1]], with a complementary [[YouTube]] video showing it off on June 19, 2025.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IJjAAtt9Z0(text=refCountref>> Bigstone uses redstone contraptions to simulate simple single {{iMinecraft}} blocks or to act as entire machines in a single bigstone "block". Bigstone's tidy appearance and [[plug and play]] design encourages people to design and contribute to the bigstone community, which itself drives others to experiment and utilize bigstone blocks and machines made by others.</div>
