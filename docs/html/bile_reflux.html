  <h1>Bile reflux</h1>
  <div><<shortBile backing into stomach and esophagusshort>><<nomedical>><<img(src=git/bile reflux.avif(cap=A [[diagram]] of bile reflux.img>>{{bBile reflux}} is when [[bile]] (a [[liquid]] produced in the [[liver]]) gets backed up into the [[stomach]], and potentially the [[esophagus]]. Bile reflux is similar to [[gastric acid reflux]], and they may both be occurring simultaneously.&pBile reflux is often caused when the [[pyloric valve]] (bottom opening of the stomach) opens too much for too long, allowing bile in the [[small intestine]] to reflux back into the stomach during [[digestion]]. If the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (top opening of the stomach) is also opened or weak, the reflux may also go into the esophagus. [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[heartburn]], and [[chest pain]] are common [[symptoms|symptom]] of bile reflux. Bile reflux also has been linked with increased [[esophageal cancer]].</div>
