      <h1>Bile reflux</h1>
      <div><<nomedical>>Bile reflux is when bile (a liquid produced in the liver) gets backed up into the stomach, and potentially the esophagus. Bile reflux is similar to gastric acid reflux, and they may both be occurring simultaneously.<br><br>Bile reflux is often caused when the pyloric valve (bottom opening of the stomach) opens too much for too long, allowing bile in the small intestine to reflux back into the stomach during digestion. If the lower esophageal sphincter (top opening of the stomach) is also opened or weak, the reflux may also go into the esophagus. Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and chest pain are common symptom of bile reflux. Bile reflux also has been linked with increased esophageal cancer.</div>
