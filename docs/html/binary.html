      <h1>Binary</h1>
      <div>Binary is a system of representing numbers in base 2, where each digit can have a value up to 1. The numbers for the system are 0 and 1. It is used in computer logic and data storage because each value can represent a bit (off or on). They are also represented as false and true.</div>
