  <div><<shortNumber system using 0 and 1short>><<img(src=git/binary.gif(cap=Binary scrolling across the screen.img>>{{bBinary}} is a system of representing [[numbers|Number]] in base 2, where each digit can have a value up to 1. The numbers for the system are 0 and 1. It is used in computer logic and data storage because each value can represent a bit (off or on). They are also represented as [[false|False (programming)]] and [[true|True (programming)]].</div>
