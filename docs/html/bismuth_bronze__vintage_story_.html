Bismuth bronze is the weakest bronze, dealing less [[damage|damage (Vintage Story)]] and [[mining slower|mining speed (Vintage Story)]] compared to [[tin bronze|tin bronze (Vintage Story)]] and [[black bronze|black bronze (Vintage Story)]] counterparts. Bismuth bronze also has [[durability|durability (Vintage Story)]] greater than tin bronze, but less than black bronze. Bismuth bronze is created by placing bismuth, copper, and zinc in a [[crucible|crucible (Vintage Story)]], which can be heated with [[charcoal|charcoal (Vintage Story)]] or [[coal|coal (Vintage Story)]] to reach the necessary melting temperature. It can then be [[cast|casting (Vintage Story)]] into [[ingots|ingot mold (Vintage Story)]] or other [[molds|mold (Vintage Story)]], and the [[ingots|ingot (Vintage Story)]] can be [[smithed|smithing (Vintage Story)]] on a [[copper anvil|copper anvil (Vintage Story)]]. Bismuth bronze can be used for all the same purposes as tin bronze and black bronze. It is also the bronze that uses the least amount of copper, if the player is willing to spare extra bismuth and zinc. Bismuth bronze is most useful for creating tools and blocks that can harvest and work with [[iron|iron (Vintage Story)]], the following tier of metal.</div>
