      <div><<info||Stats||Metal tier|3||Smelting temp.|850 &degC||Workable temp.|425 &degC||Alloy Info||Bismuth (Vintage Story)|10--20%||Copper (Vintage Story)|50--70%||Zinc (Vintage Story)|20--30%info>>Bismuth bronze is a bronze (Vintage Story) alloying (Vintage Story) created using bismuth (Vintage Story), copper (Vintage Story), and zinc (Vintage Story). Bismuth bronze is the weakest bronze, dealing less damage (Vintage Story) and mining speed (Vintage Story) compared to tin bronze (Vintage Story) and black bronze (Vintage Story) counterparts. Bismuth bronze also has durability (Vintage Story) greater than tin bronze, but less than black bronze. Bismuth bronze is created by placing bismuth, copper, and zinc in a crucible (Vintage Story), which can be heated with charcoal (Vintage Story) or coal (Vintage Story) to reach the necessary melting temperature. It can then be casting (Vintage Story) into ingot mold (Vintage Story) or other mold (Vintage Story), and the ingot (Vintage Story) can be smithing (Vintage Story) on a copper anvil (Vintage Story). Bismuth bronze can be used for all the same purposes as tin bronze and black bronze. It is also the bronze that uses the least amount of copper, if the player is willing to spare extra bismuth and zinc. Bismuth bronze is most useful for creating tools and blocks that can harvest and work with iron (Vintage Story), the following tier of metal.</div>
