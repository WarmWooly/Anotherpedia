Bismuth bronze is the weakest bronze, dealing less damage and mining slower compared to tin bronze and black bronze counterparts. Bismuth bronze also has durability greater than tin bronze, but less than black bronze. Bismuth bronze is created by placing bismuth, copper, and zinc in a crucible, which can be heated with charcoal or coal to reach the necessary melting temperature. It can then be cast into ingots or other molds, and the ingots can be smithed on a copper anvil. Bismuth bronze can be used for all the same purposes as tin bronze and black bronze. It is also the bronze that uses the least amount of copper, if the player is willing to spare extra bismuth and zinc. Bismuth bronze is most useful for creating tools and blocks that can harvest and work with iron, the following tier of metal.</div>
