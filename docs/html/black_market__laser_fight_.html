      <h1>Black Market (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Black Market is a kill streak in Laser Fight that gives exp for your gun. The gun to be sold must be held. Most guns have their sell value calculated as codespawn time * (5/6), rounded to the nearest interval of 5. The Basic Gun has a sell value of 25 exp. Higher levels give more exp per gun. This streak only awards 1/5th the exp in the Gun Rain mode. This streak is disabled in the Starting Weapons, Arsenal, and One Gun Run modes.<<tableLevel|Skill Points|Kill Points|Effect||rLvl. 1|r-|r1|x1 sell value||rLvl. 2|r5|r2|x2 sell value||rLvl. 3|r10|r3|x4 sell valuetable>></div>
