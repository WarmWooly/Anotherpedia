  <h1>Black Market (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bBlack Market}} is a kill streak (Laser Fight) in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}} that gives experience (Laser Fight) for your gun (Laser Fight). The gun to be sold must be held. Most guns have their sell value calculated as {{codegun spawning (Laser Fight) * (5/6)}}, rounded to the nearest interval of 5. The Basic Gun (Laser Fight) has a sell value of 25 exp. Higher levels give more exp per gun. This streak only awards 1/5th the exp in the Gun Rain (Laser Fight) mode (Laser Fight). This streak is disabled in the Starting Weapons (Laser Fight), Arsenal (Laser Fight), and One Gun Run (Laser Fight) modes.<<table{{bLevel}}|{{bSkill Points}}|{{bKill Points}}|{{bEffect}}||{{rLvl. 1}}|{{r-}}|{{r1}}|x1 sell value||{{rLvl. 2}}|{{r5}}|{{r2}}|x2 sell value||{{rLvl. 3}}|{{r10}}|{{r3}}|x4 sell valuetable>></div>
