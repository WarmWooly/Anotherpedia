      <div>Black Stake is the fourth available Stake in Balatro, where: ;;Jokers have a 30% chance of having an Eternal Sticker (can't be sold or destroyed)|Blinds have faster scaling per Ante (requiring more chips to win)|Small Blind will not award any money;; The White, Red, and Green Stake must be defeated before unlocking the Black Stake. Upon defeating a Deck with the Black Stake, the Blue Stake will become unlocked, alongside the Anaglyph Deck.</div>
