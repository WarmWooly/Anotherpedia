Blocks exist on a [[cubic lattice]] where a single block can take up a single [[coordinate|coordinates (Minecraft)]] [[position]] in most cases. Blocks can be [[mined|mining (Minecraft)]] to be collected as [[items|item (Minecraft)]], which is a core component of {{iMinecraft}}'s game loop. Blocks can also be placed to build structures and used in [[crafting|crafting (Minecraft)]].&pBlocks have basic properties, including their [[hardness|hardness (Minecraft)]] (how hard it is to mine the block), [[blast resistance|blast resistance (Minecraft)]] (how strong the block is against [[explosions|explosion (Minecraft)]]), and a specified tool to mine the block. Blocks may require a tool to drop items, such as a [[stone pickaxe|stone pickaxe (Minecraft)]] for [[iron ore|iron ore (Minecraft)]] to drop [[raw iron|raw iron (Minecraft)]]. Some blocks have special properties, including taking up only part of a whole cube area ([[slabs|slab (Minecraft)]], [[stairs|stair (Minecraft)]], [[doors|door (Minecraft)]], [[ladders|ladder (Minecraft)]]), being affected by [[gravity|gravity (Minecraft)]] ([[sand|sand (Minecraft)]], [[gravel|grave (Minecraft)]]), being [[transparent|opacity (Minecraft)]] ([[glass|glass (Minecraft)]]), emitting [[light|light (Minecraft)]] ([[torches|torch (Minecraft)]], [[glowstone|glowstone (Minecraft)]]), or being [[flammable|flammable (Minecraft)]] ([[logs|log (Minecraft)]], [[wooden planks|wooden planks (Minecraft)]], [[leaves|leaves (Minecraft)]]). Space that is not taken up by a block is filled with [[air|air (Minecraft)]].</div>
