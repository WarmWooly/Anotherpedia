      <h1>Block (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>A block is the basic spatial unit for Minecraft that makes up the world, mostly in the form of solid cubes. Blocks exist on a cubic lattice where a single block can take up a single coordinate position in most cases. Blocks can be mined to be collected as items, which is a core component of Minecraft's game loop. Blocks can also be placed to build structures and used in crafting.<br><br>Blocks have basic properties, including their hardness (how hard it is to mine the block), blast resistance (how strong the block is against explosions), and a specified tool to mine the block. Blocks may require a tool to drop items, such as a stone pickaxe for iron ore to drop raw iron. Some blocks have special properties, including taking up only part of a whole cube area (slabs, stairs, doors, ladders), being affected by gravity (sand, gravel), being transparent (glass), emitting light (torches, glowstone), or being flammable (logs, wooden planks, leaves). Space that is not taken up by a block is filled with air.</div>
