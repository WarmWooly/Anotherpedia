  <h1>Block (Minecraft)</h1>
  <div>A {{bblock}} is the basic spatial unit for {{iMinecraft}} that makes up the world, mostly in the form of solid cube. Blocks exist on a cubic lattice where a single block can take up a single coordinates (Minecraft) position in most cases. Blocks can be mining (Minecraft) to be collected as item (Minecraft), which is a core component of {{iMinecraft}}'s game loop. Blocks can also be placed to build structures and used in crafting (Minecraft).&pBlocks have basic properties, including their hardness (Minecraft) (how hard it is to mine the block), blast resistance (Minecraft) (how strong the block is against explosion (Minecraft)), and a specified tool to mine the block. Blocks may require a tool to drop items, such as a stone pickaxe (Minecraft) for iron ore (Minecraft) to drop raw iron (Minecraft). Some blocks have special properties, including taking up only part of a whole cube area (slab (Minecraft), stair (Minecraft), door (Minecraft), ladder (Minecraft)), being affected by gravity (Minecraft) (sand (Minecraft), grave (Minecraft)), being opacity (Minecraft) (glass (Minecraft)), emitting light (Minecraft) (torch (Minecraft), glowstone (Minecraft)), or being flammable (Minecraft) (log (Minecraft), wooden planks (Minecraft), leaves (Minecraft)). Space that is not taken up by a block is filled with air (Minecraft).</div>
