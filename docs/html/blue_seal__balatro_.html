      <h1>Blue Seal (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Blue Stake ({{aiBalatro).}}&spA Blue Seal is a Seal for playing cards in Balatro. When a Blue Seal is left in the hand at the end of a round, a Planet Card based on the final hand played is created if there is room. Blue Seal can be obtained through the Spectral Card Trance or on cards randomly created in booster packs or the Shop.</div>
