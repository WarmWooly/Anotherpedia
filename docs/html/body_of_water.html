      <h1>Body of water</h1>
      <div>A body of water, waterbody, or water body, is an area of water contained on a planet's surface, such as a pond, lake, sea, or ocean. Bodies of water are most often used to describe water on Earth. Bodies of water may be used to also describe flowing water, including rivers, streams, and creeks. Roughly 71% of Earth's surface is covered in bodies of water.</div>
