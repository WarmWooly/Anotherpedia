  <h1>Bolf (Warm_Wooly)</h1>
  <div>{{iBolf}} is a top-down video game 2D video game golf game by Warm_Wooly made in GameMaker, first being available on October 2021 on itch.io.<<ref(content=link|https://warm-wooly.itch.io/bolf(text=refCountref>> Bolf can use mouse-only controls or keyboard-only controls controls and runs on Windows (OS). Bolf uses a randomly generated arrangement of tiles to create a course, where the player must shoot the ball into the hole within 5 strokes. As the game progresses, more randomized tiles and items are added to the board. The goal is to see how long the player can last before getting a bogey (going over the allotted strokes). Bolf is a portmanteau of bad and golf.
In Bolf, there are 7 tiles and 3 items in total: sand (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), ice (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), water (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), twist (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), boost (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), conveyor (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), pain (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), stroke refill (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), stroke deduction (Bolf Warm_Wooly game), and stroke mystery (Bolf Warm_Wooly game). The board is 11x10 (width x height), with the ball spawning on the position (5, 10). The hole can be located anywhere besides where the ball spawns. After each hole, the board resets and spawns in the number of tiles/items based on the current hole:<<tableTile/Item|{{r1}}|{{r2}}|{{r3}}|{{r4}}|{{r5}}|{{r6}}|{{r7}}|{{r8}}||Sand|r2|r4|r6|r8|r58|r60|r62|r64||Ice|r10|r12|r14|r16|r68|r70|r72|r74||Water|r18|r20|r22|r24|r76|r78|r80|r<<note(content=This is a bug where the spawn condition is set to hole '8', causing two water tiles to be added to the spawning pool on hole 80 instead of one.(text=noteCountnote>>80||Twist|r26|r28|r30|r32|r84|r86|r88|r90||Stroke Refill|r27|r77|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-||Boost|r34|r36|r38|r40|r92|r94|r96|r98||Stroke Deduction|r37|r87|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-||Conveyor|r42|r44|r46|r48|r100|r102|r104|r106||Stroke Mystery|r47|r97|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-||Pain|r50|r52|r54|r56|r108|r110|r112|r114table>></div>
