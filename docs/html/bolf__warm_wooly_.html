      <h1>Bolf (Warm_Wooly)</h1>
      <div>{{iBolf}} is a top-down 2D golf game by Warm_Wooly made in GameMaker, first being available on October 2021 on itch.io. Bolf can use mouse- or keyboard-only controls and runs on Windows. Bolf uses a randomly generated arrangement of tiles to create a course, where the player must shoot the ball into the hole within 5 strokes. As the game progresses, more randomized tiles and items are added to the board. The goal is to see how long the player can last before getting a bogey (going over the allotted strokes). Bolf is a portmanteau of bad and golf.

In Bolf, there are 7 tiles and 3 items in total: sand, ice, water, twist, boost, conveyor, pain, stroke refill, stroke deduction, and stroke mystery. The board is 11x10 (width x height), with the ball spawning on the position (5, 10). The hole can be located anywhere besides where the ball spawns. After each hole, the board resets and spawns in the number of tiles/items based on the current hole:<<tableTile/Item|{{r1}}|{{r2}}|{{r3}}|{{r4}}|{{r5}}|{{r6}}|{{r7}}|{{r8}}||Sand|r2|r4|r6|r8|r58|r60|r62|r64||Ice|r10|r12|r14|r16|r68|r70|r72|r74||Water|r18|r20|r22|r24|r76|r78|r80|r80||Twist|r26|r28|r30|r32|r84|r86|r88|r90||Stroke Refill|r27|r77|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-||Boost|r34|r36|r38|r40|r92|r94|r96|r98||Stroke Deduction|r37|r87|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-||Conveyor|r42|r44|r46|r48|r100|r102|r104|r106||Stroke Mystery|r47|r97|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-|r-||Pain|r50|r52|r54|r56|r108|r110|r112|r114table>></div>
