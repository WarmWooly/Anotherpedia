      <h1>Bolo round</h1>
      <div>A bolo round or ball and chain round is an exotic ammunition shotgun cartridge filled with a pair of heavy metal (usually lead) balls connected with a wire shaped like a bolas. Like a shotgun slug, the round acts as a single object to bullet penetration a target, with the wire keeping the balls together. Ideally, the bolo round spreads out, allowing the round to fully cut into the target and potentially wrap inside. However, the bolo round can remain compacted the entire flight, effectively making it a weaker slug.</div>
