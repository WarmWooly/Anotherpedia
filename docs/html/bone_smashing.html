      <h1>Bone smashing</h1>
      <div><<nodanger>>Bone smashing is the process of using a blunt object (often a hammer) to chip and break bones in the face and jaw to have them heal into a more desirable shape. Bone smashing does not do this, instead causing bruises, bleeding, and possibly disfigurement of the face for life. It is used as a part of looksmaxxing, despite those praising it often using makeup to make fake bruises because of their knowledge that bone smashing does not work.</div>
