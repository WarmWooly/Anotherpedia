  <h1>Book</h1>
  <div>A {{bbook}} is printing or writing information (such as word or image) on paper or other similar material book binding together, often inside of a book cover. The recordkeeping tool, the codex, was the predecessor of the book. Books are still quite popular, despite the creation of the ebook and the audiobook. The main use of a book is to be reading, but they can also be book review, Book discussion club, Book report, and used as a book decoration.</div>
