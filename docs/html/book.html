      <h1>Book</h1>
      <div>A book is printed or written information (such as words or images) on paper or other similar material bound together, often inside of a cover. The recordkeeping tool, the codex, was the predecessor of the book. Books are still quite popular, despite the creation of the ebook and the audiobook. The main use of a book is to be read, but they can also be reviewed, discussed, analyzed, and used as a decoration.</div>
