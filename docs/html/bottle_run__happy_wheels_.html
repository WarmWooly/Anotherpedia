      <h1>Bottle Run (Happy Wheels)</h1>
      <div>A Bottle Run is a level genre within Happy Wheels where the player attempts to ride across bottles to make it to the finish line without slowing down and falling through the bottles. The main challenge comes from trying to stay upright while going fast enough to not fall through or into the bottles. A boost is used to initially give speed to the player to cross the bottles, with different levels using various amounts of boost. Text or different colors of bottles can indicate the "difficulty" of reaching that far into the run.&pIrresponsible Dad is the most used character for Bottle Runs, with Segway Guy or even Wheelchair Guy occasionally used instead. Bottle Runs often increase their difficulty by spreading out the bottles, slightly changing the angle at which the bottles are tilted, adding arrow guns or harpoons, or increasing the length of the run with more boosts. Levels may even intersperse parkour or other challenges between Bottle Run sections. With the Irresponsible Dad, the strategy is to move forward while tapping the tilt left to continuously do a wheelie across the bottles. Some levels will forcefully remove the Irresponsible Son from the Dad, slightly influencing the way it is handled. Using Ctrl can also remove the Son, decreasing the overall weight on the bike for running across bottles.</div>
