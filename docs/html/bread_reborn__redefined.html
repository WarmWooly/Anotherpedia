      <h1>Bread Reborn: Redefined</h1>
      <div>{{iBread Reborn: Redefined}} is a Minecraft mod (Minecraft) made by Warm_Wooly in MCreator on September 6, 2025, adding millstones (Bread Reborn: Redefined), flours (Bread Reborn: Redefined), and new breads (Bread Reborn: Redefined). It also adds a new breadmaking station (Bread Reborn: Redefined) to combine breads into a bread platter (Bread Reborn: Redefined). The mod is based on Bread Reborn and Bread reborn: reborn, with the inspiration for its millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined) based on the ones from Millstone (Yanny's Stone Age) and Millstone (Farmer's Plus).
