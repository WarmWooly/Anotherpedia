      <h1>Breeding Harness (Better Than Wolves)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|No||Buoyancy|Floatsinfo>>The breeding harness is an item in the Minecraft mod Better Than Wolves used to restrict the movement of animals for breeding.



Breeding harnesses can be crafted with 4 straps and 5 tanned leather/cut tanned leather (place the leather in a + shape, then place the straps in the corners).



When using a breeding harness on a cow, pig, sheep, or mooshroom, the animal will be donned in black wear and will become unable to move. Other animals (such as chickens and horses) can't wear a breeding harness. Cows will no longer produce milk, sheep will no longer produce wool, and mooshrooms will be turned into cows when worn. Cows/mooshrooms can't kick players or mobs with a breeding harness on. The breeding harness can only be recovered by killing the animal wearing it.<br><br>The main use of the breeding harness is to create an automatic farm where two animals are constantly fed and bred, allowing the offspring to freely leave while keeping the animals for breeding stuck in place.

In a stoked cauldron, a breeding harness can be processed into 3 glue.

When a rank 3 Butcher is ready to level up, they will trade 3 emeralds for a breeding harness to level up to rank 4. After the trade, the Butcher will appear to be wearing the breeding harness. The Butcher's movement will not be inhibited while wearing the breeding harness.</div>
