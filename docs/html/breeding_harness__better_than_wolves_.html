      <h1>Breeding Harness (Better Than Wolves)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|No||Buoyancy|Floatsinfo>>The breeding harness is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft modding (Minecraft) Better Than Wolves used to restrict the movement of animals for breeding.



Breeding harnesses can be crafting (Minecraft) with 4 strap (Better Than Wolves) and 5 tanned leather (Better Than Wolves)/cut tanned leather (Better Than Wolves) (place the leather in a + shape, then place the straps in the corners).



When using a breeding harness on a cow (Better Than Wolves), pig (Better Than Wolves), sheep (Better Than Wolves), or mooshroom (Better Than Wolves), the animal will be donned in black wear and will become unable to move. Other animals (such as chicken (Better Than Wolves) and horse (Better Than Wolves)) can't wear a breeding harness. Cows will no longer produce milk (Better Than Wolves), sheep will no longer produce wool (Better Than Wolves item), and mooshrooms will be turned into cows when worn. Cows/mooshrooms can't kick players or mobs with a breeding harness on. The breeding harness can only be recovered by killing the animal wearing it.<br><br>The main use of the breeding harness is to create an automatic farm where two animals are constantly fed and bred, allowing the offspring to freely leave while keeping the animals for breeding stuck in place.

In a hibachi (Better Than Wolves) cauldron (Better Than Wolves), a breeding harness can be processed into 3 glue (Better Than Wolves).

When a rank 3 Butcher (Better Than Wolves) is ready to level up, they will trade 3 emerald (Better Than Wolves) for a breeding harness to level up to rank 4. After the trade, the Butcher will appear to be wearing the breeding harness. The Butcher's movement will not be inhibited while wearing the breeding harness.</div>
