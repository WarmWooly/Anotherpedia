      <h1>Breloom</h1>
      <div>Breloom is a mushroom-based Grass and Fighting type Pokémon from the third generation.

Breloom has a green, rotund body with large legs, stubby arms, a tail, and a collared neck. Its yellowish-white head has a sharp, overhanging jaw with a pair of black eyes and a mushroom-shaped cap. On top of its head are a pair of red olive-shaped extrusions to its sides. The neck connects to the body with eight long petals. Breloom's hands each have a pair of pincer-like red claws, where its feet have a pair of spiky claws. Its tail shares the same yellowish-white coloration as its head with four green spherical seeds at the end.<br><br>Breloom's official size is 3 ft and 11 in., while weighing 86.4 lbs. Shiny Brelooms are red and yellow instead of green and red.<br><br>Breloom's name partly comes from mushroom.

Breloom's diet consists of leaves and wild plants. Breloom uses its legs to close its distance to foes, packing powerful punches from their surprisingly stretchy arms and spreading spores of various effects from its cap's holes. The seeds on its tail are made of hardened spores and shouldn't be eaten.

A Breloom has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Breloom is the 286th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color green.<br><br>Breloom evolves from Shroomish at level 23.</div>
