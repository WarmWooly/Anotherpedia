      <h1>Brick</h1>
      <div>A brick is a material which is used to construct walls, paths, or other structures related to masonry, known as brickwork. Bricks used to be defined by their use of clay, but many now come in different chemical compositions. Bricks are often paired with mortar to hold their shape. Bricks have been used for thousands of years and are still in use to this day.</div>
