      <h1>Bullet penetration</h1>
      <div>Bullet penetration is the measurement of penetration from a bullet. There are several factors that affect how far a bullet will penetrate into or through an object or person, such as the fire distance, the angle of the bullet impact, the bullet speed of the bullet, the density of the bullet and target, and the bullet shape of the bullet.</div>
