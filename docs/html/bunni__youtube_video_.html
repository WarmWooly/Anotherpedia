      <h1>bunni (YouTube video)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with the YouTuber bunnispams.<br>"bunni" is a YouTube video made by revanoke on October 28, 2025, where a person repeatedly says "bunny" as image of rabbit populates a starry background. It became notable due to being shown as an advertisement on the platform while also being made 13 years after revanoke's prior video. The video could potentially be a troll video, especially due to the odd nature of the video's contents and revanoke's history of creating other trolling videos for Apple Inc. products and Battlefield 4. "Bunny" is said 230 times, with 9 unique rabbit images (10 rabbits total) shown throughout. The video is 2 minute and 22 second in length.</div>
