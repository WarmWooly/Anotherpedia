  <h1>Bunnyhopping ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortJumping movement action in {{iLaser Fightshort>><<img(src=git/bunnyhop laser fight.png(cap=A player with a x2 bunnyhop bonus from jumping 10 times in a row.img>>{{bBunnyhopping}} is a [[movement action|movement (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} triggered by moving while repeatedly [[jumping|jump (Laser Fight)]]. Every jump after the third in a bunnyhop will increase the normal movement speed by 10% and will only cost 3 [[stamina|stamina (Laser Fight)]] to perform. A bunnyhop ends when a player stops jumping/moving, hits a wall, suddenly changes direction, or runs out of stamina. Bunnyhopping can be used to quickly navigate the map and increase the speed of other movement options. For every 10 jumps in a bunnyhop, the player gets {{codejumps/2}} [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]], with 10 jumps = 5 exp, 20 jumps = 10, and so on. If a player gets a bunnyhop with 30 jumps outside the [[Infinite Stamina|Infinite Stamina (Laser Fight)]] [[mode|mode (Laser Fight)]], they are awarded the [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[Bunnyhopper|Bunnyhopper (Laser Fight)]].</div>
