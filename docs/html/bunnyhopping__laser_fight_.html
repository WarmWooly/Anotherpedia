  <h1>Bunnyhopping (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bBunnyhopping}} is a movement (Laser Fight) in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}} triggered by moving while repeatedly jump (Laser Fight). Every jump after the third in a bunnyhop will increase the normal movement speed by 10% and will only cost 3 stamina (Laser Fight) to perform. A bunnyhop ends when a player stops jumping/moving, hits a wall, suddenly changes direction, or runs out of stamina. Bunnyhopping can be used to quickly navigate the map and increase the speed of other movement options. For every 10 jumps in a bunnyhop, the player gets {{codejumps/2}} experience (Laser Fight), with 10 jumps = 5 exp, 20 jumps = 10, and so on. If a player gets a bunnyhop with 30 jumps outside the Infinite Stamina (Laser Fight) mode (Laser Fight), they are awarded the badge (Roblox) Bunnyhopper (Laser Fight).</div>
