      <h1>Bunnyhopping (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Bunnyhopping is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by moving while repeatedly jumping. Every jump after the third in a bunnyhop will increase the normal movement speed by 10% and will only cost 3 stamina to perform. A bunnyhop ends when a player stops jumping/moving, hits a wall, suddenly changes direction, or runs out of stamina. Bunnyhopping can be used to quickly navigate the map and increase the speed of other movement options. For every 10 jumps in a bunnyhop, the player gets codejumps/2 exp, with 10 jumps = 5 exp, 20 jumps = 10, and so on. If a player gets a bunnyhop with 30 jumps outside the Infinite Stamina mode, they are awarded the badge Bunnyhopper.</div>
