      <h1>Burden of proof (logical fallacy)</h1>
      <div><<shortNot supporting a claimshort>><<img(src=git/burden of proof lf.jpg(cap=A representation of someone with the burden of proof.img>>The {{bburden of proof}}, as a [[logical fallacy]], is when a person makes a [[claim]] and thusly says that another person must prove their claim is wrong instead of using [[facts|fact]] or [[evidence]] to back up their claim. It can be used to shift the burden of supporting an argument from "this proves I'm right" to "you can't prove that I'm wrong." The person who makes a claim is the one who has to support it.</div>
