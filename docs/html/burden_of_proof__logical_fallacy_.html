      <h1>Burden of proof (logical fallacy)</h1>
      <div>The burden of proof, as a logical fallacy, is when a person makes a claim and thusly says that another person must prove their claim is wrong instead of using facts or evidence to back up their claim. It can be used to shift the burden of supporting an argument from "this proves I'm right" to "you can't prove that I'm wrong." The person who makes a claim is the one who has to support it.</div>
