      <h1>Burning Pledge (Hexaria)</h1>
      <div>Burning Pledge is an card rarity (Hexaria) card in the Roblox game Hexaria which gives the caster Bit (Hexaria) in exchange for a permanent source of damage (Hexaria).

BP became a symbol of wealth for a short period of time after release until further updates caused other cards to take the spotlight.
