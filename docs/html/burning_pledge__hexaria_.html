      <h1>Burning Pledge (Hexaria)</h1>
      <div>Burning Pledge is an ultra-rare card in the Roblox game Hexaria which gives the caster Bits in exchange for a permanent source of damage. On release, Burning Pledge, abbreviated as BP or bp, became highly sought after due to the difficulty of grinding Waelyn Cindra and the time it would take per battle, skyrocketing the cost as it was integrated into strategies relying on gaining large sums of Bits from BP. BP became a symbol of wealth for a short period of time after release until further updates caused other cards to take the spotlight.
