  <h1>Burning Pledge ({{iHexaria}})</h1>
  <div><<shortUltra-rare Bit-gaining card in {{iHexaria}}short>><<img(src=git/burning pledge.png(cap=The card Burning Pledge.img>>{{bBurning Pledge}} is an [[ultra-rare|card rarity (Hexaria)]] card in the [[Roblox]] game {{i[[Hexaria]]}} which gives the caster [[Bits|Bit (Hexaria)]] in exchange for a permanent source of [[damage|damage (Hexaria)]]. On release, Burning Pledge, [[abbreviated]] as BP or bp, became highly sought after due to the difficulty of [[grinding|grinding (Hexaria)]] Waelyn Cindra and the time it would take per [[battle|battle (Hexaria)]], skyrocketing the cost as it was integrated into strategies relying on gaining large sums of Bits from BP. BP became a symbol of [[wealth]] for a short period of time after release until further updates caused other cards to take the spotlight.<<hrCard statshr>>{{bName:}} Burning Pledge&sp{{bTarget:}} Self&sp{{b[[Quickplay|Quickplay (Hexaria)]]:}} No&sp{{bBit cost:}} 0&sp{{bEffects:}} Gives 3 bits and the effect [[Eternal Burn|Eternal Burn (Hexaria)]].
