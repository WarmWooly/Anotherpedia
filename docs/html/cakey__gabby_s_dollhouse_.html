      <h1>Cakey (Gabby's Dollhouse)</h1>
      <div>Cakey is a fictional character from the show Gabby's Dollhouse. Cakey is considered a Gabby cat. He is voiced by Juliet Donenfeld.
Cakey resembles a cat-like cupcake, comprised of a head, body, and a pair of arms and legs. His body is a cupcake wrapper, which is colored in a gradient from cyan to magenta (bottom to top). Chubby arms and legs pop out from the bottom and sides of the wrapper, with sprinkles that resemble paws. His head has a pair of blue eyes, a mouth, a sprinkle nose, three sprinkle whiskers on each side, three sprinkles on his head, a pair of sharp ears, and blush.
Cakey is hyperactive and generally excited, hopping around and throwing "sprinkle parties" when exuberant (spreading sprinkles around the nearby area). When upset, he cries sprinkles. He enjoys baking, suprises, playing cards, and his Cupcake Cousins, but dislikes not being heard or sudden plan changes, alongside being covered/stuck in sticky substances. His birthday is on December 15th.&pCakey acts as the chef for the dollhouse, making meals for other characters, alongside teaching the audience how to make their own culinary creations. Cakey is also able to be a mechanic.</div>
