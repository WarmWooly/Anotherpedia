  <h1>Cancer</h1>
  <div>For the astrological sign, see cancer (sign).&spCancer is a categorization of a disease caused by a mutation in a cell that causes it to constantly cell division, which destroys nearby tissue around it. Cancer can affect anyone at any moment, but it is more likely to occur in people who do activities that damage cells, such as UV radiation exposure, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and more. Due to the nature of cancer, it has a wide array of symptoms, such as breathing difficulties, chest pain, blood coming out of the body (such as coughing), and so on. There is no single cure for cancer, but treatment such as chemotherapy and surgery can be used.</div>
