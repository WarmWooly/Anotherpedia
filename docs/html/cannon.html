      <h1>Cannon</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with canon.<br>A cannon is a massive firearm that is used to launch large projectiles often with the aid of explosive materials. Many cannons are mounted to wheels, carts, or other vehicles due to their weight. A significant portion of cannons are made of metal to withstand the forces to launch projectiles such as cannonballs.</div>
