      <div>Canon, fanon, your design was a fan art trend in early 2023, started on Twitter, consisting of three panels labeled canon, fanon, and your design. The purpose was to put artwork of the canon depiction of a character, then a fanon based on the fandom's interpretation, then a fan redesign of the character.</div>
