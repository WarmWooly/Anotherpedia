  <h1>Canon, fanon, your design</h1>
  <div>{{bCanon, fanon, your design}} was a fan art art trend in early 2023, started on Twitter, consisting of three panels labeled {{icanon}}, {{ifanon}}, and {{iyour design}}. The purpose was to put artwork of the canon (fiction) depiction of a character, then a fanon (fiction) based on the fandom's interpretation, then a fan redesign of the character.</div>
