      <h1>Caramelization</h1>
      <div>Caramelization is the process of liquifying sugar by slowly heating it, browning it. The main purpose is to sweeten food or to make caramel. It is often done with pure sugar or with vegetables such as onions. The exact chemical reactions which takes place are still being studied as it is a complex interaction which can change based on the sugar or food item being caramelized. Chemicals such as diacetyl are released, providing the caramel flavor, and the polymers caramelans, caramelans, and caramelins, providing the color.</div>
