      <h1>Carpool</h1>
      <div>For larger carpools in vans or similar vehicles, see vanpool.&spFor other terms related to carpool, see carpool (disambiguation).&spA carpool is the sharing of a car among multiple people, especially with friends or family, when driving between locations (especially if the passengers share the start or end location). Carpooling's main benefits include reducing the cost of fuel and tolls compared to multiple people driving, and in some cases, being allowed to drive along specialized carpool lanes that incentivize carpooling. Other benefits include decreased traffic, reduced emissions, and reduced parking demand.<<ref(content=link|https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7jx6z631(text=refCountref>></div>
