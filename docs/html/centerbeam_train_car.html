      <h1>Centerbeam train car</h1>
      <div>A centerbeam train car, also called a centerbeam railcar, is a train car used to transport bundled goods, often in rectangular packaging. Most centerbeam train cars are made to carry up to 200,000 lbs of materials, which are often building materials such as wood. It is called a centerbeam because there are beams in the center of the car that are used to reinforce the center of gravity and provide the ability to secure materials on both sides of the car.</div>
