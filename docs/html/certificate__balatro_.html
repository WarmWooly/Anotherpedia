      <h1>Certificate (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Certificate is a Joker in Balatro that creates a playing card with a Seal at the start of a Blind. This playing card will have a random Suit and Rank, but it will not have any Enhancements or Editions.&pThis ability to generate a Seal can be quite powerful, allowing for an improved money, Tarot, and Planet generation with the Gold, Purple, and Blue Seals respectively. The Red Seal's retriggering effect can also be useful for Jokers that activate on specific cards and for Steel and Gold Cards.
Effect: When round begins, add a random playing card with a random seal to your hand&spRarity: Uncommon&spUnlock: Have a Gold Card with a Gold Seal.&spBuy/Sell Cost: $6/$3&spActivation: Blind Start&spCopyable: Yes&spPerishable: Yes&spEternalable: Yes
;;Magic Deck's additional Consumable slot increases the amount of Tarots and Planets able to be generated and held, increasing the value of Purple and Blue Seals drastically.|Abandoned Deck's reduced size of 40 (from 52) makes it more likely to draw one of the created Sealed cards, improving their usage. They may also be a crude way to generate face cards if needed for a powerful Joker such as Baron and Triboulet.|Painted Deck benefits from improved playing cards because of its increased hand size and reduced Joker slots, moreso relying on powerful cards to improve hands. However, the decreased Joker real estate makes it risky to keep Certificate for long compared to Jokers that increase Chips or Mult.|Red Deck and Zodiac Deck both offer improved use of Purple Seals, with the extra Discard from Red Deck increasing used Purple Seals and the extra Tarot cards from Zodiac Deck being minor improvements for Certificate.|Nebula Deck's reduced Consumable slot goes against Certificate's Purple and Blue Seals, decreasing the quantity of generatable Tarot and Planet cards.|Checkered Deck will be adversely affected by the random cards, as Clubs and Diamonds may throw off Flush builds established with Spades and/or Hearts.;;
;;Observatory directly benefits from Blue Seals generating Planet cards within the Consumable slots, gaining X1.5 Mult per held Planet card.|Wasteful and Recyclomancy adds an additional Discard each, increasing the value of Purple Seals generated.|Crystal Ball's additional Consumable slot increases the amount of Tarots and Planets able to be generated and held, increasing the value of Purple and Blue Seals drastically.|Paint Brush and Palette increase hand size, allowing for more Sealed cards to be found and held, especially ones with Blue Seals.|Heiroglyph and Petroglyph reduces the current Ante by 1, allowing for more rounds to generate cards through Certificate. However, Petroglyph's reduced Discards go against generated Purple Seals.;;
Most poker hands will not be boosted because of the random nature of generated cards, with High Card and Pair as the safest bets when using Certificate. Decks relying on Flushes and Straights may be adversely affected by random cards with Suits and Ranks that go against potential deck fixing.
Certificate's randomness can both be a blessing and a curse, generating great Seals aligned with held Jokers or generating Seals that go against the build. With only 4 Seals, the odds of getting a specific Seal are the same as using a Wheel every Blind. If Certificate is obtained early enough in the run, eventually multiple favorable Seals will be generated.;;Blueprint and Brainstorm are likely the best Jokers for Certificate, generating extra Sealed cards at the start of a Blind while also being able to be used on other Jokers when it is time to score.|Hologram gains X0.25 Mult for every playing card added to the deck, effectively giving a minimum of a free X0.25 Mult every Blind.|Flash Card, Red Card, Bull, and Bootstraps all benefit from the money generated through Gold Seals. A Gold Seal on a Gold Card would pair well with a Golden Ticket, adding additional money generation. Cards that retrigger effects, such as Dusk, Hack, Seltzer, Hanging Chad, and Sock and Buskin, increase the value of Gold Seals drastically and pair well with money-focused Jokers. The Hermit and Temperance, which can be generated through Purple Seals, can also be used to help synergize with these Jokers.|Constellation can be greatly boosted by the up to 3 Planet cards generated per Blind through Blue Seals, with a best-case scenario of X0.3 added every Blind. This, in combination with the value of Planet cards, can allow for a strong mid-to-late game scaling.|Fortune Teller benefits from generated Purple Seals, increasing the Mult for solid early-to-mid game scaling. When paired with Vampire, who benefits from Enhancments that can be generated through Tarot Cards, it creates a solid base that can be used for later Blinds.|Jokers relying or specific Suits or Ranks may benefit or be harmed by the randomly generated cards through Certificate, such as Wee Joker, Bloodstone, and Photograph. Certificate can be quite valuable when lucky, but there is a 1 in 4 chance to get a specific Suit and a much worse 1 in 13 chance to get a specific Rank. Tarot cards generated through Purple Seals can aid in deck fixing, but it overall is risky to build around Certificate.|Throwback, which incentivizes skipping Blinds, reduces the number of generated cards through Certificate.|Erosion doesn't work well with Certificate because of Certificate's card generation going against the +4 Mult for every fewer card than 52 in a deck.;;</div>
