  <h1>Certificate ({{iBalatro}})</h1>
  <div><<shortSealed card-generating Joker in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/certificate balatro.png(cap=Certificate.img>>{{bCertificate}} is a [[Joker|Jokers (Balatro)]] in {{i[[Balatro]]}} that creates a [[playing card|playing cards (Balatro)]] with a [[Seal|Seals (Balatro)]] at the start of a [[Blind|Blinds (Balatro)]]. This playing card will have a random [[Suit|Suits (Balatro)]] and [[Rank|Ranks (Balatro)]], but it will not have any [[Enhancements|Enhancements (Balatro)]] or [[Editions|Editions (Balatro)]].&pThis ability to generate a Seal can be quite powerful, allowing for an improved [[money|money (Balatro)]], [[Tarot|Tarot Cards (Balatro)]], and [[Planet|Planet Cards (Balatro)]]  generation with the [[Gold|Gold Seal (Balatro)]], [[Purple|Purple Seal (Balatro)]], and [[Blue Seals|Blue Seal (Balatro)]] respectively. The [[Red Seal's|Red Seal (Balatro)]] retriggering effect can also be useful for Jokers that activate on specific cards and for [[Steel|Steel Card (Balatro)]] and [[Gold Cards|Gold Card (Balatro)]].<<hrCard statshr>>{{bEffect:}} When round begins, add a random playing card with a random seal to your hand&sp{{b[[Rarity|Rarity (Balatro)]]:}} Uncommon&sp{{bUnlock:}} Have a [[Gold Card|Gold Card (Balatro)]] with a [[Gold Seal|Gold Seal (Balatro)]].&sp{{b[[Buy|Buying (Balatro)]]/[[Sell|Selling (Balatro)]] Cost:}} [[$|Money (Balatro)]]6/$3&sp{{b[[Activation|Activation Type (Balatro)]]:}} Blind Start&sp{{b[[Copyable|Copying (Balatro)]]:}} Yes&sp{{b[[Perishable|Perishable Sticker (Balatro)]]:}} Yes&sp{{b[[Eternalable|Eternal Sticker (Balatro)]]:}} Yes<<hrSynergies and anti-synergieshr>><<hr2Deckshr2>>;;[[Magic Deck's|Magic Deck (Balatro)]] additional [[Consumable slot|Consumable slots (Balatro)]] increases the amount of Tarots and Planets able to be generated and held, increasing the value of Purple and Blue Seals drastically.|[[Abandoned Deck's|Abandoned Deck (Balatro)]] reduced size of 40 (from 52) makes it more likely to draw one of the created Sealed cards, improving their usage. They may also be a crude way to generate [[face cards|face card (Balatro)]] if needed for a powerful Joker such as [[Baron|Baron (Balatro)]] and [[Triboulet|Triboulet (Balatro)]].|[[Painted Deck|Painted Deck (Balatro)]] benefits from improved playing cards because of its increased [[hand size|hand size (Balatro)]] and reduced [[Joker slots|Joker slots (Balatro)]], moreso relying on powerful cards to improve hands. However, the decreased Joker real estate makes it risky to keep Certificate for long compared to Jokers that increase [[Chips|Chips (Balatro)]] or [[Mult|Mult (Balatro)]].|[[Red Deck|Red Deck (Balatro)]] and [[Zodiac Deck|Zodiac Deck (Balatro)]] both offer improved use of Purple Seals, with the extra [[Discard|Discard (Balatro)]] from Red Deck increasing used Purple Seals and the extra Tarot cards from Zodiac Deck being minor improvements for Certificate.|[[Nebula Deck's|Nebula Deck (Balatro)]] reduced Consumable slot goes against Certificate's Purple and Blue Seals, decreasing the quantity of generatable Tarot and Planet cards.|[[Checkered Deck|Checkered Deck (Balatro)]] will be adversely affected by the random cards, as [[Clubs|Clubs (Balatro)]] and [[Diamonds|Diamonds (Balatro)]] may throw off [[Flush builds|Flush build (Balatro)]] established with [[Spades|Spades (Balatro)]] and/or [[Hearts|Hearts (Balatro)]].;;<<hr2Vouchershr2>>;;[[Observatory|Observatory (Balatro)]] directly benefits from Blue Seals generating Planet cards within the Consumable slots, gaining X1.5 [[Mult|Mult (Balatro)]] per held Planet card.|[[Wasteful|Wasteful (Balatro)]] and [[Recyclomancy|Recyclomancy (Balatro)]] adds an additional Discard each, increasing the value of Purple Seals generated.|[[Crystal Ball's|Crystal Ball (Balatro)]] additional Consumable slot increases the amount of Tarots and Planets able to be generated and held, increasing the value of Purple and Blue Seals drastically.|[[Paint Brush|Paint Brush (Balatro)]] and [[Palette|Palette (Balatro)]] increase hand size, allowing for more Sealed cards to be found and held, especially ones with Blue Seals.|[[Heiroglyph|Heiroglyph (Balatro)]] and [[Petroglyph|Petroglyph (Balatro)]] reduces the current [[Ante|Ante (Balatro)]] by 1, allowing for more [[rounds|round (Balatro)]] to generate cards through Certificate. However, Petroglyph's reduced Discards go against generated Purple Seals.;;<<hr2Poker handshr2>>Most [[poker hands|poker hands (Balatro)]] will not be boosted because of the random nature of generated cards, with [[High Card|High Card (Balatro)]] and [[Pair|Pair (Balatro)]] as the safest bets when using Certificate. Decks relying on [[Flushes|Flush (Balatro)]] and [[Straights|Straight (Balatro)]] may be adversely affected by random cards with Suits and Ranks that go against potential [[deck fixing|deck fixing (Balatro)]].<<hr2Jokershr2>>Certificate's randomness can both be a blessing and a curse, generating great Seals aligned with held Jokers or generating Seals that go against the build. With only 4 Seals, the odds of getting a specific Seal are the same as using a [[Wheel|The Wheel of Fortune (Balatro)]] every Blind. If Certificate is obtained early enough in the [[run|run (Balatro)]], eventually multiple favorable Seals will be generated.;;[[Blueprint|Blueprint (Balatro)]] and [[Brainstorm|Brainstorm (Balatro)]] are likely the best Jokers for Certificate, generating extra Sealed cards at the start of a Blind while also being able to be used on other Jokers when it is time to score.|[[Hologram|Hologram (Balatro)]] gains X0.25 Mult for every playing card added to the deck, effectively giving a minimum of a free X0.25 Mult every Blind.|[[Flash Card|Flash Card (Balatro)]], [[Red Card|Red Card (Balatro)]], [[Bull|Bull (Balatro)]], and [[Bootstraps|Bootstraps (Balatro)]] all benefit from the money generated through Gold Seals. A Gold Seal on a Gold Card would pair well with a [[Golden Ticket]], adding additional money generation. Cards that [[retrigger|retrigger (Balatro)]] effects, such as [[Dusk|Dusk (Balatro)]], [[Hack|Hack (Balatro)]], [[Seltzer|Seltzer (Balatro)]], [[Hanging Chad|Hanging Chad (Balatro)]], and [[Sock and Buskin]], increase the value of Gold Seals drastically and pair well with money-focused Jokers. [[The Hermit|The Hermit (Balatro)]] and [[Temperance|Temperance (Balatro)]], which can be generated through Purple Seals, can also be used to help synergize with these Jokers.|[[Constellation|Constellation (Balatro)]] can be greatly boosted by the up to 3 Planet cards generated per Blind through Blue Seals, with a best-case scenario of X0.3 added every Blind. This, in combination with the value of Planet cards, can allow for a strong mid-to-late game scaling.|[[Fortune Teller|Fortune Teller (Balatro)]] benefits from generated Purple Seals, increasing the Mult for solid early-to-mid game scaling. When paired with [[Vampire|Vampire (Balatro)]], who benefits from [[Enhancments|Enhancements (Balatro)]] that can be generated through Tarot Cards, it creates a solid base that can be used for later Blinds.|Jokers relying or specific Suits or Ranks may benefit or be harmed by the randomly generated cards through Certificate, such as [[Wee Joker|Wee Joker (Balatro)]], [[Bloodstone|Bloodstone (Balatro)]], and [[Photograph|Photograph (Balatro)]]. Certificate can be quite valuable when lucky, but there is a 1 in 4 chance to get a specific Suit and a much worse 1 in 13 chance to get a specific Rank. Tarot cards generated through Purple Seals can aid in deck fixing, but it overall is risky to build around Certificate.|[[Throwback|Throwback (Balatro)]], which incentivizes skipping Blinds, reduces the number of generated cards through Certificate.|[[Erosion|Erosion (Balatro)]] doesn't work well with Certificate because of Certificate's card generation going against the +4 Mult for every fewer card than 52 in a deck.;;</div>
