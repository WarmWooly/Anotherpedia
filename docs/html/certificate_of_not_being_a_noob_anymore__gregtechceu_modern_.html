      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Epic||Stack size|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|No||Tooltip text|Challenge&spAccepted!info>>The Certificate of Not Being a Noob Anymore is an item in the Minecraft mod GregTechCEu Modern from extruding blocks of neutronium. The only purpose it serves is for bragging rights. While the process can technically be started with ULV, it would take 3.4 years for the certificate to be finished. By the time the player can produce neutronium with a fusion reactor, they will be at ZPM, with an elite extruder III taking only 19.4 days to make the certificate.



In an extruder, 128 blocks of neutronium can be extruded into a Certificate of Not Being a Noob Anymore. The process requires 15,032,385,529 EU 107,374,184 seconds (7 EU/t) on ULV.<<note(content=This represents the minumum voltage tier to complete the process, with each additional tier halving the time and quadrupling the power used per tick.(text=noteCountnote>></div>
