Chain conveyors require 1 industrial belts (Not Lazy Chainmail), 2 carpets (Not Lazy Chainmail) of the same material, 2 redstone dust (Minecraft), and 1 redstone torch (Minecraft) to crafting (Minecraft) (place the industrial belt in the middle, the carpets to the left and right, the redstone in the bottom corners, and the torch in the middle-bottom slot; makes 16). Adding spikes to the chain conveyors requires 3 chain conveyors and 6 nuggets of the same material (place the conveyors at the bottom row of the grid, fill the rest with copper nuggets; makes 3).



Chain conveyors are used in the following crafting (Minecraft) recipes:<br>Conveyor Warper (Not Lazy Chainmail) - 2 chain conveyors, 1 telemagnetic alloy (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 2 iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail) (place the telemagnetic alloy in the middle, then the iron composite above and below, and the conveyors to the left and right).<br>Sort Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) x4 - 1 chain conveyor, 1 dropper (Minecraft), and 1 crude engine (Not Lazy Chainmail) (place the dropper in the middle, with the engine below and the conveyor above).

When a mob (Minecraft) or item (Minecraft) is on the conveyor, it will move in the direction facing. As it is spiked, mobs will also Bleeding (Not Lazy Chainmail) while riding the conveyor. If powered by redstone (Minecraft), the conveyor will stop moving mobs/items. If a player (Not Lazy Chainmail) rides a conveyor with a speed of 4 or greater (rose gold chain conveyor (Not Lazy Chainmail) or better) they will be granted the advancement (Minecraft) Look Ma, No Hands! (Not Lazy Chainmail) and if a player rides a waxed weathered copper spiked chain conveyor (Not Lazy Chainmail) they will be granted the advancement What a Mouthful! (Not Lazy Chainmail)
