The following is information on chain conveyors:<<tableType|Speed|Bleeding||Oxidized (Spiked, Waxed, Both)|r0|I for 0.5 seconds||Weathered (Spiked, Waxed, Both)|r0.5|I for 1 second||Exposed (Spiked, Waxed, Both)|r0.75|I for 2 seconds||Copper (Spiked, Waxed, Both)|r1|I for 3 seconds||Iron (Spiked)|r1.5|I for 5 seconds||Gold (Spiked)|r2|II for 5 seconds||Rose gold (Spiked)|r4|III for 5 seconds||Netherite (Spiked)|r8|V for 5 seconds||Iron composite (Spiked)|r16|VIII for 2 secondstable>>



Chain conveyors require 1 industrial belt, 2 carpets of the same material, 2 redstone dust, and 1 redstone torch to craft (place the industrial belt in the middle, the carpets to the left and right, the redstone in the bottom corners, and the torch in the middle-bottom slot; makes 16). Adding spikes to the chain conveyors requires 3 chain conveyors and 6 nuggets of the same material<<note(content=Iron nuggets, gold nuggets, copper nuggets, rose gold nuggets, and iron composite nuggets for their respective materials. For netherite, place 3 netherite fragments in the middle row and fill the remaining row with gold nuggets.(text=noteCountnote>> (place the conveyors at the bottom row of the grid, fill the rest with copper nuggets; makes 3).



Chain conveyors are used in the following crafting recipes:&spConveyor Warper - 2 chain conveyors, 1 telemagnetic alloy, and 2 iron composite ingots (place the telemagnetic alloy in the middle, then the iron composite above and below, and the conveyors to the left and right).&spSort Dropper x4 - 1 chain conveyor, 1 dropper, and 1 crude engine (place the dropper in the middle, with the engine below and the conveyor above).

When a mob or item is on the conveyor, it will move in the direction facing. As it is spiked, mobs will also Bleed while riding the conveyor. If powered by redstone, the conveyor will stop moving mobs/items. If a player rides a conveyor with a speed of 4 or greater (rose gold or better) they will be granted the advancement Look Ma, No Hands! and if a player rides a waxed weathered copper spiked chain conveyor they will be granted the advancement What a Mouthful!
