  <h1>Chain Generator (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|5||hardness (Minecraft)|2||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|No||Power storage|200000 FEinfo>>The chain generator is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to turn chain links into Forge Energy (Minecraft modding) (FE). FE is not used in any blocks/items in Not Lazy Chainmail, but rather made for cross-compatibility with mods that do use FE or other power systems.
The chain generator can be crafting (Minecraft) with 5 cobblestone (Minecraft), 2 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 recycler (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 1 crude engine (Not Lazy Chainmail) (place the recycler in the middle, then the ingots to the left and right and the engine on the bottom; fill the rest of the grid with cobblestone).
The chain generator requires an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better belts increasing the speed the chain generator can convert chains to FE. The following table is based on a chain generator with an iron composite chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) constantly fed chain links:<<tableMaterial|Power||Copper chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|{{r5 FE/tick (Minecraft)||Iron chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|{{r15 FE/t||Gold chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|{{r25 FE/t||Rose gold chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|{{r40 FE/t||Netherite chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|{{r200 FE/t||Iron composite chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|{{r500 FE/ttable>></div>
