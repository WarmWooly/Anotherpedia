  <h1>Chain Launcher ({{iNot Lazy Chainmail}})</h1>
  <div><<shortPlayer-launching item in {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}}short>><<info<<img(src=git/chain launcher nlc.png(cap=A chain launcher on a [[block of gold chains|block of gold chains (Not Lazy Chainmail)]].img>>||{{bStats}}||{{b[[Rarity|Rarity (Minecraft)]]}}|Common||{{b[[Stack size|Stack size (Minecraft)]]}}|1||{{b[[Fire/lava&spresistance|Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)]]}}|Noinfo>>The {{bchain launcher}} is an [[item|item (Minecraft)]] in the {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[mod|mod (Minecraft)]] {{i[[Not Lazy Chainmail]]}} used for [[player|player (Minecraft)]] traversal though being launched.<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>The chain launcher can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]] with 1 [[lever|lever (Minecraft)]], 1 [[piston|piston (Minecraft)]], 1 [[chain|chain (Minecraft)]], 4 [[blocks of iron chains|block of iron chains (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and 1 [[spool block|spool block (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (place the piston in the center, the chain to the right, the spool block to the left, the lever in the bottom left corner, and fill the top, bottom, and right corners with blocks of iron chains).<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Launchinghr2>><<img(src=git/chain launcher held nlc.png(cap=A held chain launcher.img>>The chain launcher can be used to launch in the direction the player is facing. Using the launcher puts it on [[cooldown|cooldown (Minecraft)]]. The chain launcher has multiple interactions and [[enchantments|enchantment (Minecraft)]] that change how the chain launcher can be used.<<hr3Boostinghr3>>By holding a [[vinegar bottle|vinegar bottle (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] in the [[offhand|offhand (Minecraft)]], the launch power is increased by 214.3%, "boosting" the launch. An empty [[glass bottle|glass bottle (Minecraft)]] will be placed in the inventory (or dropped if full) on use. Boosting while airborne (with the [[Ascension|Ascension (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] enchantment) will award the player the [[advancement|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Flight in All but Name|Flight in All but Name (Not Lazy Chainmail)]].<<hr3Rope launchinghr3>>By holding a [[rope|ropes (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] in the offhand, the rope will be launched from the launcher instead of boosting the player. If the rope hits a [[block|block (Minecraft)]], it will act as if it has been placed and create a climbable rope. If the rope hits a [[mob|mob (Minecraft)]], it will deal significant damage and drop as an item on the ground. The following ropes are ordered from weakest to strongest: [[copper rope|copper rope (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], [[iron rope|iron rope (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], [[gold rope|gold rope (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], [[rose gold rope|rose gold rope (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], [[netherite rope|netherite rope (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and [[iron composite rope|iron composite rope (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]. Hitting a mob with an iron composite rope will award the advancement [[Evildoers, Beware!|Evildoers, Beware! (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]<<hr3Mob launchinghr3>><<img(src=git/chain launcher punching nlc.gif(cap=A [[creeper|creeper (Minecraft)]] getting boosted away.img>>By [[punching|punch (Minecraft)]] a [[mob|mob (Minecraft)]] with a chain launcher, they will be flung in the direction the attacker is facing. This action can also be boosted with a vinegar bottle, and will award the player the advancement [[We're Blasting Off Again!|We're Blasting Off Again! (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] As launching other mobs is quite powerful, to compensate, the cooldown is x5 as long as performing the self-propelled equivalents. Ropes will not be launched when punching mobs.<<hr3Bucket launchinghr3>>By holding a bucket with a mob ([[cod|bucket of cod (Minecraft)]], [[salmon|bucket of salmon (Minecraft)]], [[tropical fish|bucket of tropical fish (Minecraft)]], [[pufferfish|bucket of pufferfish (Minecraft)]], [[axolotl|bucket of axolotl (Minecraft)]], or [[tadpole|bucket of tadpole (Minecraft)]]) in the offhand, the mob in the bucket will be flung out. The bucket in the offhand will become a [[water bucket|water bucket (Minecraft)]].<<hr3Fireball launchinghr3>>By holding a [[fire charge|fire charge (Minecraft)]] in the offhand, it will release a [[small fireball|small fireball (Minecraft)]] (as if shot by a [[dispenser|dispenser (Minecraft)]]).<<hr3Potion launchinghr3>>By holding a [[splash|splash potion (Minecraft)]] or [[lingering potion|lingering potion (Minecraft)]] in the offhand, it will shoot out the potion. Launching potions does not affect the potion's duration or quality.<<hr3End crystal launchinghr3>>By holding an [[end crystal|end crystal (Minecraft)]] in the offhand, a projectile will be launched out that will place an end crystal when it lands. It will place an end crystal regardless of landing on the ground or hitting a mob. Because of how powerful the launching end crystals can be, it has a x2.5 longer cooldown compared to other projectiles.<<hr3Loose material launchinghr3>>By holding a [[loose stone|loose stone (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], a [[loose deepened stone|loose deepened stone (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], or a [[mudball|mudball (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], a projectile will be launched out of the corresponding material. Loose stones deal damage, break [[glass|glass (Minecraft)]], and drop on the ground. Loose deepened stones deal more damage than loose stones. If a player increases their Rockiness with [[rocky leather paddings|rocky leather padding (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], loose stones have increased damage. Mudballs deal no damage and do not drop on the ground, but they do give hit mobs [[Slowness|Slowness (Minecraft)]] and [[Blindness|Blindness (Minecraft)]] for 5 seconds. They only have half the cooldown compared to other projectiles.<<hr3Cooldownhr3>>[[Cooldown|cooldown (Minecraft)]] is dependent on enchantments and the action performed. The following table shows the cooldown time for actions:<<table{{bAction}}|{{bTime (sec)}}|{{bWith [[Dexterous|Dexterous (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]}}||Lauching|{{r1.0}}|{{r0.25}}||Boosting|{{r1.5}}|{{r0.40}}||Rope Launching|{{r2.0}}|{{r0.50}}||Mob Launching|{{r5.0}}|{{r1.25}}||Boosted Mob Launching|{{r7.5}}|{{r1.90}}||Bucket Launching|{{r2.0}}|{{r0.50}}||Fireball Launching|{{r2.0}}|{{r0.50}}||Potion Launching|{{r2.0}}|{{r0.50}}||End Crystal Launching|{{r5.0}}|{{r1.25}}||Loose Material Launching|{{r1.0}}|{{r0.25}}table>><<hr3Distancehr3>><<img(src=git/chain launcher distance nlc.png(cap=The varying launch heights using the chain launcher.img>>Depending on if the launcher is enchanted and/or boosted, the distance that the player will be launched changes. The following are the launch distances when launching straight upward:<<table{{bAction}}|{{bDistance}}|{{bWith [[Acceleration|Acceleration (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]}}||Launching|{{r7 blocks}}|{{r15 blocks}}||Boosting|{{r29 blocks}}|{{r57 blocks}}table>><<hr2Rune castinghr2>>There are 4 chain launcher-exclusive [[runes|runes (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] that can be added, which are:&sp[[Acceleration Rune|Acceleration Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - Applies [[Acceleration|Acceleration (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (increases launch power by 150%), costing 3 [[levels|experience (Minecraft)]].&sp[[Ascension Rune|Ascension Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - Applies [[Ascension|Ascension (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (allows launching while not grounded), costing 12 levels.&sp[[Dexerous Rune|Dexterous Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - Applies [[Dexterous|Dexterous (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (decreases cooldown by 75%, rounding up), costing 2 levels.&sp[[Featherweight Rune|Featherweight Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - Applies [[Featherweight|Featherweight (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (while held and [[sneaking|sneaking (Minecraft)]], applies [[slow falling|slow falling (Minecraft)]]), costing 5 levels.</div>
