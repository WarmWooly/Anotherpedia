      <h1>Chain Launcher (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The chain launcher is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used for player traversal though being launched.



The chain launcher can be crafted with 1 lever, 1 piston, 1 chain, 4 blocks of iron chains, and 1 spool block (place the piston in the center, the chain to the right, the spool block to the left, the lever in the bottom left corner, and fill the top, bottom, and right corners with blocks of iron chains).



The chain launcher can be used to launch in the direction the player is facing. Using the launcher puts it on cooldown. The chain launcher has multiple interactions and enchantments that change how the chain launcher can be used.

By holding a vinegar bottle in the offhand, the launch power is increased by 214.3%, "boosting" the launch. An empty glass bottle will be placed in the inventory (or dropped if full) on use. Boosting while airborne (with the Ascension enchantment) will award the player the advancement Flight in All but Name.

By holding a rope in the offhand, the rope will be launched from the launcher instead of boosting the player. If the rope hits a block, it will act as if it has been placed and create a climbable rope. If the rope hits a mob, it will deal significant damage and drop as an item on the ground. The following ropes are ordered from weakest to strongest: copper rope, iron rope, gold rope, rose gold rope, netherite rope, and iron composite rope. Hitting a mob with an iron composite rope will award the advancement Evildoers, Beware!

By punching a mob with a chain launcher, they will be flung in the direction the attacker is facing. This action can also be boosted with a vinegar bottle, and will award the player the advancement We're Blasting Off Again! As launching other mobs is quite powerful, to compensate, the cooldown is x5 as long as performing the self-propelled equivalents. Ropes will not be launched when punching mobs.

By holding a bucket with a mob (cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish, axolotl, or tadpole) in the offhand, the mob in the bucket will be flung out. The bucket in the offhand will become a water bucket.

By holding a fire charge in the offhand, it will release a small fireball (as if shot by a dispenser).

By holding a splash or lingering potion in the offhand, it will shoot out the potion. Launching potions does not affect the potion's duration or quality.

By holding an end crystal in the offhand, a projectile will be launched out that will place an end crystal when it lands. It will place an end crystal regardless of landing on the ground or hitting a mob. Because of how powerful the launching end crystals can be, it has a x2.5 longer cooldown compared to other projectiles.

By holding a loose stone, a loose deepened stone, or a mudball, a projectile will be launched out of the corresponding material. Loose stones deal damage, break glass, and drop on the ground. Loose deepened stones deal more damage than loose stones. If a player increases their Rockiness with rocky leather paddings, loose stones have increased damage. Mudballs deal no damage and do not drop on the ground, but they do give hit mobs Slowness and Blindness for 5 seconds. They only have half the cooldown compared to other projectiles.

Cooldown is dependent on enchantments and the action performed. The following table shows the cooldown time for actions:<<tableAction|Time (sec)|With Dexterous||Lauching|r1.0|r0.25||Boosting|r1.5|r0.40||Rope Launching|r2.0|r0.50||Mob Launching|r5.0|r1.25||Boosted Mob Launching|r7.5|r1.90||Bucket Launching|r2.0|r0.50||Fireball Launching|r2.0|r0.50||Potion Launching|r2.0|r0.50||End Crystal Launching|r5.0|r1.25||Loose Material Launching|r1.0|r0.25table>>

Depending on if the launcher is enchanted and/or boosted, the distance that the player will be launched changes. The following are the launch distances when launching straight upward:<<tableAction|Distance|With Acceleration||Launching|r7 blocks|r15 blocks||Boosting|r29 blocks|r57 blockstable>>

There are 4 chain launcher-exclusive runes that can be added, which are:<br>Acceleration Rune - Applies Acceleration (increases launch power by 150%), costing 3 levels.<br>Ascension Rune - Applies Ascension (allows launching while not grounded), costing 12 levels.<br>Dexerous Rune - Applies Dexterous (decreases cooldown by 75%, rounding up), costing 2 levels.<br>Featherweight Rune - Applies Featherweight (while held and sneaking, applies slow falling), costing 5 levels.</div>
