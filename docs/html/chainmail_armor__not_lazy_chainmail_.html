      <h1>Chainmail armor (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Chainmail armor is a category of armor in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. Chainmail armor is comprised of chain links with a chainmail project. Unlike normal armors, chainmail armor can have leather paddings applied to them to increase their stats and apply unique buffs. There are six types of chainmail armor: iron, gold, copper, netherite, rose gold, and iron composite.

The following table shows the variable stats between items (helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots), with the number in bold being for a whole set (besides enchantability, which is constant for every piece).<<tablec{{bMaterial}}|c{{bArmor}}|c{{bAT}}|c{{bKR}}|c{{bDur.}}|c{{bEnch.}}||c{{bIron}}|c{{b12<br>2<br>5<br>4<br>1}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b825<br>165<br>240<br>225<br>195}}|c{{b12||c{{bGold}}|c{{b10<br>2<br>4<br>3<br>1}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b550<br>110<br>160<br>150<br>130}}|c{{b30||c{{bCopper}}|c{{b11<br>2<br>4<br>4<br>1}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b825<br>165<br>240<br>225<br>195}}|c{{b15||c{{bNetherite}}|c{{b18<br>3<br>7<br>5<br>3}}|c{{b12<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3}}|c{{b8<br>2<br>2<br>2<br>2}}|c{{b1760<br>352<br>512<br>480<br>416}}|c{{b20||c{{bRose Gold}}|c{{b16<br>3<br>6<br>5<br>2}}|c{{b4<br>1<br>1<br>1<br>1}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b1100<br>220<br>320<br>300<br>260}}|c{{b25||c{{bIron Composite}}|c{{b22<br>4<br>8<br>6<br>4}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0}}|c{{b2475<br>495<br>720<br>675<br>585}}|c{{b12table>>

For detailed information regarding how to get normal (iron) chainmail armor, see chainmail armor ({{aiMinecraft).}}

All chainmail armor can be obtained through maille crafting, with the item produced based on the material of chain link used. Helmets require 320 chain links, chestplates require 512, leggings require 448, and boots require 256.

The iron chainmail helemt, iron chainmail chestplate, gold chainmail helmet, and gold chainmail chestplate each have a 7.69% chance to appear in a suspicious sand within a chainmail ruins.



Main page: Armor ({{aiMinecraft)}}<br>Chainmail armor can be equipped to the four armor slots: head, chest, legs, and feet. Only one of each may be applied at a time. Chainmail armor can be manually placed in the slot or automatically swapped by using the armor in the main hand/offhand. While the player is wearing at least one gold or rose gold chainmail armor piece, piglins will be neutral instead of hostile. This effect does not apply to piglin brutes.

In a leathersmithing table, up to 3 leather paddings can be applied to chainmail armor. Leather paddings will change the stats on the piece, increasing various stats dependent on the applied padding. Leather paddings are lost when chainmail armor breaks or is crushed

Chainmail armor can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Binding, Curse of Vanishing, Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Thorns, Aqua Affinity, Respiration, Swift Sneak, Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider, and Soul Speed using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking, Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Thorns, Aqua Affinity, Respiration, Feather Falling, Frost Walker, and Depth Strider may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

Chainmail armor can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining two pieces of the same chainmail armor will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the two chainmail pieces, costing experience.

In an anvil, chainmail armor can be repaired using its corresponding ingot (iron, gold, copper, netherite, rose gold, or iron composite), costing experience and restoring 25% of the peice's durability, rounded down.

The rune Chain Repair Rune can be applied to chainmail armor, costing 3 levels with the max Chain Repair level at IV. 

In a smithing table, armor trims can be applied to chainmail armor with a material (amethyst, chromatic, copper, diamond, emerald, gold, iron, iron composite, lapis lazuli, nether quartz, netherite, redstone dust, rose gold, and telemagnetic alloy) to add a trim to the armor. Trims are purely cosmetic, with their coloration based on the material used.

Chainmail armor can be crushed into an unfinished project of its corresponding material, which can be snipped to recover all the chain links used to make it.

Iron chainmail armor can be smelted in a furnace or a blast furnace to produce an iron nugget, taking 10 and 5 seconds respectively.</div>
