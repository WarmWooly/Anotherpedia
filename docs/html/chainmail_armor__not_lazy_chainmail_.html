Main page: Armor ({{aiMinecraft)}}<br>Chainmail armor can be equipped to the four armor slots: head, chest, legs, and feet. Only one of each may be applied at a time. Chainmail armor can be manually placed in the slot or automatically swapped by using the armor in the main hand (Minecraft)/offhand (Minecraft).
