      <h1>Chainmail Project (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The chainmail project is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used for maille crafting chains into chainmail.



Chainmail projects can be crafted using 1 paper and 8 sticks (surround the paper with the sticks).



The main use for chainmail projects is to turn chains into chainmail. When shift-right-clicked, the chainmail project's settings menu will appear, allowing for the material and project to be changed. If this menu is opened while in the middle of a project, a button to scrap the project will be offered. Iron, gold, copper, netherite, rose gold, and iron composite chain links can be selected using the corresponding ingot buttons under "Material". The following are the projects that can be made using a chainmail project:<<tableProject|# of chains|Iron|Gold|Copper|Netherite|Rose gold|Iron composite||Helmet|r320|Helm|Helm|Helm|Helm|Helm|Helm||Chestplate|r512|Chest|Chest|Chest|Chest|Chest|Chest||Leggings|r448|Leg|Leg|Leg|Leg|Leg|Leg||Boots|r256|Boots|Boots|Boots|Boots|Boots|Boots||Chain|r8|Chain|Chain|Chain|Chain|Chain|Chain||Industrial Belt|r256|I-Belt|I-Belt|I-Belt|I-Belt|I-Belt|I-Belt||Bracelet|r64|Brace|Brace|Brace|Brace|Brace|Brace||Necklace|r128|Neck|Neck|Neck|Neck|Neck|Neck||Gloves|r192|Glove|Glove|Glove|Glove|Glove|Glove||Belt|r128|Belt|Belt|Belt|Belt|Belt|Belt||Tool Chain|r192|Tool|Tool|Tool|Tool|Tool|Tool||Music Disc|r32|Disc|Disc|Disc|Disc|Disc|Disctable>><br>When the chainmail project is right-clicked, it will add a chain to the project. Information about the current project will be displayed to the right of the crosshair, including the item, chains added, and remaining chains. Chains of the correct material will automatically be taken from the inventory and added to the project when right-clicked. There is a 1 in 64 chance per chain added that 1 hunger will be consumed (unless the chainmail project is enchanted with Hunger Endurance). When the project is finished, the item will be added to the inventory (or dropped on the ground if the inventory is full). The chainmail project is not consumed and can be used an unlimited number of times.

The Auto Mailler is a block that can be used to automatically maille craft items. By inputting a chainmail project, an industrial belt, and chain links, the project will be automatically completed. The chainmail project can be taken out, even if incomplete, and continued to be worked on manually, and vice versa.

The following advancements can be obtained through maille crafting:<br>It's Not Lazy - Maille craft a chainmail helmet, chestplate, leggings, or boots.<br>Craft Like a Billionaire - Maille craft a chain.<br>Upgrades, People, Upgrades! - Maille craft an iron, copper, or gold chainmail industrial belt.<br>Gotta Go Fast - Mallie craft an iron composite chainmail industrial belt.<br>Musically Inclined - Maille craft a music disc.

As players may misclick and add chains to a project, or change their minds and wish to start a new project, they can recover the spent chains by resetting the chainmail project. A menu to reset the project will appear when shift-right-clicked mid-project (with one or more chain links already added). By pressing the "Reset" button, the chainmail project will be reset and an unfinished project will be created. The unfinished project can be snipped in the same manner to collect chain links from coils, and none of the chains will be lost in the process.

Chainmail projects are used in the following melding recipes:<br>Chain Repair Rune - 1 chainmail project, 1 redstone dust, and 1 smooth stone

Multiple runes can be cast onto chainmail projects:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Hunger Endurance Rune|Hunger Endurance|r2 levels|I||Nimble Rune|Nimble|r4 levels|IItable>>

In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 chainmail project can fuel for 40 seconds (4 items).</div>
