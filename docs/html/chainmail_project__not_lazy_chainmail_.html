Chains of the correct material will automatically be taken from the inventory and added to the project when right-clicked. There is a 1 in 64 chance per chain added that 1 [[hunger|hunger (Minecraft)]] will be consumed (unless the chainmail project is enchanted with [[Hunger Endurance|Hunger Endurance (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]). When the project is finished, the item will be added to the inventory (or dropped on the ground if the inventory is full).

By pressing the "Reset" button, the chainmail project will be reset and an [[unfinished project|unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] will be created. The unfinished project can be [[snipped|Snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] in the same manner to collect chain links from [[coils|coils (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and none of the chains will be lost in the process.<<hr2Meldinghr2>>Chainmail projects are used in the following [[melding|Melder]] recipes:&sp[[Chain Repair Rune|Chain Repair Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - 1 chainmail project, 1 [[redstone dust|redstone dust (Minecraft)]], and 1 [[smooth stone|smooth stone (Minecraft)]]<<hr2Rune castinghr2>>Multiple [[runes|runes (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be cast onto chainmail projects:<<table{{bRune}}|{{bEnchantment}}|{{bLevel cost}}|{{bMax level}}||[[Hunger Endurance Rune|Hunger Endurance Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Hunger Endurance|Hunger Endurance (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r2 levels}}|I||[[Nimble Rune|Nimble Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Nimble|Nimble (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r4 levels}}|IItable>><<hr2Fuelhr2>>In a [[furnace|furnace (Minecraft)]], [[blast furnace|blast furnace (Minecraft)]], or [[smoker|smoker (Minecraft)]], 1 chainmail project can fuel for 40 [[seconds|second]] (4 items).</div>
