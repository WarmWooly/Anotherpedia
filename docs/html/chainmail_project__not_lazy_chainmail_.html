      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The chainmail project is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used for maille crafting chains into chainmail.



Chainmail projects can be crafting (Minecraft) using 1 paper (Minecraft) and 8 stick (Minecraft) (surround the paper with the sticks).



The main use for chainmail projects is to turn chains into chainmail. When shift-right-clicked, the chainmail project's settings menu will appear, allowing for the material and project to be changed. If this menu is opened while in the middle of a project, a button to scrap the project will be offered. Iron chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail), gold chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail), copper chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail), netherite chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail), rose gold chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail), and iron composite chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail) chain links (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be selected using the corresponding ingot buttons under "Material". The following are the projects that can be made using a chainmail project:<<tableProject|# of chains|Iron chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose gold chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron composite chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Hemlets (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r320|Chainmail Helmet (Minecraft)|Gold Chainmail Helmet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Helmet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Helmet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Helmet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Helmet (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Chestplates (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r512|Chainmail Chestplate (Minecraft)|Gold Chainmail Chestplate (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Chestplate (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Chestplate (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Chestplate (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Chestplate (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Leggings (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r448|Chainmail Leggings (Minecraft)|Gold Chainmail Leggings (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Leggings (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Leggings (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Leggings (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Leggings (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Boots (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r256|Chainmail Boots (Minecraft)|Gold Chainmail Boots (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Boots (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Boots (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Boots (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Boots (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Chains (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r8|Chain (Minecraft)|Gold Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Industrial Belts (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r256|Iron Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Bracelets (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r64|Iron Chainmail Bracelet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Chainmail Bracelet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Bracelet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Bracelet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Bracelet (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Bracelet (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Necklaces (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r128|Iron Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r192|Iron Chainmail Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Chainmail Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Gloves (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Belts (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r128|Iron Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Tool Chains (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r192|Iron Tool Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Tool Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Tool Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Tool Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Tool Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Tool Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)||Music Discs (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r32|Music Disc Attack of the Roombas (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Music Disc Bounce (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Music Disc Company (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Music Disc Boss (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Music Disc Tired (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Music Disc Super Beats (Not Lazy Chainmail)table>><br>When the chainmail project is right-clicked, it will add a chain to the project. Information about the current project will be displayed to the right of the crosshair, including the item, chains added, and remaining chains. Chains of the correct material will automatically be taken from the inventory and added to the project when right-clicked. Each chain added will decrease hunger (Minecraft) (unless the chainmail project is enchanted with Hunger Endurance (Not Lazy Chainmail)). When the project is finished, the item will be added to the inventory (or dropped on the ground if the inventory is full). The chainmail project is not consumed and can be used an unlimited number of times.

The Auto Mailler (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically maille craft items. By inputting a chainmail project, an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), and chain links, the project will be automatically completed. The chainmail project can be taken out, even if incomplete, and continued to be worked on manually, and vice versa.

The following advancement (Minecraft) can be obtained through maille crafting:<br>It's Not Lazy (Not Lazy Chainmail) - Maille craft a chainmail helmet (Minecraft), chainmail chestplate (Minecraft), chainmail leggings (Minecraft), or chainmail boots (Minecraft).<br>Craft Like a Billionaire (Not Lazy Chainmail) - Maille craft a chain (Minecraft).<br>Upgrades, People, Upgrades! (Not Lazy Chainmail) - Maille craft an iron chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), copper chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), or gold chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail).<br>Gotta Go Fast (Not Lazy Chainmail) - Mallie craft an iron composite chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail).<br>Musically Inclined (Not Lazy Chainmail) - Maille craft a music discs (Not Lazy Chainmail).

As players may misclick and add chains to a project, or change their minds and wish to start a new project, they can recover the spent chains by resetting the chainmail project. A menu to reset the project will appear when shift-right-clicked mid-project (with one or more chain links already added). By pressing the "Reset" button, the chainmail project will be reset and an unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail) will be created. The unfinished project can be Snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) in the same manner to collect chain links from coils (Not Lazy Chainmail), and none of the chains will be lost in the process.

Chainmail projects are used in the following Melder recipes:<br>Chain Repair Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail) - 1 chainmail project, 1 redstone dust (Minecraft), and 1 smooth stone (Minecraft)

Multiple runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast onto chainmail projects:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Hunger Endurance Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Hunger Endurance (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2 levels|I||Nimble Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Nimble (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r4 levels|II||Dampen Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Dampened (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|I||Muffle Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Muffled (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|Itable>>
