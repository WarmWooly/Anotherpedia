      <h1>Chainsaw (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|350||Enchantability|2||Harvest level|3||Efficiency|10||Attack damage|5||Attack speed|0.7||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Noinfo>>The chainsaw is an axe in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail exclusively used for mining wood much faster. Unlike normal axes in Minecraft, the chainsaw is a poor weapon, attacking slower and dealing less damage than an axe. However, the chainsaw can still disable shields.



The chainsaw can be crafted with 1 crude engine, 1 iron chainmail industrial belt, 1 iron ingot, and 2 iron nuggets (place the iron ingot in the middle, the engine to the left, the nuggets in the two slots below the engine and ingot, and the belt in the top right corner).



Chainsaws can be used to mine wood blocks (i.e. logs, planks) faster than other tools. Each block broken will cost 1 durability.

Using the chainsaw on logs, wood, or blocks of bamboo will strip it into its stripped log, stripped wood, or block of stripped bamboo varients. This action costs 1 durability

Using the chainsaw on an oxidized or waxed copper block will reduce the oxidation by 1 level or remove the wax through scraping. This action costs 1 durability.

Chainsaws are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. The chainsaw deals 5 damage and has an attack cooldown of 0.7 (~1.43 seconds or ~29 ticks). The chainsaw will also apply the effect Bleeding I for 5 seconds. If the attacked mob is holding up a shield, it will become disabled for 5 seconds.

The chainsaw can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining chainsaws will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainsaws, costing experience. Chainsaws can be repaired in an anvil using an iron ingot, restoring 25% of the chainsaw's durability, rounded down.

Chainsaws can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Vanishing, Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Efficiency, Silk Touch, and Fortune using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking, Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Efficiency, Silk Touch, and Fortune may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

Multiple runes can be cast onto chainswords:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Experienced Rune|Experienced|r10 levels|III||Locating Rune|Locating|r2 levels|I||Shatter Rune|Shatter|r4 levels|I||Tracking Rune|Tracking|r3 levels|Itable>></div>
