Unlike normal axes in {{iMinecraft}}, the chainsaw is a poor [[weapon|weapons (Minecraft)]], attacking slower and dealing less damage than an axe. However, the chainsaw can still disable [[shields|shield (Minecraft)]].<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>The chainsaw can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]] with 1 [[crude engine|crude engine (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], 1 [[iron chainmail industrial belt|iron chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], 1 [[iron ingot|iron ingot (Minecraft)]], and 2 [[iron nuggets|iron nugget (Minecraft)]] (place the iron ingot in the middle, the engine to the left, the nuggets in the two slots below the engine and ingot, and the belt in the top right corner).<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Mininghr2>>Chainsaws can be used to mine wood blocks (i.e. [[logs|log (Minecraft)]], [[planks|planks (Minecraft)]]) faster than other [[tools|tool (Minecraft)]]. Each block broken will cost 1 [[durability|durability (Minecraft)]].<<note(content=Durability is not used on blocks that instantly break.(text=noteCountnote>><<hr2Strippinghr2>>Using the chainsaw on [[logs|log (Minecraft)]], [[wood|wood (Minecraft)]], or [[blocks of bamboo|block of bamboo (Minecraft)]] will [[strip|stripping (Minecraft)]] it into its [[stripped log|stripped log (Minecraft)]], [[stripped wood|stripped wood (Minecraft)]], or [[block of stripped bamboo|block of stripped bamboo (Minecraft)]] varients. This action costs 1 durability<<hr2Scrapinghr2>>Using the chainsaw on an [[oxidized|oxidization (Minecraft)]] or [[waxed|waxing (Minecraft)]] [[copper|copper (Minecraft)]] block will reduce the oxidation by 1 level or remove the wax through [[scraping|scraping (Minecraft)]]. This action costs 1 durability.<<hr2Weaponhr2>>Chainsaws are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. The chainsaw deals 5 damage and has an attack cooldown of 0.7 (~1.43 seconds or ~29 [[ticks|tick (Minecraft)]]). The chainsaw will also apply the [[effect|effect (Minecraft)]] [[Bleeding|Bleeding (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] I for 5 seconds. If the attacked mob is holding up a [[shield|shield (Minecraft)]], it will become disabled for 5 seconds.<<hr2Repairinghr2>>The chainsaw can be repaired through [[combining|combining (Minecraft)]] by [[crafting|crafting (Minecraft)]], using a [[grindstone|grindstone (Minecraft)]], or using an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]]. Combining chainsaws will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some [[experience|experience (Minecraft)]] returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainsaws, costing experience. Chainsaws can be repaired in an anvil using an [[iron ingot|iron ingot (Minecraft)]], restoring 25% of the chainsaw's durability, rounded down.<<hr2Enchantinghr2>>Chainsaws can be [[enchanted|enchanting (Minecraft)]] with [[Unbreaking|Unbreaking (Minecraft)]], [[Mending|Mending (Minecraft)]], [[Curse of Vanishing|Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft)]], [[Sharpness|Sharpness (Minecraft)]]<<note(content=Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods are mutually exclusive.(text=noteCountnote>>, [[Smite|Smite (Minecraft)]], [[Bane of Arthropods|Bane of Arthropods (Minecraft)]], [[Efficiency|Efficiency (Minecraft)]], [[Silk Touch|Silk Touch (Minecraft)]]<<note(content=Silk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive.(text=noteCountnote>>, and [[Fortune|Fortune (Minecraft)]] using an [[enchanted book|enchanted book (Minecraft)]] on an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]].
