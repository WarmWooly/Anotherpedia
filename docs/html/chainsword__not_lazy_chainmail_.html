      <h1>Chainsword (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|2,500||Enchantability|2||Harvest level|4||Efficiency|4||Attack damage|9||Attack speed|1.6||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Yesinfo>>The chainsword is a sword in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail, acting as an upgrade for the netherite sword.



The chainsword can be crafted with 1 crude engine, 1 netherite chainmail industrial belt, 2 iron composite ingots, and 1 netherite sword, (place the sword in the middle, the iron composite to the bottom and left, the belt in the top-right corner, and the engine in the bottom-left corner). Crafting the chainsword awards the advancement Chainsword Man.



Chainswords can be used to mine bamboo, bamboo saplings, cobwebs, and other blocks faster than other tools, costing 2 durability per block broken. In Creative, the chainsword will not break blocks, but will destroy placed entities.

Chainswords are designed for combat, with each attack costing 1 durability. The chainsword deals 9 damage and has an attack cooldown of 1.6 (0.625 seconds or ~13 ticks). The chainsword will also apply the effect Bleeding I for 5 seconds. The chainsword can be used to perform sweeping attacks like other swords.

The chainsword can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining chainswords will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainswords, costing experience. Chainswords can be repaired in an anvil using a netherite ingot or iron composite ingot, restoring 25% of the chainsword's durability, rounded down.

Chainsaws can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Vanishing, Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking, Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

Multiple runes can be cast onto chainswords:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Experienced Rune|Experienced|r10 levels|III||Locating Rune|Locating|r2 levels|I||Tracking Rune|Tracking|r3 levels|Itable>></div>
