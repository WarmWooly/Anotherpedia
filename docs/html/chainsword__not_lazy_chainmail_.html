Chainswords are designed for combat, with each attack costing 1 durability. The chainsword deals 9 damage and has an attack cooldown of 1.6 (0.625 seconds or ~13 tick (Minecraft)). The chainsword will also apply the effect (Minecraft) Bleeding (Not Lazy Chainmail) I for 5 seconds. The chainsword can be used to perform Sweep attack (Minecraft) like other swords.
The chainsword can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft).
