      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|2,500||Enchantability (Minecraft)|2||Harvest level (Minecraft)|4||Efficiency|4||Attack damage (Minecraft)|9||Attack speed (Minecraft)|1.6||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Yesinfo>>The chainsword is a sword (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail, acting as an upgrade for the netherite sword (Minecraft).



The chainsword can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 crude engine (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 netherite chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), 2 iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 1 netherite sword (Minecraft), (place the sword in the middle, the iron composite to the bottom and left, the belt in the top-right corner, and the engine in the bottom-left corner). Crafting the chainsword awards the advancement (Minecraft) Chainsword Man (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Chainswords can be used to mine bamboo (Minecraft), bamboo sapling (Minecraft), cobweb (Minecraft), and other blocks faster than other tools, costing 2 durability per block broken. In Creative (Minecraft), the chainsword will not break blocks, but will destroy placed entity (Minecraft).

Chainswords are designed for combat, with each attack costing 1 durability. The chainsword deals 9 damage and has an attack cooldown of 1.6 (0.625 seconds or ~13 tick (Minecraft)). The chainsword will also apply the effect (Minecraft) Bleeding (Not Lazy Chainmail) I for 5 seconds. The chainsword can be used to perform Sweep attack (Minecraft) like other swords.

The chainsword can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining chainswords will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainswords, costing experience. Chainswords can be repaired in an anvil using a netheriteingot (Minecraft) or iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), restoring 25% of the chainsword's durability, rounded down.

Chainsaws can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), Sharpness (Minecraft), Smite (Minecraft), Bane of Arthropods (Minecraft), Knockback (Minecraft), Fire Aspect (Minecraft), Looting (Minecraft), and Sweeping Edge (Minecraft) using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking, Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).
