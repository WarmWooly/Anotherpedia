CIs spawn in a campsite outside the facility of the map (SCP: Devolved Revamp). The camp requires a level 3 keycard to enter the side gate or two players with a level 2 keycard to enter. If the facility gate is broken, players can enter the camp without a keycard. The camp is on a dirt ground with wooden fence posts surrounding it. There is a campfire and logs, around which the player can sit around the fire, and there are also multiple wooden crates surrounding the camp. There are three mini tents, one with a storage container inside that contains a special uniform for players who owned the Chaos Commander (SCP: Devolved Classic) gamepass (Roblox) in SCP: Devolved Classic. The big tent that CI spawns in contains a CI uniform and a TV that says the following:For Chaos Insurgency:<br>- you are rebels against the foundation<br>- free SCPs to gain the upper hand<br>- fight against enemy combatants<br>- recruit escaped inmates<br>- cause chaos >:)</div>
