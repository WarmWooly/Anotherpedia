      <h1>Charlie Charlie Kirky</h1>
      <div>"Charlie Charlie Kirky" is a country music-inspired meme song released by Randy Diggs and Lil Godd on December 8, 2025 making light of Charlie Kirk post-Assassination of Charlie Kirk. It also jokes about using Percocet (a "drug slang"). Its mix of odd lyrics and music production and the taboo nature of the topic increased its popularity across social media.
