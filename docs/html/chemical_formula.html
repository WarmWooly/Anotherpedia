      <h1>Chemical formula</h1>
      <div>Chemical formulas are representations of elements in a chemical. A common example is Hs-b2O, also known as water, that is comprised of 2 hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Others, such as COs-b2, Os-b3, and NaCl are also well-known examples. Others, such as Hs-b2SOs-b4, are mostly only known by their common names.</div>
