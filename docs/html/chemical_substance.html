      <h1>Chemical substance</h1>
      <div>A chemical substance is a form of matter with a uniform (same) chemical composition and chemical property. Chemical substances may be chemical element or chemical compound. A mixture is formed when multiple non-chemical reaction substances are in the same area. Chemical purity of substances are judged based on how isolated a substance is. Substances in different states of matter are the same as each other.</div>
