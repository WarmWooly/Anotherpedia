      <h1>Chemical substance</h1>
      <div>A chemical substance is a form of matter with a uniform chemical composition and properties. Chemical substances may be elements or compounds. A mixture is formed when multiple non-reactive substances are in the same area. Purity of substances are judged based on how isolated a substance is. Substances in different states of matter are the same as each other.</div>
