      <h1>Chess.com bishop name change drama</h1>
      <div>On March 14, 2025, Chess.com posted on Twitter that they are "accepting new name ideas for this piece: [the bishop]" with the sprites for the bishop on Chess.com.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/chesscom/status/1900630055677497379(text=refCountref>> This was following up a similar gag post for the rook a month prior, where responses were playful (such as "tower", "castle", and "almost queen"),<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/chesscom/status/1890148609850577401(text=refCountref>> and coincides with a post they made at the same time on Facebook.<<ref(content=link|https://www.facebook.com/chess/posts/accepting-new-name-ideas-for-this-piece/1060722309419545/(text=refCountref>> Unlike their prior name change-related post, the bishop's name change gained negative responses due to the religious nature of the piece's current name. The minor drama caused by this spread to other platforms, such as YouTube and Reddit, discussing the post and either continuing to be negative towards the idea of a name change or using it as an example for the inability to make jokes on Twitter without it being spun off as a political statement.
The responses to the post were mixed, with the majority of the drama coming from the initial backlash from the post. As the drama grew and spread, responses shifted from criticism of Chess.com to attacking those who posted negative responses.&pThe negative responses were wide in scope, including accusing Chess.com of being Jewish or atheist, saying that Christianity won't fall and that this "lost at the ballot box" (referring to the Republican sweep in the 2024 US election), questioning if Chess.com needs beginner chess lessons, that the name bishop will outlast Chess.com, and calling Chess.com woke. Other less-hostile responses included threatening to hop over to other chess platforms (such as lichess), calling the piece a bishop in solidarity,<<note(content=Some responses to change the name to 'bishop' were ironic and are not in support with the other negative statements.(text=noteCountnote>> and inserting the bishop into the body. The majority of the negative responses were from Conservatives and possibly the alt-right sources due to the anti-Liberal and antisemitic nature of many of the comments.&pResponses following the initial backlash also came in a large variety, including criticism of the political landscape on Twitter, explaining how during the evolution of chess the piece went through many name and design changes, that the piece is called different names internationally, and that Conservatives can't handle jokes. The most notable response was from the chess International Master GothamChess, using the responses to the post as an example of what is wrong with Twitter and the world, which also got a mix of supportive and antagonistic responses.&pThere were also genuine responses playing along with the theme of new name ideas for the piece, including hunter, shooter, sniper, Mr. Chess and Watch, upset guy, Zoidberg hands, mermaid, moneybox, pom-pom elf, John Cena, and gnome.<<note(content=These are only examples that are not prior names for the bishop and are not translated international names.(text=noteCountnote>> The Facebook post was more positive overall in responses, with names such as juicer, Grover, paladin, sword, name-card holder, blind spot, queen slayer, slingshot, can opener, fountain pen, pike, and long-range missile.
On March 15, 2025, the Chess.com Twitter account made a follow-up post replying to their previous one saying "please stop suggesting "bishop"... silly name.", doubling down on their original post and acting as ragebait for people who interacted negatively the first time.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/chesscom/status/1900959678969872662(text=refCountref>> Responses to this post continue being a mix of antisemitism, protective of the old name, talking about the history of the bishop, and making fun of those continuing to get angry at Chess.com.
The largest spread of the post came from the YouTuber MoistCr1TiKaL from a YouTube video titled "How This Started A War on Twitter" on March 16, 2025, discussing the drama and how Twitter is prone to having sudden outbursts by avid users regardless of if the drama is warranted.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF6o8BkQz4Y(text=refCountref>> Other videos related to the drama were also made, including JohnGamingFuntime's more direct address of the people who are getting mad over the name change,<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2aKshaH_dQ(text=refCountref>> Tatikal Templar's defense of the negative replies and response to MoistCr1TiKaL's video,<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hkrI9tj68(text=refCountref>> and Jon Del Arroz's discussion on how the post follows a trend in board games becoming more woke.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfL4t5h5kI(text=refCountref>>&pThe article "Chess.Com Proposes Changing The Name Of The "Bishop" Piece In An Attempt To Remove Christian Roots From The Game" on FandomPulse proposes that the post by Chess.com was serious in its intentions despite having a history of making various joke posts related to chess.<<ref(content=link|https://fandompulse.substack.com/p/chesscom-proposes-changing-the-name(text=refCountref>> On the Chess Stack Exchange, a person questioned why Chess.com would make a post about renaming the bishop, with the sole reply explaining how it's a joke.<<ref(content=link|https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/46779/why-are-chess-com-calling-for-the-bishop-to-be-renamed(text=refCountref>> Posts on Reddit also covered the drama, making jokes about prior and future updates to chess and dunking on people who believed that it was a genuine attempt for Chess.com to rename the bishop.<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/1jcmloz/bro_thinks_chesscom_invented_chess/(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1jcbgs2/chesscom_wants_to_erase_the_name_bishop_what_do/(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1jcrfxw/twitter_having_meltdown_over_chesscom_suggesting/(text=refCountref>></div>
