The minor [[drama|Twitter drama]] caused by this spread to other platforms, such as [[YouTube]] and [[Reddit]], discussing the post and either continuing to be negative towards the idea of a name change or using it as an example for the inability to make jokes on Twitter without it being spun off as a [[political statement]].<<hrResponseshr>><<img(src=git/chess bishop name change replies.png(cap=A mix of replies to the post.img>><<img(src=git/chess bishop name change rap battle.png(cap=A reply using a clip from the song "[[Darth Vader vs Hitler]]" of [[Adolf Hitler]] to criticize antisemitic replies.img>>The responses to the post were mixed, with the majority of the drama coming from the initial backlash from the post.

Other less-hostile responses included threatening to hop over to other [[chess platforms|online chess platform]] (such as [[lichess]]), calling the piece a bishop in solidarity,<<note(content=Some responses to change the name to 'bishop' were [[ironic]] and are not in support with the other negative statements.(text=noteCountnote>> and inserting the bishop into the body. The majority of the negative responses were from [[Conservatives|Convervative]] and possibly the [[alt-right]] sources due to the anti-[[Liberal]] and [[antisemitic]] nature of many of the comments.&pResponses following the initial backlash also came in a large variety, including criticism of the political landscape on Twitter, explaining how during the [[evolution of chess|history of chess]] the piece went through many name and design changes, that the piece is called different names internationally, and that Conservatives can't handle jokes. The most notable response was from the chess [[International Master]] [[GothamChess|Levy Rozman]], using the responses to the post as an example of what is wrong with Twitter and the world, which also got a mix of supportive and antagonistic responses.&pThere were also genuine responses playing along with the theme of new name ideas for the piece, including hunter, shooter, sniper, [[Mr. Chess and Watch|Mr. Game and Watch]], upset guy, [[Zoidberg]] hands, [[mermaid]], moneybox, pom-pom elf, [[John Cena]], and gnome.<<note(content=These are only examples that are not prior names for the bishop and are not translated international names.(text=noteCountnote>> The Facebook post was more positive overall in responses, with names such as juicer, [[Grover]], paladin, sword, name-card holder, blind spot, queen slayer, slingshot, can opener, fountain pen, pike, and long-range missile.<<hr2Follow-up posthr2>><<img(src=git/chess bishop name change follow-up.png(cap=The follow-up post on March 17, 2025.img>>On March 15, 2025, the Chess.com Twitter account made a follow-up post replying to their previous one saying "please stop suggesting "bishop"... silly name.", doubling down on their original post and acting as [[ragebait]] for people who interacted negatively the first time.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/chesscom/status/1900959678969872662(text=refCountref>> Responses to this post continue being a mix of antisemitism, protective of the old name, talking about the history of the bishop, and making fun of those continuing to get angry at Chess.com.<<hrExternal coveragehr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vF6o8BkQz4Y(cap=The video by MoistCr1TiKaL.yt>>The largest spread of the post came from the [[YouTuber]] [[MoistCr1TiKaL|Cr1TiKaL]] from a YouTube video titled "How This Started A War on Twitter" on March 16, 2025, discussing the drama and how Twitter is prone to having sudden outbursts by avid users regardless of if the drama is warranted.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF6o8BkQz4Y(text=refCountref>> Other videos related to the drama were also made, including [[JohnGamingFuntime's|JohnGamingFuntime]] more direct address of the people who are getting mad over the name change,<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2aKshaH_dQ(text=refCountref>> [[Tatikal Templar's|Tatikal Templar]] defense of the negative replies and response to MoistCr1TiKaL's video,<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hkrI9tj68(text=refCountref>> and [[Jon Del Arroz's|Jon Del Arroz]] discussion on how the post follows a trend in [[board games|board game]] becoming more [[woke]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfL4t5h5kI(text=refCountref>>&pThe article "Chess.Com Proposes Changing The Name Of The "Bishop" Piece In An Attempt To Remove Christian Roots From The Game" on [[FandomPulse]] proposes that the post by Chess.com was serious in its intentions despite having a history of making various joke posts related to chess.<<ref(content=link|https://fandompulse.substack.com/p/chesscom-proposes-changing-the-name(text=refCountref>> On the [[Chess Stack Exchange]], a person questioned why Chess.com would make a post about renaming the bishop, with the sole reply explaining how it's a joke.<<ref(content=link|https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/46779/why-are-chess-com-calling-for-the-bishop-to-be-renamed(text=refCountref>> Posts on Reddit also covered the drama, making jokes about prior and future updates to chess and dunking on people who believed that it was a genuine attempt for Chess.com to rename the bishop.<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/1jcmloz/bro_thinks_chesscom_invented_chess/(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1jcbgs2/chesscom_wants_to_erase_the_name_bishop_what_do/(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1jcrfxw/twitter_having_meltdown_over_chesscom_suggesting/(text=refCountref>></div>
