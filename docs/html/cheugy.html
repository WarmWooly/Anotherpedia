  <div><<shortSlang for outdated trendsshort>><<img(src=git/cheugy.jpg(cap=A [[comic]] by [[Jason Adam Katzenstein]] about a man who became cheugy, a play on the [[story]] [[The Metamorphosis]].img>>{{bCheugy}} is [[slang]] for a [[person]] who is out-of-date or not [[trendy]], especially when they are trying to and [[failing|failure]]. This mainly includes [[Minion memes|minion meme]] and other 2010s [[humor]].&pIt is unclear when this term was made, with a variety of sources. Some say it could have been in 2013, while others claim that it was made on the [[Urban Dictionary]] in 2018. It was repopularized in 2021 on [[TikTok]].<<safe<<hrMisogynyhr>>Around the revitalization in 2021 of cheugy, there was a [[debate]] on if the term "cheugy" was misogynistic. This was mainly because of its association with [[mom jeans]], Minion memes, [[live, laugh, love signs|Live, Laugh, Love]], [[girl bosses|girl boss]], and other 'feminine' trends that became outdated.&pWhile it is true that there is an imbalance toward females when the term was used, cheugy can be, and is, used to identify anyone as being untrendy, regardless of [[gender]]. Some 'masculine' cheugy-awarding trends are [[cargo shorts]], [[man buns]], and [[Axe Body Spray]]. It is important to note that using cheugy can still be harmful, and thus should be used with caution.safe>></div>
