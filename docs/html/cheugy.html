      <h1>Cheugy</h1>
      <div>Cheugy is slang for a person who is out-of-date or not trendy, especially when they are trying to and failing. This mainly includes Minion memes and other 2010s humor.<br><br>It is unclear when this term was made, with a variety of sources. Some say it could have been in 2013, while others claim that it was made on the Urban Dictionary in 2018. It was repopularized in 2021 on TikTok.

Around the revitalization in 2021 of cheugy, there was a debate on if the term "cheugy" was misogynistic. This was mainly because of its association with mom jeans, Minion memes, live, laugh, love signs, girl bosses, and other 'feminine' trends that became outdated.<br><br>While it is true that there is an imbalance toward females when the term was used, cheugy can be, and is, used to identify anyone as being untrendy, regardless of gender. Some 'masculine' cheugy-awarding trends are cargo shorts, man buns, and Axe Body Spray. It is important to note that using cheugy can still be harmful, and thus should be used with caution.</div>
