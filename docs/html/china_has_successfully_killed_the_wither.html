      <h1>China has successfully killed the wither</h1>
      <div>China has successfully killed the wither is a internet meme from the YouTube video "China Lights Up the Sky with a Secret Weapon Test" from the channel China Uncensored uploaded on October 22, 2021.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DLAlMp3ZjU(text=refCountref>> At 1:40 into the video, Chris Chappell makes a joke about the China killing the Minecraft Minecraft bosses called "the wither (Minecraft)" to obtain a beacon (Minecraft), which matches a photo of the missile test done by China.
Chris talks about 2021 Chinese orbital-weapon tests being kept secret, before saying "I can tell you what this really means. It means..." while pulling up an image from the Agence France-Presse via Getty Images (likely from the Financial Times article "China tests new space capability with hypersonic missile")<<ref(content=link|https://www.ft.com/content/ba0a3cde-719b-4040-93cb-a486e1f843fb(text=refCountref>> of the missile tests. Chris then looks side-to-side, before continuing, "China has successfully killed the wither," with an image of the wither appearing alongside the image. It cuts to a side-by-side of the missile test image and a powered beacon atop diamond block (Minecraft) from Minecraft, as Chris says, "and now has the resources necessary to activate a beacon. This story broke in the Financial Times. The hypersonic missile thing, not the Minecraft analysis."</div>
