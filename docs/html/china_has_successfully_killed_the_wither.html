      <h1>China has successfully killed the wither</h1>
      <div>China has successfully killed the wither is a meme from the YouTube video "China Lights Up the Sky with a Secret Weapon Test" from the channel China Uncensored uploaded on October 22, 2021. At 1:40 into the video, Chris Chappell makes a joke about the China killing the Minecraft boss called "the wither" to obtain a beacon, which matches a photo of the weapons test done by China.

Chris talks about China's 2021 orbital-weapon tests being kept secret, before saying "I can tell you what this really means. It means..." while pulling up an image from the AFP via Getty Images (likely from the Financial Times article "China tests new space capability with hypersonic missile") of the missile tests. Chris then looks side-to-side, before continuing, "China has successfully killed the wither," with an image of the wither appearing alongside the image. It cuts to a side-by-side of the missile test image and a powered beacon atop diamond blocks from Minecraft, as Chris says, "and now has the resources necessary to activate a beacon. This story broke in the Financial Times. The hypersonic missile thing, not the Minecraft analysis."</div>
