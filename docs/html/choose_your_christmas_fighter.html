      <h1>Choose your Christmas fighter</h1>
      <div>"Choose your Christmas figher" is an advertisement by Voidpet for the mobile game Voidpet Dungeon set during Christmas. The advertisement was released as a YouTube Shorts on December 23, 2025, featuring several Voidpet (fictional species) taking part in festivities. The song "Happy Santa" by Roman Dudchyk plays in the background.

The ad starts with a stage five Kind (Voidpet) standing by a fireplace with two scarf stage one Voidpets as a third (likely Scorn (Voidpet)) snakes by in a Santa hat. A stage five Joy (Voidpet) creates small magical orbs of fire by the Christmas tree before a Santa-hatted stage three Glee (Voidpet) empties a mortar and pestle over a pig roast. Kind returns to the enjoyment of two Voidpets with a bag full of stick. A stage five Vivid (Voidpet) Merry (Voidpet) shakes handbell, boosting Kind and Joy as they stock the fire and illuminate. A stage five Greed (Voidpet) places a sign on a display window, reading "HOLIDAY SALE 50% off" as a stage five Charity (Voidpet) runs by carrying many gift. A stage five Halcyon Estrangement (Voidpet) flies overhead, dropping flyer (pamphlet) to stage one Voidpets, reading "merry Christmas".</div>
