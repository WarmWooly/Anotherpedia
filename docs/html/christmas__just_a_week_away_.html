      <h1>Christmas, just a week away!</h1>
      <div>Christmas, just a week away! refers to a TikTok Duet posted by Keara (@kearamr) on September 5th, 2020. The video features Keara to the left, a timelapse of Christmas cookies being made on the right, and a caption on the top reading "Christmas is next Friday!" Christmas was not next Friday. The absurdity of the video caused it to be spread as a meme across YouTube and iFunny, with a popular format being to replace what was next week with something absurd.
