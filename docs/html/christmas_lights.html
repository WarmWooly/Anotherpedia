      <h1>Christmas lights</h1>
      <div>Christmas lights are decorative electric lights with even spacing between bulbs, including string lights and fairy lights, used during the Christmas season. Christmas lights are often placed around trees, on or around houses, and around other fixtures as festive illumination. The term "Christmas lights" may also be used to describe any decorative lighting related to Christmas. Candles, the original form of Christmas lights, can also fall under this term.</div>
