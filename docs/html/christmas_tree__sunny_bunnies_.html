      <h1>Christmas tree (Sunny Bunnies)</h1>
      <div>"Christmas tree" is the 14th episode of the 1st season of Sunny Bunnies, which was released on December 6, 2016. It was written by Andrew Ledenev, Alexander Lenkin, and Andrew Tolkachev.

After the intro, the camera shows a wide shot of a pine tree in the middle of the park at night. A nearby lamp post with five lamps changes the colors of the bunnies before the bunnies are plopped into the snow. They all run toward the tree adorned with presents, where Hopper opens one. A photo of a decorated Christmas tree flies out, to be caught by Turbo. Turbo then compares the photo to the bare tree, showing the bunnies.<br><br>Hopper hops into the present he opened, causing ornaments to fly out. Boo and Iris both catch an ornament, while Shiny gets a tiara and places it on her head. Boo runs into a small present, knocking a candy cane the size of him, which breaks when Boo grabs it. Hopper and Boo are then seen placing ornaments on the tree, with Boo accidentally wrapping Hopper's ears around a branch of the tree. Iris and Shiny (now without the tiara) are placing ornaments on the tree, before being chased away by Hopper on top of Boo. Iris and Shiny then join the stack to reach higher parts of the tree.<br><br>Turbo, comparing the half-decorated tree and the photo, tells the other bunnies to continue. Boo grabs a tall step ladder as Hopper walks in on stilts. Meanwhile, Iris and Shiny stack presents on top of each other to reach higher. After Turbo views the photo again, he is shocked to see that the top half of the tree is decorated, but not the bottom. When the bunnies view the photo in Turbo's hands, they attempt to correct their mistake but only cover one side of the tree with ornaments. Turbo, enraged, has Iris and Shiny bring over two presents full of ornaments while grabbing a see saw as Boo brings the step ladder. The presents are placed onto one side of the see-saw, using Boo to launch them over the tree, covering the undecorated side. Hopper runs over with a star, while Turbo lassos the tree (with Boo's help) lowers the top to the ground.<br><br>On placement of the star, Boo releases the lasso, flinging the tree backwards, and launching the star. Fireworks then appear, causing the bunnies to admire them. After a transition, the park is shown to be littered with decorations as the group stands next to the tree, now barren of leaves. A single ornament left of the tree falls to the ground, as Shiny grabs a branch near where the ornament fell. Boo then follows suit, causing the tree to be covered in a thick layer of fur of the five colors of the bunnies.<br><br>The blooper reel first shows the bunnies running around the tree, touching it to change the color of the fur. After, it shows a clip of the bunnies stacked on top of each other and the moment the lasso was released, ending the episode.</div>
