      <h1>Chubik (texture pack)</h1>
      <div>Chubik, also known as Chubikcraft, The Chubik Challenge, or Chubik: A Survival Challenge, is a Minecraft Minecraft texture pack created by JustusFT posted onto Minecraft Forum and Planet Minecraft on September 27, 2015, based on the 2009 artwork chubik.<<ref(content=link|https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/2531786-chubik-a-minimalistic-survival-challenge-updated(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/18-512x-chubik/(text=refCountref>> Chubik would later be uploaded to CurseForge the following year.<<ref(content=link|https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/chubik(text=refCountref>> The texture pack features block (Minecraft), item (Minecraft), and mob (Minecraft) being retextured to a plain white with the name of the block/item/mob written in black text. Each texture is 512x512 in size. The texture pack is advertised as a challenge for experienced players, with goals such as Beating Minecraft and Minecraft build-off with the pack enabled. The novelty of the pack made it widely popular amongst the Minecraft playerbase, especially between 2015 and 2016. Various Minecraft YouTuber, including Logdotzip, ibxtoycat, and a6d, made videos on the Chubik texture pack.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ZSEEMuQcI(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OXSI3Ieoy4(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4NeikjwE8Y(text=refCountref>> The latest version of Chubik is for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.9, however, a successor made by iplaygamesbad_, Chubik Remade, updates the texture pack to modern versions.</div>
