      <h1>Chubik (texture pack)</h1>
      <div>Chubik, also known as Chubikcraft, The Chubik Challenge, or Chubik: A Survival Challenge, is a Minecraft texture pack created by JustusFT posted onto Minecraft Forum and Planet Minecraft on September 27, 2015, based on the 2009 artwork chubik. Chubik would later be uploaded to CurseForge the following year. The texture pack features blocks, items, and mobs being retextured to a plain white with the name of the block/item/mob written in black text. Each texture is 512x512 in size. The texture pack is advertised as a challenge for experienced players, with goals such as beating the game and competing in a build-off with the pack enabled. The novelty of the pack made it widely popular amongst the playerbase, especially between 2015 and 2016. Various Minecraft YouTubers, including Logdotzip, ibxtoycat, and a6d, made videos on the Chubik texture pack. The latest version of Chubik is for 1.9, however, a successor made by iplaygamesbad_, Chubik Remade, updates the texture pack to modern versions.</div>
