      <h1>Chubik Remade</h1>
      <div>Chubik Remade is a Minecraft texture pack created by iplaygamesbad_ posted onto CurseForge on July 24, 2022, to update the Chubik texture pack to modern versions.<<ref(content=link|https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/chubik-remade(text=refCountref>> Unlike the original pack, only blocks are updated, with mobs and items left untouched. Additionally, water is opaque instead of transparent, textures prefer the file name over the block's name (such as Grass Block Overlay instead of Grass Block), and each texture is 256x256 in size. While it was originally made for 1.19, <<asofJuly 2025>>, it's available for versions up to 1.21.3.</div>
