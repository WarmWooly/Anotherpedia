      <h1>Cinnamon Challenge</h1>
      <div>The Cinnamon Challenge was a food challenge that spread across the internet due to the limited supplies needed to participate, including a spoon, cinnamon, and a phone. The goal of the challenge was to eat a spoonful of cinnamon in under a minute without drinking anything.

The idea of the Cinnamon Challenge had been around since 2001, steadily increasing until a sharp spike in 2012, where it then concluded by 2014. The social media platforms used were primarily YouTube and Twitter.<br><br>The challenge was simple to put together, requiring a spoon, cinnamon, and a phone to record the challenge as proof of completion.

It has been known to cause gagging or choking, and occasionally vomiting.<br><br>It has been known to irritate the throat and can cause serious health risks. This can be seen by the fact that over 100 calls were made to Poison Control Centers in America. It has even been known to cause pneumonia and even collapsed lungs.</div>
