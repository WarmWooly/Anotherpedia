      <h1>Circle</h1>
      <div>A circle is a second dimension shape where all point (geometry) on the circle is an equal distance from the center. This distance is known as the radius. The distance going from one point to another through the center is known as the diameter. The perimeter of a circle is called a circumference and can be calculated by multiplying the diameter with pi (C = &mpid, or C = 2&mpir). The area of a circle can be calculated by multiplying the radius exponent with pi (A = &mpirs-p2).&pIn trigonometry, a unit circle is used to measurement angle for triangle.</div>
