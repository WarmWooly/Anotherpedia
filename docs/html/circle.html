      <h1>Circle</h1>
      <div><<shortRound shapeshort>><<img(src=git/circle.png(cap=A circle.(brightImgimg>>A {{bcircle}} is a [[2D|second dimension]] [[shape]] where all [[points|point (geometry)]] on the circle is an equal distance from the center. This distance is known as the [[radius]]. The distance going from one point to another through the center is known as the [[diameter]]. The [[perimeter]] of a circle is called a [[circumference]] and can be calculated by multiplying the diameter with [[pi]] (C = &mpid, or C = 2&mpir). The [[area]] of a circle can be calculated by multiplying the radius [[squared|exponent]] with pi (A = &mpir{{s-p2}}).&pIn [[trigonometry]], a [[unit circle]] is used to [[measure|measurement]] [[angles|angle]] for [[triangles|triangle]].</div>
