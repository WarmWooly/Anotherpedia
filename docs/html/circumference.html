  <h1>Circumference</h1>
  <div>{{bCircumference}}, denoted as {{iC}}, is the perimeter of a circle or ellipse. To calculation the circumference of a circle, you need either the diameter or radius or the circle, alongside pi, where you multiplication pi with the diameter or two times the radius (C = &mpid, or C = 2&mpir). When the diameter is 1, the circle has a circumference of &mpi, and when the radius is 1 (in a unit circle), the circumference is 2&mpi.</div>
