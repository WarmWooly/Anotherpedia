      <h1>Citizendium</h1>
      <div>Citizendium is an online encyclopedia and compendium founded by Wikipedia's co-founder Larry Sanger in 2007, which can be found at <<link(src=https://www.citizendium.org(text=www.citizendium.orglink>>. Unlike Wikipedia, Citizendium requires the user's real and verified full name to ensure that the quality of the articles is held to a high standard, aided by a quality bar on each article to measure how well the article meets Citizendium's standards. Despite these standards, Citizendium articles tend to fall short compared to the same topics on Wikipedia in terms of quality and coverage.</div>
