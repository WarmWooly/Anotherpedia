      <h1>Claim</h1>
      <div>For other uses of the term claim, see claim (disambiguation).<br>A claim is a statement where the person is saying that some fact or knowledge is true, especially with little to no evidence. These claims then can be proven or disproven by using evidence and logic to reach a conclusion, either proving it to be true or false. Claims are often treated with skepticism because of the failure to overcome the burden of proof to make the claim legitimate.</div>
