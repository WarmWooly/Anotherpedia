      <h1>Claim</h1>
      <div>For other uses of the term claim, see claim (disambiguation).&spA claim is a statement where the person is saying that some fact or knowledge is true, especially with little to no evidence. These claims then can be prove or disprove by using evidence and logic to reach a logical conclusion, either proving it to be true or false. Claims are often treated with skepticism because of the failure to overcome the burden of proof to make the claim legitimate.</div>
