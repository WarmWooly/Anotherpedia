  <h1>Classic (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div><<shortFirst map in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/classic laser fight.png(cap=The map Classic.img>>{{bClassic}} is a large outdoor [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox Game)]]}}, being the first map made for the game. Players spawn in one of the four colored bases on the sides of the map. Along the corners are tunnels and small lookout nests. Closer to the center, multiple barriers, vantage points, and tunnel entrances surround the area. Several ramps are placed to [[slide|slide (Laser Fight)]] off of to gain height. Eight tall, dinky platforms surround the center, completely exposed while giving the best view over the map. The center has a tower with a ladder to the underground tunnels, surrounded by large ramps that can be used to quickly get to the top of the tower. The tunnels are a simple cross that connect the four edges of the map with the center tower.</div>
