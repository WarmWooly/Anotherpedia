      <h1>Classic (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Classic is a large outdoor map in Laser Fight, being the first map made for the game. Players spawn in one of the four colored bases on the sides of the map. Along the corners are tunnels and small lookout nests. Closer to the center, multiple barriers, vantage points, and tunnel entrances surround the area. Several ramps are placed to slide off of to gain height. Eight tall, dinky platforms surround the center, completely exposed while giving the best view over the map. The center has a tower with a ladder to the underground tunnels, surrounded by large ramps that can be used to quickly get to the top of the tower. The tunnels are a simple cross that connect the four edges of the map with the center tower.</div>
