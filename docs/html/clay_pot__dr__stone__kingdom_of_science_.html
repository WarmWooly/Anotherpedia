A clay pot can be crafting (Minecraft) with 4 clay brick (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science) (place in a ring).
Clay pots are used in the following crafting recipes:&spDistilling Pot (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science) - 1 clay pot, 3 clay bricks, 1 bamboo (Minecraft)/sugar cane (Minecraft), 1 campfire (Minecraft), and 1 cobblestone (Minecraft) (place a brick in the center, a brick above, the cobblestone to the left, the plant to the right, the pot below, the campfire in the bottom-left corner, and the last brick in the top-right corner).
The clay pot can be used to ferment fruit juices into wine. Three cups of cup of grape juice (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science), cup of sweetberry juice (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science), or cup of glowberry juice (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science) can be placed into a clay pot, where it will then start fermenting. Every 3--5 minutes, the player (Minecraft) must interact with the pot using a stick (Minecraft) to stir the mixture. When trying to stir too early, the message "Not ready to be stirred!" will appear. The mixture will bubble when it's ready to be stirred. After being stirred three times, it will start turning into wine. When trying to collect it too early, the message "Not ready to be collected!" will appear. After 3--5 more minutes, the juice will fully ferment, which can be removed using a clay cup (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science). Three wines are made per batch.
When placed under a miracle dripstone (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science), the clay pot will slowly collect miracle fluid (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science), which can be removed using a clay cup (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science).</div>
