      <h1>Clay Pot (Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|N/A||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The clay pot is a block in the Minecraft mod Dr. Stone: Kingdom of Science used for the Distilling Pot and making wines.



A clay pot can be crafted with 4 clay bricks (place in a ring).



Clay pots are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Distilling Pot - 1 clay pot, 3 clay bricks, 1 bamboo/sugar cane, 1 campfire, and 1 cobblestone (place a brick in the center, a brick above, the cobblestone to the left, the plant to the right, the pot below, the campfire in the bottom-left corner, and the last brick in the top-right corner).

The clay pot can be used to ferment fruit juices into wine. Three cups of grape, sweetberry, or glowberry juice can be placed into a clay pot, where it will then start fermenting. Every 3--5 minutes, the player must interact with the pot using a stick to stir the mixture. When trying to stir too early, the message "Not ready to be stirred!" will appear. The mixture will bubble when it's ready to be stirred. After being stirred three times, it will start turning into wine. When trying to collect it too early, the message "Not ready to be collected!" will appear. After 3--5 more minutes, the juice will fully ferment, which can be removed using a clay cup. Three wines are made per batch.

When placed under a miracle dripstone, the clay pot will slowly collect miracle fluid, which can be removed using a clay cup.</div>
