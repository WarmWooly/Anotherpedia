      <h1>Clock</h1>
      <div>A clock is a device used to measure and display the passing of time. Clocks are used by people to schedule and manage time, to perform tasks at specific times of the day (such as eating or sleeping), and to determine when a task or process will be completed. While the first clocks were sundials and water clocks, modern clocks used are analog or digital.</div>
