      <h1>Clothing in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</h1>
      <div>The Pokémon spin-off games Pokémon Mystery Dungeon have a large majority of Pokémon wearing neckwear of some sort, including scarfs, bowties, neckerchiefs, and most common of all, bandanas. It is seen in a variety of locations, such as on cover art, promotional images, and in-game characters. There is no given reason for the Pokémon to be wearing cosmetic gear such as bandanas, most likely to breathe more life into the characters due to the nature of the game. Pokémon in these games do not wear other non-neck clothing items.</div>
