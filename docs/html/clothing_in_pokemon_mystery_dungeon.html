It is seen in a variety of locations, such as on [[cover art]], [[promotional images|promotional image]], and in-game [[characters|character]]. There is no given reason for the Pokémon to be wearing cosmetic gear such as bandanas, most likely to breathe more life into the characters due to the nature of the game. Pokémon in these games do not wear other non-neck clothing items.<<img(src=git/red rescue team.jpg(cap=The cover of {{i[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red/Blue Rescue Team]]}}, where all members of the red team wear a red bandana.(leftImgimg>></div>
