Coal can be mined from patches of coal from the surface or from rocks. Coal can be collected through manual harvesting or through burner/electric mining drills.
In an assembling machine or through manual crafting, coal can be used to create:&spGrenade - 10 coal and 5 iron plates (8 time)&spPoison capsule - 10 coal, 3 electronic circuits, and 3 steel plates (8 time)&spSlowdown capsule - 5 coal, 2 electronic circuits, and 2 steel plates (8 time)
Coal can be processed within a chemical plant to produce:&spExplosives x2 - 1 coal, 1 sulfer, and 10 water (8 time)&spPlastic bar x2 - 1 coal and 20 petroleum gas (1 time)
In an oil refinery, coal can be processed into oil through coal liquefaction.&sp10 coal, 25 heavy oil, and 50 steam --> 90 heavy oil, 20 light oil, and 10 petroleum gas.
