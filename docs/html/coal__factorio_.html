      <div><<info||Stats||Stack size|50||Mining time|1||Fuel value|4 MJ||Vehicle acceleration|100%info>>Coal is a resource in Factorio that can generate on the surface or be found within rocks. Coal is used as fuel for multiple machines and vehicles and for processing weapons and plastic.



Coal can be mined from patches of coal from the surface or from rocks. Coal can be collected through manual harvesting or through burner/electric mining drills.



In an assembling machine or through manual crafting, coal can be used to create:<br>Grenade - 10 coal and 5 iron plates (8 time)<br>Poison capsule - 10 coal, 3 electronic circuits, and 3 steel plates (8 time)<br>Slowdown capsule - 5 coal, 2 electronic circuits, and 2 steel plates (8 time)

Coal can be processed within a chemical plant to produce:<br>Explosives x2 - 1 coal, 1 sulfer, and 10 water (8 time)<br>Plastic bar x2 - 1 coal and 20 petroleum gas (1 time)

In an oil refinery, coal can be processed into oil through coal liquefaction.<br>10 coal, 25 heavy oil, and 50 steam --> 90 heavy oil, 20 light oil, and 10 petroleum gas.

Coal can be used as a fuel for machines and vehicles, including:<br>Boiler<br>Burner inserter<br>Burner mining drill<br>Car<br>Locomotive<br>Steel furnace<br>Stone furnace<br>Tank</div>
