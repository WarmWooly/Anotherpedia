  <h1>Coal (Factorio)</h1>
  <div><<info||Stats||Stack size (Factorio)|50||Mining time|1||Fuel value|4 MJ||Vehicle acceleration|100%info>>Coal is a resource (Factorio) in Factorio that can generate on the surface or be found within rock (Factorio). Coal is used as fuel (Factorio) for multiple machines and vehicle (Factorio) and for processing weapons and plastic bar (Factorio).
Coal can be mined from patches of coal from the surface or from rocks. Coal can be collected through Manual harvesting (Factorio) or through Burner mining drill (Factorio)/Electric mining drill (Factorio).
In an assembling machine (Factorio) or through manual crafting (Factorio), coal can be used to create:&spGrenade (Factorio) - 10 coal and 5 iron plate (Factorio) (8 time (Factorio))&spPoison capsule (Factorio) - 10 coal, 3 electronic circuit (Factorio), and 3 steel plate (Factorio) (8 time)&spSlowdown capsule (Factorio) - 5 coal, 2 electronic circuit (Factorio), and 2 steel plate (Factorio) (8 time)
Coal can be processed within a chemical plant (Factorio) to produce:&spExplosives (Factorio) x2 - 1 coal, 1 sulfer (Factorio), and 10 water (Factorio) (8 time)&spPlastic bar (Factorio) x2 - 1 coal and 20 petroleum gas (Factorio) (1 time)
In an oil refinery (Factorio), coal can be processed into oil through coal liquefaction (Factorio).&sp10 coal, 25 heavy oil (Factorio), and 50 steam (Factorio) --> 90 heavy oil, 20 light oil (Factorio), and 10 petroleum gas (Factorio).
Coal can be used as a fuel for machines and vehicles, including:&spBoiler (Factorio)&spBurner inserter (Factorio)&spBurner mining drill (Factorio)&spCar (Factorio)&spLocomotive (Factorio)&spSteel furnace (Factorio)&spStone furnace (Factorio)&spTank (Factorio)</div>
