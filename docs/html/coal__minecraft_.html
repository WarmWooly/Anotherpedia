      <h1>Coal (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Coal is an item in Minecraft that is often used in smelting.



When coal ore is mined with a pickaxe, it will drop 1 coal. When mined with Fortune, it has a chance to drop an extra piece of coal with each level, with a maximum of 4 coal using Fortune III. Silk Touch will prevent the ore from dropping coal.

Coal can be crafted with 1 block of coal, which will produce 9 coal.

Coal ore can be smelted in a furnace or blast furnace to produce 1 coal, alongside  experience.

Wither skeletons have a 33.3% chance of dropping 1 coal on death. When slain with Looting, it has a chance to drop 1 more coal per level. The chance for it to drop coal is 1 - 2 / (Looting + 3), which equals out to 1/3, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3 for no Looting, I, II, and III respectively. The chance to get more coal with Looting is equally spread (ex. Looting II --> 40% 0 coal, 20% 1 coal, 20% 2 coal, 20% 3 coal).



Coal is used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Block of Coal - 9 coal (filling all available slots)<br>Campfire - 1 coal, 3 sticks, and 3 logs, stripped logs, wood, or stripped wood (the coal goes in the center, with the wood filling the bottom row, and the sticks surrounding the other three sides of the coal)<br>Fire Charge x3 - 1 coal, 1 blaze powder, and  1 gunpowder (shapeless)<br>Soul Torch x4 - 1 coal, 1 stick, and 1 soul sand or soul soil (the soul sand/soil  goes on the bottom, with a stick above it, then the coal)<br>Torch x4 - 1 coal and 1 stick (the stick goes on the bottom, with a coal above it)

In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 coal can fuel for 80 seconds (8 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (64 coal, 5120 seconds, 512 items).<br>In a minecart with furnace, 1 coal can fuel for 3 minutes (720 meters, 3600 ticks), with a maximum of just over 9 coal (~27.3 minutes, ~6553.4 meters, 32767 ticks).
