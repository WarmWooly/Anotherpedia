Coal can be crafted with 1 block of coal, which will produce 9 coal.
Coal ore can be smelted in a furnace or blast furnace to produce 1 coal, alongside <<note(content=For any remaining fractional experience, there will be a chance to gain an extra experience point based on the remaining experience (ex. 0.3 --> 30% chance).(text=u-d0.1note>> experience.
