      <h1>Cobblefiers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div>For the specific item, see Cobblefier ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}&sp<<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Cobblefiers are a type of item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail. Cobblefiers are used in the Cobblestone Generator (Not Lazy Chainmail) to modify its output.
All cobblefiers are crafting (Minecraft), all requiring the cobblefier (Not Lazy Chainmail) as a base. Some cobblefiers require items, while others are a mix between two or more cobblefiers.
Cobblefiers can be placed into a Cobblestone Generator (Not Lazy Chainmail) to create various materials, with different cobblefiers running faster/slower depending on the value of the item. Some items (such as soul sand (Minecraft)) that can be generated are much slower to compensate for their use in other processes (i.e. sieving (Not Lazy Chainmail)).
When all the 52 cobblefiers are placed in an Expanded Barrel Collector (Not Lazy Chainmail), the player will be awarded the advancement (Minecraft) Cobblestone is Everything (Not Lazy Chainmail).
