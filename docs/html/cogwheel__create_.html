      <h1>Cogwheel (Create)</h1>
      <div>For the larger cog, see large cogwheel ({{aiCreate).}}&sp<<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden axe&sp/pickaxe||Blast resistance|6||Hardness|1.5||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Waterloggable|Yes||{{bFlammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The cogwheel is a block in the Minecraft mod Create used in carrying rotational power. It can both carry rotation along its shaft to the front and back of it and to its sides to any connected cogwheels, large cogwheels, and other blocks requiring rotational power.
A cogwheel can be crafted with 1 shaft and 1 plank (shapeless).
A cogwheel can be crafted with a mechanical mixer mixing 1 shaft and 1 plank in a basin.
A cogwheel can be created when a deployer places a plank onto a shaft on a depot or mechanical belt.
When making a precision mechanism, there is a 3.4% chance of a cogwheel being produced instead.
A cogwheel can transfer rotational power to adjacent interlocking cogwheels. Cogwheels can also connect to shafts, blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. water wheels), and blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. millstones). When a cogwheel transfers rotational power to another cogwheel, the direction of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an encased fan suck instead of blow) or change the direction of mechanical belts.&pWhen placing cogwheels, they can be quickly placed adjacent to each other, with a ghost image showing where the cogwheel will be placed. If the player is wearing engineer's goggles, a particle effect will show the direction of the placed cogwheel. If a cogwheel goes above 256 RPM, is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel, or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.
When a cogwheel is diagonal to a large cogwheel, the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a cogwheel, the RPM will double, and if the cogwheel is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the stress used. When a cogwheel and a large cogwheel are connected, the advancement Shifting Gears will be awarded.
Cogwheels can be encased using andesite and brass casing. This serves both as a decorative covering to hide or integrate cogwheels into builds, and to prevent shafts/cogwheels from connecting to the cogwheel. A wrench can be used to create openings for shafts to connect to the encased cogwheel.
Cogwheels are used in the following crafting recipes:&spBrown Toolbox - 1 cogwheel, 2 golden sheets, 1 chest, and 1 leather (place the chest in the center, the sheets to the left and right, the cogwheel above, and the leather below).&spGantry Carriage - 1 cogwheel, 1 andesite casing, and 1 wooden slab (place the casing in the center, the slab above, and the cogwheel below).&spGearbox - 4 cogwheels and 1 andesite casing (place the casing in the center and surround with cogwheels).&spGearshift - 1 cogwheel, 1 andesite casing, and 1 redstone dust (shapeless).&spLarge Cogwheel - 1 cogwheel and 1 plank (shapeless).&spMechanical Mixer - 1 cogwheel, 1 andesite casing, and 1 whisk (place the casing in the center, the cogwheel above, and the whisk below).&spMechanical Pump - 1 cogwheel and 1 fluid pipe (shapeless).&spMillstone - 1 cogwheel, 1 andesite casing, and 1 stone<<note(content="Stone" includes various stone-like blocks, including deepslate, tuff, and granite.(text=noteCountnote>> (place the casing in the center, the cogwheel above, and the stone below).&spSequenced Gearshift - 1 cogwheel, 1 brass casing, and 1 electron tube (shapeless).&spVertical Gearbox - 4 cogwheels and 1 andesite casing (place the casing in the center and the cogwheels in the corners).&spWeighted Ejector - 1 cogwheel, 1 depot, and 1 golden sheet (place the depot in the center, the sheet above, and the cogwheel below).&spWrench - 1 cogwheel, 3 golden sheets, and 1 stick (place the cogwheel in the center, the sheets above, to the left, and in the top-left corner, and the stick below).
The following items can be made with mechanical crafters with cogwheels: Brown Toolbox (5 crafters), Gantry Carriage (3 crafters), Gearbox (5 crafters), Mechanical Mixer (3 crafters), Millstone (3 crafters), Vertical Gearbox (7 crafters; 2 covers), Weighted Ejector (3 crafters), and Wrench (5 crafters).
The following items can be made with a mechanical mixer and a basin with cogwheels: Gearshift, Large Cogwheel, Mechanical Pump, and Sequenced Gearshift.
Cogwheels are used in the following deploying recipes:&spLarge Cogwheel - Deploy a plank on a cogwheel.
Cogwheels are used in the following sequenced assemblies:&spPrecision Mechanism<<note(content=There is only an 80% chance of getting a precision mechanism, with a 20% chance to get salvage: 5.4% for andesite alloy, 5.4% for a golden sheet, 3.4% for a cogwheel, 1.4% for crushed gold ore, 1.4% for a gold nugget, 1.4% for a shaft, 0.7% for a clock.(text=noteCountnote>> - On a golden sheet, deploy a cogwheel, then a large cogwheel, and lastly an iron nugget, repeating the sequence 5 times (costs 5 cogwheels, 5 large cogwheels, 5 iron nuggets, and 1 golden sheet).</div>
