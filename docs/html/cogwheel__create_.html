It can both carry rotation along its shaft to the front and back of it and to its sides to any connected cogwheels, [[large cogwheels|large cogwheel (Create)]], and other blocks requiring rotational power.<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>A cogwheel can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]] with 1 [[shaft|shaft (Create)]] and 1 [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] (shapeless).<<hr3Automated shapeless craftinghr3>>A cogwheel can be crafted with a [[mechanical mixer|mechanical mixer (Create)]] mixing 1 [[shaft|shaft (Create)]] and 1 [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] in a [[basin|basin (Create)]].<<hr2Deployinghr2>>A cogwheel can be created when a [[deployer|deployer (Create)]] places a [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] onto a [[shaft|shaft (Create)]] on a [[depot|depot (Create)]] or [[mechanical belt|mechanical belt (Create)]].<<hr2Precision mechanism salvagehr2>>When making a [[precision mechanism|precision mechanism (Create)]], there is a 3.4% chance of a cogwheel being produced instead.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Transfering rotational powerhr2>><<img(src=git/cogwheel transfer create.gif(cap=Cogwheels transferring rotational power.(leftImgimg>>A cogwheel can transfer [[rotational power|rotational power (Create)]] to adjacent interlocking cogwheels. Cogwheels can also connect to [[shafts|shaft (Create)]], blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. [[water wheels|water wheel (Create)]]), and blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. [[millstones|millstone (Create)]]). When a cogwheel transfers rotational power to another cogwheel, the [[direction|rotation direction (Create)]] of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an [[encased fan|encased fan (Create)]] suck instead of blow) or change the direction of [[mechanical belts|mechanical belt (Create)]].&pWhen placing cogwheels, they can be quickly placed adjacent to each other, with a ghost image showing where the cogwheel will be placed. If the player is wearing [[engineer's goggles|engineer's goggles (Create)]], a particle effect will show the direction of the placed cogwheel. If a cogwheel goes above 256 RPM, is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel, or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.<<hr3Gearshiftinghr3>><<img(src=git/cogwheel gearshift create.gif(cap=A large cogwheel gearshifting into cogwheels.img>>When a cogwheel is diagonal to a [[large cogwheel|large cogwheel (Create)]], the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a cogwheel, the RPM will double, and if the cogwheel is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the [[stress|stress (Create)]] used. When a cogwheel and a large cogwheel are connected, the [[advancement|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Shifting Gears|Shifting Gears (Create)]] will be awarded.<<hr3Casinghr3>><<img(src=git/encased cogwheel create.png(cap=Encased cogwheels.img>>Cogwheels can be encased using [[andesite|andesite casing (Create)]] and [[brass casing|brass casing (Create)]]. This serves both as a decorative covering to hide or integrate cogwheels into builds, and to prevent shafts/cogwheels from connecting to the cogwheel. A [[wrench|wrench (Create)]] can be used to create openings for shafts to connect to the encased cogwheel.<<hr2Craftinghr2>>Cogwheels are used in the following [[crafting|crafting (Minecraft)]] recipes:&sp[[Brown Toolbox|Brown Toolbox (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 2 [[golden sheets|golden sheet (Create)]], 1 [[chest|chest (Minecraft)]], and 1 [[leather|leather (Minecraft)]] (place the chest in the center, the sheets to the left and right, the cogwheel above, and the leather below).&sp[[Gantry Carriage|Gantry Carriage (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]], and 1 [[wooden slab|wooden slabs (Minecraft)]] (place the casing in the center, the slab above, and the cogwheel below).&sp[[Gearbox|Gearbox (Create)]] - 4 cogwheels and 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]] (place the casing in the center and surround with cogwheels).&sp[[Gearshift|Gearshift (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]], and 1 [[redstone dust|redstone dust (Minecraft)]] (shapeless).&sp[[Large Cogwheel|Large Cogwheel (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel and 1 [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] (shapeless).&sp[[Mechanical Mixer|Mechanical Mixer (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]], and 1 [[whisk|whisk (Create)]] (place the casing in the center, the cogwheel above, and the whisk below).&sp[[Mechanical Pump|Mechanical Pump (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel and 1 [[fluid pipe|fluid pipe (Create)]] (shapeless).&sp[[Millstone|Millstone (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]], and 1 [[stone|stone (Minecraft)]]<<note(content="Stone" includes various stone-like blocks, including [[deepslate|deepslate (Minecraft)]], [[tuff|tuff (Minecraft)]], and [[granite|granite (Minecraft)]].(text=noteCountnote>> (place the casing in the center, the cogwheel above, and the stone below).&sp[[Sequenced Gearshift|Sequenced Gearshift (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 1 [[brass casing|brass casing (Create)]], and 1 [[electron tube|electron tube (Create)]] (shapeless).&sp[[Vertical Gearbox|Vertical Gearbox (Create)]] - 4 cogwheels and 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]] (place the casing in the center and the cogwheels in the corners).&sp[[Weighted Ejector|Weighted Ejector (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 1 [[depot|depot (Create)]], and 1 [[golden sheet|golden sheet (Create)]] (place the depot in the center, the sheet above, and the cogwheel below).&sp[[Wrench|Wrench (Create)]] - 1 cogwheel, 3 [[golden sheets|golden sheet (Create)]], and 1 [[stick|stick (Minecraft)]] (place the cogwheel in the center, the sheets above, to the left, and in the top-left corner, and the stick below).<<hr3Automated shaped craftinghr3>>The following items can be made with [[mechanical crafters|mechanical crafter (Create)]] with cogwheels: [[Brown Toolbox|Brown Toolbox (Create)]] (5 crafters), [[Gantry Carriage|Gantry Carriage (Create)]] (3 crafters), [[Gearbox|Gearbox (Create)]] (5 crafters), [[Mechanical Mixer|Mechanical Mixer (Create)]] (3 crafters), [[Millstone|Millstone (Create)]] (3 crafters), [[Vertical Gearbox|Vertical Gearbox (Create)]] (7 crafters; 2 [[covers|crafter slot cover (Create)]]), [[Weighted Ejector|Weighted Ejector (Create)]] (3 crafters), and [[Wrench|Wrench (Create)]] (5 crafters).<<hr3Automated shapeless craftinghr3>>The following items can be made with a [[mechanical mixer|mechanical mixer (Create)]] and a [[basin|basin (Create)]] with cogwheels: [[Gearshift|Gearshift (Create)]], [[Large Cogwheel|Large Cogwheel (Create)]], [[Mechanical Pump|Mechanical Pump (Create)]], and [[Sequenced Gearshift|Sequenced Gearshift (Create)]].<<hr2Deployinghr2>>Cogwheels are used in the following [[deploying|deployer (Create)]] recipes:&sp[[Large Cogwheel|Large Cogwheel (Create)]] - Deploy a [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] on a cogwheel.<<hr2Sequenced assemblyhr2>>Cogwheels are used in the following [[sequenced assemblies|sequenced assembly (Create)]]:&sp[[Precision Mechanism|Precision Mechanism (Create)]]<<note(content=There is only an 80% chance of getting a precision mechanism, with a 20% chance to get salvage: 5.4% for [[andesite alloy|andesite alloy (Create)]], 5.4% for a [[golden sheet|golden sheet (Create)]], 3.4% for a cogwheel, 1.4% for [[crushed gold ore|crushed gold ore (Create)]], 1.4% for a [[gold nugget|gold nugget (Minecraft)]], 1.4% for a [[shaft|shaft (Create)]], 0.7% for a [[clock|clock (Minecraft), and 0.7% for an [[iron ingot|iron ingot (Minecraft)]].(text=noteCountnote>> - On a [[golden sheet|golden sheet (Create)]], deploy a cogwheel, then a [[large cogwheel|large cogwheel (Create)]], and lastly an [[iron nugget|iron nugget (Minecraft)]], repeating the sequence 5 times (costs 5 cogwheels, 5 large cogwheels, 5 iron nuggets, and 1 golden sheet).</div>
