      <h1>cohost (social media)</h1>
      <div>cohost was a social media platform founded by the anti software software club and publically launched in June 2022 based on anti-capitalism ideals to compete with Twitter and Threads. cohost claimed to have no website tracker, advertisement, or aggressive social media algorithm. The mascot for cohost is the eggbug (cohost). Posts on cohost are called "hosts". The platform is planned to be shut down by the end of 2024 as it did not have enough funds to continue being maintained and run, entering a read-only mode on October 1st.<br></div>
