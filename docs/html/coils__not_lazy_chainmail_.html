      <h1>Coils (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Coils are a type of item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail. Coils are used to be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) into chain links (Not Lazy Chainmail) and come in the materials of iron coil (Not Lazy Chainmail), gold coil (Not Lazy Chainmail), copper coil (Not Lazy Chainmail), netherite coil (Not Lazy Chainmail), rose gold coil (Not Lazy Chainmail), and iron composite coil (Not Lazy Chainmail).



When a wires (Not Lazy Chainmail) or spool (Not Lazy Chainmail) or material is wound in a winding jig (Not Lazy Chainmail) or auto winder (Not Lazy Chainmail), a coil of the same material is created. While wires only give one coil, spools give back 10. Spools are ~11% more efficient than wires when being winded into coils.



Main page: Snipping ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}<br>Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be used to snip a coil into its respective chain links (Not Lazy Chainmail) of the same material. A coil can be snipped 64 times, creating a stack (Minecraft) of chain links. Better pliers decrease the snips required to harvest all the chain links from a coil. The auto snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be used to automate the process of snipping.</div>
