      <h1>Coils (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|No<<note(content=Besides Netherite.(text=noteCountnote>>info>>Coils are a type of item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. Coils are used to be snipped into chain links and come in the materials of iron, gold, copper, netherite, rose gold, and iron composite.
When a wire or spool or material is wound in a winding jig or auto winder, a coil of the same material is created. While wires only give one coil, spools give back 10. Spools are ~11% more efficient than wires when being winded into coils.
Main page: Snipping ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}&spPliers can be used to snip a coil into its respective chain link of the same material. A coil can be snipped 64 times, creating a stack of chain links. Better pliers decrease the snips required to harvest all the chain links from a coil. The auto snipper can be used to automate the process of snipping.</div>
