While wires only give one coil, spools give back 10. Spools are ~11% more efficient than wires when being winded into coils.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Snippinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Snipping ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail}})]]}}&sp[[Pliers|Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be used to snip a coil into its respective [[chain link|chain links (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] of the same material. A coil can be snipped 64 times, creating a [[stack|stack (Minecraft)]] of chain links. Better pliers decrease the snips required to harvest all the chain links from a coil. The [[auto snipper|auto snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be used to automate the process of snipping.</div>
