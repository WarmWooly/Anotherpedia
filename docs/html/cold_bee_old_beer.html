      <h1>Cold Bee Old Beer</h1>
      <div>Cold Bee Old Beer refers to a TikTok video by <<link(src=https://www.tiktok.com/@purplepeopleeatergmc(text=JustLoudNotFast 🍻link>> on April 2, 2024, where two people read a sign at a BP gas station that cuts "COLD BEER" into "COLD BEE" and "OLD BEER" due to the limited size constraints of the sign. The video is shot from the passenger seat of a parked GMC vehicle at the gas station, with the sign in frame throughout the whole duration, with the video running for 9 seconds. The video is the most popular from JustLoudNotFast 🍻, amassing 15.3 million views <<asofFebruary 2025>>.

Person 1: Oh please.<br>Person 2: Cold bee?<br>Person 1: What?<br>Person 2: Warm him up, give him a blanket.<br>[The sign shifts over a letter, turning the message from "COLD BEE" into "OLD BEER"]<br>Person 1 & 2: Old beer!?</div>
