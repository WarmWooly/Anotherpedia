      <h1>College student</h1>
      <div>A college student or university student is a student (generally a young adult) who is enrolled in a college or university. College students tend to gather around dorms, campuses, local businesses, parks, and other places of interest nearby or within a college. They may live on-campus, nearby, or at home. Stereotypes of college students tend to include being stressed, tired, anxious (especially around exams or finals), liberal, and/or activist.</div>
