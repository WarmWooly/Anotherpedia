Because of that, this page is debatable page.&spCome on Snake - Let's Rattle was a concert series from April 4th, 2014, to presumably May 16th, 2014.<<note(content=It is unknown if they performed on May 16th, 2014 or if the series was ended beforehand.(text=noteCountnote>> The series primarily focused on 50s Rock and Roll, alongside other song during the relevant time period. This is thematically coherent, as the name of the series mirrors the 1950s idiom "Come on snake, let's rattle", which can be used to request a dance.
