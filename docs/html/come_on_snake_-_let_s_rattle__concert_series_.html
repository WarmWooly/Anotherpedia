      <h1>Come on Snake - Let's Rattle (concert series)</h1>
      <div>Sorce Issue: It is unclear how many shows in this concert series were performed, alongside other important information. Because of that, this page is debatable.<br>Come on Snake - Let's Rattle was a concert series from April 4th, 2014, to presumably May 16th, 2014. The series primarily focused on 50s Rock and Roll, alongside other songs during the relevant time period. This is thematically coherent, as the name of the series mirrors the 1950s idiom "Come on snake, let's rattle", which can be used to request a dance. The series was held in an Abbey Tavern in Kentish Town, London, United Kingdom.</div>
