  <div>{{tFor the song, see Come on Snake, Let's Rattle (song), and for the 2014 concert series, see Come on Snake - Let's Rattle (concert series).}}&spThe idiom "{{bCome on snake, let's rattle}}" is used to either to request a dance or to provoke a fight. The idiom saw usage primarily in the 1950s. For the first connotation, the idea is that rattle from a rattlesnake is caused by movement, which mirrors the movement of dancing. The other connotation also uses the rattling to represent movement, just in a more confrontational manner. To distinguish, context clues (such as the tone and gesture) are key to use.</div>
