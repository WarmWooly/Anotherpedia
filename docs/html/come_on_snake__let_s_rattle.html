The idiom saw usage primarily in the 1950s. For the first connotation, the idea is that [[rattling|rattle]] from a [[rattlesnake]] is caused by [[movement]], which mirrors the movement of dancing. The other connotation also uses the rattling to represent movement, just in a more confrontational manner. To distinguish, [[context clues]] (such as the [[tone]] and [[gestures|gesture]]) are key to use.</div>
