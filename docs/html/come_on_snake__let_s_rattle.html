      <h1>Come on snake, let's rattle</h1>
      <div>For the song, see Come on Snake, Let's Rattle (song), and for the 2014 concert series, see Come on Snake - Let's Rattle (concert series).<br>The idiom "Come on snake, let's rattle" is used to either to request a dance or to provoke a fight. The idiom saw usage primarily in the 1950s. For the first connotation, the idea is that rattling from a rattlesnake is caused by movement, which mirrors the movement of dancing. The other connotation also uses the rattling to represent movement, just in a more confrontational manner. To distinguish, context clues (such as the tone and gestures) are key to use.</div>
