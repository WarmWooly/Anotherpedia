      <h1>Complication (horology)</h1>
      <div>In horology, a complication is any part or feature in a timepiece that is not for the purpose of displaying hours, minutes, or seconds. One of the most notable timepieces with a complication is a chronograph, containing both a display watch and a stopwatch. Others may include 24-hour analog dials, calendar dates, and days of the week. A wandering hour is more for design rather than an additional purpose. Watches that self-wind are also considered to have an added complication. Alarms are also present in many watches and clocks. Other measuring devices not related to time may also be present, such as a thermometer or compass, but it is debated if they should be considered a complication because of their separate nature from the timepiece.</div>
