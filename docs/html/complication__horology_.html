One of the most notable timepieces with a complication is a [[chronograph]], containing both a display watch and a [[stopwatch]]. Others may include [[24-hour analog dials|24-hour analog dial]], [[calendar dates|calendar date]], and [[days of the week]]. A [[wandering hour]] is more for [[design]] rather than an additional purpose. [[Watches|watch]] that [[self-wind|automatic watch]] are also considered to have an added complication. [[Alarms|alarm]] are also present in many watches and [[clocks|clock]]. Other [[measuring devices|measuring device]] not related to [[time]] may also be present, such as a [[thermometer]] or [[compass]], but it is [[debated|debate]] if they should be considered a complication because of their separate nature from the timepiece.</div>
