      <h1>Complication (horology)</h1>
      <div>In horology, a complication is any part or feature in a timepiece that is not for the purpose of displaying hour, minute, or second. One of the most notable timepieces with a complication is a chronograph, containing both a display watch and a stopwatch. Others may include 24-hour analog dial, calendar date, and days of the week. A wandering hour is more for design rather than an additional purpose. watch that automatic watch are also considered to have an added complication. alarm are also present in many watches and clock. Other measuring device not related to time may also be present, such as a thermometer or compass, but it is debate if they should be considered a complication because of their separate nature from the timepiece.</div>
