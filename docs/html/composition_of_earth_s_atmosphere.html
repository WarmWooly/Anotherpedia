      <h1>Composition of Earth's atmosphere</h1>
      <div>See also: Atmospheric chemistry and atmosphere of Earth&spEarth's atmosphere is full of different elements and compounds, composing the air that is used to sustain life. It is notable for the abundance of oxygen that is in the atmosphere. The atmosphere contains roughly 1,007,630,000 cubic miles of air. The following table is ordered based on contribution of each compound and element in the atmosphere based on volume.&p<<tableCompound|Common name|Percentage|Volume (mis-u3)||Ns-b2|Nitrogen|78.084%|r786,798,000||Os-b2|Oxygen|20.946%|r211,058,000||Ar|Argon|&nbsp&nbsp0.934%|r9,411,000||COs-b2|Carbon Dioxide|&nbsp&nbsp0.0407%|r410,000||Ne|Neon|&nbsp&nbsp0.001818%|r18,300||He|Helium|&nbsp&nbsp0.000524%|r5,280||CHs-b4|Methane|&nbsp&nbsp0.00018%|r1,810||Kr|Krypton|&nbsp&nbsp0.000114%|r1,150||Hs-b2|Hydrogen|&nbsp&nbsp0.000055%|r554||Xe|Xenon|&nbsp&nbsp0.000009%|r91table>>&spNote: The percentage adds up to 100.0074% because the values of the more volumous gasses are rounded. The volumes are not an exact calculation but rather a rough estimate based on the assumed volume of the Earth's atmosphere. Values are based on dry air.</div>
