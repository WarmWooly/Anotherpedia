  <div><<shortElements and compounds in Earth's atmosphereshort>>{{tSee also: [[Atmospheric chemistry]] and [[atmosphere of Earth]]}}&sp<<img(src=git/earth atmosphere.jpeg(cap=A [[pie chart]] of the composition of Earth's atmosphere.img>>[[Earth's|Earth]] [[atmosphere]] is full of different [[elements|element]] and [[compounds|compound]], [[composing|composition]] the [[air]] that is used to sustain [[life]]. It is [[notable]] for the [[abundance]] of [[oxygen]] that is in the atmosphere. The atmosphere contains roughly 1,007,630,000 [[cubic miles|cubic mile]] of air. The following table is ordered based on contribution of each compound and element in the atmosphere based on [[volume]].&p<<table{{bCompound}}|{{bCommon name}}|{{bPercentage}}|{{bVolume (mi{{s-u3}})}}||[[N{{s-b2|Dinitrogen]]|Nitrogen|78.084%|{{r786,798,000}}||[[O{{s-b2}}|Dioxygen]]|Oxygen|20.946%|{{r211,058,000}}||[[Ar|Argon]]|Argon|&nbsp&nbsp0.934%|{{r9,411,000}}||[[CO{{s-b2}}|Carbon Dioxide]]|Carbon Dioxide|&nbsp&nbsp0.0407%|{{r410,000}}||[[Ne|Neon]]|Neon|&nbsp&nbsp0.001818%|{{r18,300}}||[[He|Helium]]|Helium|&nbsp&nbsp0.000524%|{{r5,280}}||[[CH{{s-b4}}|Methane]]|Methane|&nbsp&nbsp0.00018%|{{r1,810}}||[[Kr|Krypton]]|Krypton|&nbsp&nbsp0.000114%|{{r1,150}}||[[H{{s-b2|Dihydrogen]]|Hydrogen|&nbsp&nbsp0.000055%|{{r554}}||[[Xe|Xenon]]|Xenon|&nbsp&nbsp0.000009%|{{r91}}table>>&sp{{i{{bNote:}} The percentage adds up to 100.0074% because the values of the more volumous gasses are rounded. The volumes are not an exact calculation but rather a rough estimate based on the assumed volume of the Earth's atmosphere. Values are based on dry air.</div>
