      <h1>Connection</h1>
      <div>For other terms related to connection, see connection (disambiguation).<br>A connection is a physical or concept association between object, people, or idea. Connections, in the physical sense, may be an intermediate object that keeps things together (i.e. a rope knot around a fence is connected to it). Connections may be a recognition of a shared property or state (i.e. seeing how two different objects are the same color). The connection between thing and how they interaction is known as a relationship.</div>
