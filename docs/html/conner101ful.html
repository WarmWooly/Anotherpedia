Conner101ful's history in voice acting began in 2022 when one of his friend at school requested that he record himself shouting "Mug Rootbeer". Conner101ful did so and sent that friend the recording. It was later uploaded to that friend's YouTube channel, which Conner101ful was credited for the voice-over.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt9Bz6flctA (text=refCountref>> This friend would later request more voice recording from Conner101ful. His next appearance would be as Badsmoke (Rufusboy69). The video for this would later become private. The next piece of voice acting Conner101ful did was when that friend requested he make a voice recording of Shadow The Hedgehog.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA3Q34z5M7s (text=refCountref>> That was the last publically released instance of voice acting done by Conner101ful <<asofNovember 2024>>.
As a young child, Conner101ful dreamed of getting into game development. Eventually, much later in his life, Conner101ful would be made to use Scratch (MIT) during one of his classes in school. His first ever game made using Scratch had been a barely functional clicker game centered around Champ99 (Conner101ful) and his money factory. Champ99 would stick to Conner101ful's brain like glue. Future games would be centered around the character of Champ99 and this would later expand into a full-blown animation series on scratch that never made it past 2 episodes and 3 parts of a 3rd episode. In addition to the Champ99 series, side series would be made that added to the lore. Those other side series would never see much development. After the creation of the 2nd episode of the Champ99 series, Conner would make his first playable game titled "Money Factory Mayhem". The game was a top-down bullet hell game. In this game, the player would play as the Scratch Cat (MIT) and would be tasked with dodging a series of simple patterns to progress the game. Later, development would begin on a much more refined variation of the game that was intended to have 6 bosses. That remake would be partially made but never completed. Instead, a new game was being developed called "Champ99 Project 1 ~ The Golden Amulet". This would see active development up until the first boss and was never picked up finished. This led to the development of the Scratch version of Champ99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet, which would get no more than basic movement and a simplistic title screen. Currently, all the Scratch Champ99 projects made by Conner101ful are private.
During his junior year of high school, Conner101ful would take a Computer Science Essentials class, taught by the person who would later make Pickcode. The class had started with block-based coding, which Conner101ful was quite familiar with from his experience in Scratch. His teacher helped Conner101ful out greatly when he wanted to go above and beyond on projects. Later, the class would move beyond the block coding and move into Python (Programming Language). Towards the end of the year, the class was tasked with making a final project. Conner101ful had remembered the Champ99 series and decided to bring it back. His project was intended to be a 1-stage Game Demo of Champ99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet. Conner101ful, ever the star shooter, hit the moon instead, only getting as far as a basic movement demo complete with a "focus mode", "power" mechanics, and two distinct shot types. This project would later receive more development during his senior year of high school as he was taking a Computer Science Principals class. In that class, he learned more about Pygame, which aided in the development of this Champ99 game.
When the seniors of his high school were made to leave and prepare for the graduation ceremony, Conner101ful's development for the 1st installment of the Champ99 Project series would continue in Pycharm (IDE). This development was continued until testing for the bullet hell system for the game. Conner101ful would get incredibly frustrated with it as the game's frame rate would drop rapidly and the sprites for the bullets would become horrifically mangled. He would soon make the switch to the Godot (Game Engine). Rebuilding the game from the ground up again went smoothly. <<AsofNovember 2024>>, the development of Champ99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet is on pause. During the Post-high school stage of development, the lore for the Champ99 Project (Conner101ful) would expand greatly. Conner101ful would also start production of the 4th and final installment of the Champ99 Project series, a book titled Champ99 Project 4: To Hell and Back. The 4th installment of the series reuses and remasters the plot of the 3rd installment of the original Champ99 animated series Conner101ful made on Scratch. <<asofNovember 2024>>, this book is unfinished, but in its final stage of the Drafting (Writing). During this era of his game development career Conner would also start working on a remastering of a Minecraft mod he made between the Early Days era and Post-Scratch era.
The name "Conner101ful" originally stemmed from the original Conner101ful YouTube channel owned by Conner. This channel would be made in 2012 and would consist mainly of Minecraft and Terraria content filmed from his Nintendo 3DS and uploaded to his channel from that very same console. Eventually, the content would move to being made from his computer. The original Conner101ful channel would be deleted due to the creator's own shame of his past works. The channel would soon be remade with the same name in early 2021.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/@conner101ful/videos (text=refCountref>> The videos, <<asofNovember 2024>>, consist of replay file recordings of his gameplay in Touhou Project.
"Conner Lore" refers to the lore surrounding Conner. Conner Lore is mainly an inside joke among his close friends that gets increasingly more absurd with every expansion of the lore. It started after the "Great Falling Out" where Conner left his previous friend group behind after a disagreement involving Conner101ful being seriously romantically attracted to and getting into a romantic relationship with the fictional character of Utsuho Reiuji (Touhou Project). During this period of Conner's life when he was settling himself in a new friend group that the Conner Lore began. At first, it began as Conner being a ghost because of his mic in a Discord call sounding like he was a considerable distance away. This spiraled into him being in The Backrooms and subsequently him transcending reality itself. Conner Lore continues to expand, such as the time he battled his .EXE (Creepypasta) or dabbled in ice cream merchandising. When asked about his personal life, Conner101ful typically answers under the canon of Conner Lore. He does this because it amuses him.</div>
