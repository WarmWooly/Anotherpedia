      <h1>Conner's Wacky Crazy And Quite Possibly Zany Items Mod</h1>
      <div>For the full documentation of the mod, see {{aiCWCAQPZIM guide.}}<br>{{bConner's Wacky Crazy And Quite Possibly Zany Items Mod}} ({{bCWCAQPZIM}}) is a Minecraft mod (Minecraft) developed by Conner101ful. This mod adds new Item (Minecraft), Structure (Minecraft), new Dimension (Minecraft), and more. This mod is the successor to two prior unfinished mods made by Conner101ful. This mod is currently available for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.1 for the NeoForge (Minecraft mod loader) mod loader. The acronym, CWCAQPZIM, is pronounced "swəkakpzɪm".

CWCAQPZIM adds a new weapon type from this mod: the scythe. The scythes are meant to be a combination of the sword (Minecraft) and axe (Minecraft), blending the axe's raw damage and the sword's sweeping ability. The scythe has the cooldown of an axe as well. A scythe can be made from wood, cobblestone (Minecraft), iron ingot (Minecraft), diamond (Minecraft), and Netherite (Minecraft). A scythe can be crafted by placing 3 of the material on the top row of the crafting grid, and 2 stick (Minecraft) in the center and bottom right slots. For a netherite scythe, you must first craft a diamond scythe and then apply a netherite upgrade with a netherite ingot at a Smithing Table (Minecraft).

Originating from Minecraft: Java Edition 20w14∞, the Nendther is brought back in this mod and given new life. This dimension can be accessed by lighting a portal made out of Reinforced Deepslate (Minecraft) using a Nendther Gateway Key (CWCAQPZIM). While it is possible to craft this Nendther Gateway key, it is advised that the player purchase it from the Nendther Expert (CWCAQPZIM) villager (Minecraft). In this dimension, Enderman (Minecraft) can spawn. This dimension is very dark, only being lit up by the occasional patches of bizarre plant life. Rarely, a player may stumble upon a structure containing loot that may prove quite valuable.

A new crop type is added in CWCAQPZIM that can be used to grow various minerals, apple (Minecraft), and blaze rod (Minecraft). Most of these crops are crafted in a smithing table, using a block of that mineral, a specific template, and a base. Apples play a key role in one of the aspects of this mod, so it is advised that players set up a method of farming apples.

Plenty of other items are added by this mod, some more useful than others. From a block of unreasonably condensed emerald to the key to immortality. Some of the more useful items would include the Portable Storage Gap (CWCAQPZIM) and Grand Experience Bottle (CWCAQPZIM). For players interested in flexing on people, there are plenty of items for that as well, such as the One Very Expensive Bookshelf (CWCAQPZIM), the Enchanted Netherite Block (CWCAQPZIM), and The Apple of Minecraft (CWCAQPZIM).</div>
