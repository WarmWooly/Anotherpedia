      <h1>Conservapedia</h1>
      <div>Conservapedia is an American Conservative political online encyclopedia, which can be found at <<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com(text=www.conservapedia.comlink>>. Its name is a combination of conservative and encyclopedia. Its logo is a circle with the American flag and "Conservapedia" sprawled across it, with the subtext "The Trustworthy Encyclopedia." Conservapedia also takes fundamentalist Christian values for articles posted on the site. Conservapedia was created on November 21, 2006, by Andrew Schlafly, to combat the libral bias in Wikipedia and the mobocracy which is claimed to be prevalent on Wikipedia by Conservapedia. The creator of Conservapedia compared it as the "Fox News" to Wikipedia.</div>
