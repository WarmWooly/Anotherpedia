  <h1>Conservapedia and NATO</h1>
  <div><<shortConservapedia's covering of NATOshort>>{{tConservapedia is a publically editable encyclopedia and points made are not directly Conservapedia's stances on topics.}}&sp<<img(src=git/conservapedia and nato.png(cap=Growth of misinformation.img>>[[Conservapedia]] is an [[online encyclopedia]] that covers many [[American]] [[Conservative|Conservative (American politics)]] [[politics|American politics]], including the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), which the [[United States]] is apart of. NATO also serves as a union between 32 [[countries|country]] (<<asofNovember 2024>>) which NATO claims to protect the [[freedom|free country]] and [[security|national security]] of its members.<<ref(content=link|https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_68144.htm(text=refCountref>> However, Conservapedia's coverage of NATO has been repeatedly strained due to topics including [[Russia|Russia and NATO]], [[LGBTQ communities|LGBTQ and NATO]], and [[fascism|Fascism and NATO]].&pWithin <<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization(text=Conservapedia's article on NATOlink>>, many [[claims|claim]] are made in the opening alone, including that NATO is lead by the United States and the other member countries are "[[vessel states|vessel state]]", NATO is pushing the [[homosexual]] agenda, and that [[Russophobia]] is used to justify NATO. NATO was created by the [[United Kingdom]] to bypass the United States relative isolation in global conflicts, as noted in [[WWI|World War I]] and [[II|World War II]]. The [[history]] of NATO as transcribed from Conservapedia claims that despite [[Communism]] being removed from the region after the [[fall of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], NATO has repeatedly pushed the [[Russian Federation|Russian Federation]] away from NATO. The United States is referred to as "The US Empire", continuing to claim that the United States controls NATO.&pIn a [[timeline]] in Conservapedia, it says that between 2014--2024, an [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Russians]] from [[Donbas]] was occurring from the "NATO-backed" [[Azov Brigade]]. The idea that NATO started a war in [[Ukraine]] is repeated multiple times, with an entire article dedicated to such as the "<<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com/NATO_war_in_Ukraine(text=NATO war in Ukrainelink>>".<<note(content=NATO did not start a war in Ukraine.(text=noteCountnote>> Many points in the article are among pro-Russian stances, defending the idea that the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] was not Russia's fault and that Ukraine is corrupt. This includes claiming that Ukraine and its allies are [[neo-Nazis|neo-Nazi]], the United States set up the outcome of the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election]], the [[annexation of Crimea|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] is not related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the [[2022 missile explosion in Poland]] was a planned attack by Ukraine and the United States, and the [[Nord Stream pipelines sabotage]] was [[terrorism]] against Russia and used to make other NATO countries "freeze" in the winter. Overall, the majority of Conservapedia's discussion of NATO is moreso a means of describing why it is bad for the member nations to oppose the active, open, repeated hostilities from Russia against Ukraine, using [[fascism]] as a [[scapegoat]] for why Ukraine shouldn't be defended.</div>
