  <h1>Conservapedia and NATO</h1>
  <div>Conservapedia is a publically editable encyclopedia and points made are not directly Conservapedia's stances on topics.&spConservapedia is an online encyclopedia that covers many American Conservative (American politics) American politics, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which the United States is apart of. NATO also serves as a union between 32 country (<<asofNovember 2024>>) which NATO claims to protect the free country and national security of its members.<<ref(content=link|https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_68144.htm(text=refCountref>> However, Conservapedia's coverage of NATO has been repeatedly strained due to topics including Russia and NATO, LGBTQ and NATO, and Fascism and NATO.&pWithin <<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization(text=Conservapedia's article on NATOlink>>, many claim are made in the opening alone, including that NATO is lead by the United States and the other member countries are "vessel state", NATO is pushing the homosexual agenda, and that Russophobia is used to justify NATO. NATO was created by the United Kingdom to bypass the United States relative isolation in global conflicts, as noted in World War I and World War II. The history of NATO as transcribed from Conservapedia claims that despite Communism being removed from the region after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, NATO has repeatedly pushed the Russian Federation away from NATO. The United States is referred to as "The US Empire", continuing to claim that the United States controls NATO.&pIn a timeline in Conservapedia, it says that between 2014--2024, an ethnic cleansing of Russians from Donbas was occurring from the "NATO-backed" Azov Brigade. The idea that NATO started a war in Ukraine is repeated multiple times, with an entire article dedicated to such as the "<<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com/NATO_war_in_Ukraine(text=NATO war in Ukrainelink>>".<<note(content=NATO did not start a war in Ukraine.(text=noteCountnote>> Many points in the article are among pro-Russian stances, defending the idea that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was not Russia's fault and that Ukraine is corrupt. This includes claiming that Ukraine and its allies are neo-Nazi, the United States set up the outcome of the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation is not related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2022 missile explosion in Poland was a planned attack by Ukraine and the United States, and the Nord Stream pipelines sabotage was terrorism against Russia and used to make other NATO countries "freeze" in the winter. Overall, the majority of Conservapedia's discussion of NATO is moreso a means of describing why it is bad for the member nations to oppose the active, open, repeated hostilities from Russia against Ukraine, using fascism as a scapegoat for why Ukraine shouldn't be defended.</div>
