      <h1>Consumables (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Consumables are single-use cards in Balatro that can be used to modify the deck, create money, Jokers, and other Consumables, or upgrade hands. There are three types of Consumables: Tarot Cards, Planet Cards, and Spectral Cards. They can be obtained through a wide variety of means, such as directly from The Shop and in Booster Packs, effects from Jokers, created through Seals, from Tags from skipping Blinds, or from the Tarot Cards The Fool (0), The High Priestess (II), or The Emperor (IV).<br><br>Consumables are one of the most important cards for the player during a run, as they are the most able to directly interact with the player's deck. They can also generate random Jokers and create money, allowing the player to continue boosting their build. The Spectral Card The Soul is the only way to unlock the five Legendary Jokers in Balatro. The Tarot Cards and Planet Cards are considered to be of less value compared to the Spectral Cards, as they are easier to obtain and use. Spectral Cards, on the other hand, are much riskier, often having a cost (such as removing cards or Jokers) to balance their benefits.</div>
