  <h1>Consumables ({{iBalatro}})</h1>
  <div><<shortDeck-building and upgrading cards in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/balatro consumables.png(cap=From top to bottom: Tarot Cards, Planet Cards, and Spectral Cards.img>>{{bConsumables}} are single-use cards in {{iBalatro}} that can be used to modify the [[deck|deck (Balatro)]], create [[money|money (Balatro)]], [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]], and other Consumables, or upgrade [[hands|poker hand (Balatro)]]. There are three types of Consumables: [[Tarot Cards|Tarot Cards (Balatro)]], [[Planet Cards|Planet Cards (Balatro)]], and [[Spectral Cards|Spectral Cards (Balatro)]]. They can be obtained through a wide variety of means, such as directly from [[The Shop|The Shop (Balatro)]] and in [[Booster Packs|Booster Packs (Balatro)]], effects from Jokers, created through [[Seals|Seals (Balatro)]], from [[Tags|Tags (Balatro)]] from skipping [[Blinds|Blind (Balatro)]], or from the Tarot Cards [[The Fool (0)|The Fool (Balatro)]], [[The High Priestess (II)|The High Priestess (Balatro)]], or [[The Emperor (IV)|The Emperor (Balatro)]].&pConsumables are one of the most important cards for the player during a [[run|run (Balatro)]], as they are the most able to directly interact with the player's deck. They can also generate random Jokers and create money, allowing the player to continue boosting their build. The Spectral Card [[The Soul|The Soul (Balatro)]] is the only way to unlock the five Legendary Jokers in {{iBalatro}}. The Tarot Cards and Planet Cards are considered to be of less value compared to the Spectral Cards, as they are easier to obtain and use. Spectral Cards, on the other hand, are much riskier, often having a cost (such as removing cards or Jokers) to balance their benefits.</div>
