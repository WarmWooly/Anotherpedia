      <h1>Conveyor Manager (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info|||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Axe preferred)||Blast resistance|3||Hardness|1.5||Luminous|No||Transparent|No||Flammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The conveyor manager is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to redirect and split items on chain conveyors.
The conveyor manager can be crafted with 4 rose gold ingots, 4 spool blocks, and 1 crude engine (place the engine in the middle, the spool blocks on the sides, and the rose gold in the corners; makes 4).
The conveyor manager will detect chain conveyors in any of the cardinal directions from the block. Right-clicking the conveyor manager will open up its menu. Each direction can be set to codeDisabled for no action, codeInput for items to be taken from, and codeOutput for items to be placed to. If there are no codeOutputs, no items will be taken from codeInputs. Valid codeInputs (if a conveyor is adjacent to the side) will have an orange particle effect, and valid codeOutputs will have a green particle effect. If there is an codeInput or codeOutput assigned but no valid conveyor, a white particle effect will be displayed. Particles can be disabled using the "Particles" button.&pEach item stack will be moved to a valid codeOutput. If there is only one codeOutput, all items will exit from it. Multiple codeOutputs has each item stack exit to the next valid codeOutput, rotating clockwise. For example, if there is an codeInput from "North", and three codeOutputs from "East", "South", and "West", this is the expected behavior:<<tableItem Stack #|{{bOutput||r1|East||r2|South||r3|West||r4|East||r5|Southtable>>
In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 conveyor manager can fuel for 20 seconds (2 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (64 conveyor managers, 1280 seconds, 128 items).
