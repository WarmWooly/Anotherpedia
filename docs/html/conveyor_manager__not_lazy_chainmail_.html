  <h1>Conveyor Manager (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div><<info|||{{bStats}}||{{bRarity (Minecraft)}}|Common||{{bStack size (Minecraft)}}|64||{{bTool to destroy}}|N/A (Axe (Minecraft) preferred)||{{bblast resistance (Minecraft)}}|3||{{bhardness (Minecraft)}}|1.5||{{bLuminous (Minecraft)}}|No||{{bOpacity (Minecraft)}}|No||{{bFlammable (Minecraft)}}|No||{{bFire-resistant item (Minecraft)}}|Noinfo>>The {{bconveyor manager}} is a block (Minecraft) in the {{iMinecraft}} mod (Minecraft) {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}} used to redirect and split item (Minecraft) on chain conveyors (Not Lazy Chainmail).
The conveyor manager can be crafting (Minecraft) with 4 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 4 spool block (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 1 crude engine (Not Lazy Chainmail) (place the engine in the middle, the spool blocks on the sides, and the rose gold in the corners; makes 4).
The conveyor manager will detect chain conveyors (Not Lazy Chainmail) in any of the cardinal directions from the block. Right-clicking the conveyor manager will open up its menu. Each direction can be set to {{codeDisabled}} for no action, {{codeInput}} for items to be taken from, and {{codeOutput}} for items to be placed to. If there are no {{codeOutputs}}, no items will be taken from {{codeInputs}}. Valid {{codeInputs}} (if a conveyor is adjacent to the side) will have an orange particle effect, and valid {{codeOutputs}} will have a green particle effect. If there is an {{codeInput}} or {{codeOutput}} assigned but no valid conveyor, a white particle effect will be displayed. Particles can be disabled using the "Particles" button.&pEach item stack will be moved to a valid {{codeOutput}}. If there is only one {{codeOutput}}, all items will exit from it. Multiple {{codeOutputs}} has each item stack exit to the next valid {{codeOutput}}, rotating clockwise. For example, if there is an {{codeInput}} from "North", and three {{codeOutputs}} from "East", "South", and "West", this is the expected behavior:<<table{{bItem Stack #|{{bOutput}}||{{r1}}|East||{{r2}}|South||{{r3}}|West||{{r4}}|East||{{r5}}|Southtable>>
In a furnace (Minecraft), blast furnace (Minecraft), or smoker (Minecraft), 1 conveyor manager can fuel for 20 second (2 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (Minecraft) (64 conveyor managers, 1280 seconds, 128 items).
