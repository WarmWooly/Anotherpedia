Right-clicking the conveyor warper will open up its menu. Its range is shown with a line of white particle effects if no chain conveyor is connected. The direction items and players are teleported from, when connected, will have orange particles, while the direction items and players are teleported to, when connected, will have green particles. The maximum range is based on the [[industrial belt|industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] used, but the conveyor warper will only connect to the closest chain conveyors available. Teleporting items and players will cost durability on the industrial belt used. The conveyor warper will ignore all obstructions, allowing for items and players to be teleported through blocks. Particles can be set to only appear on the start/end locations or disabled using the "Particles" button. The direction of the conveyor warper can be changed between warping up or down using the "Direction" button.<<img(src=git/conveyor warper teleporting nlc.gif(cap=The conveyor warper teleporting items.img>><<hr3Rangehr3>>The maximum range of the conveyor warper is based on its industrial belt, which is based on the distance in blocks from the top and bottom of the conveyor warper. For example, if the conveyor warper has a range of 2 blocks, the maximum distance from the conveyor warper to the chain conveyor is 2 blocks, while the maximum distance between chain conveyors is 4 blocks. The following table are the ranges based on the inserted industrial belts:<<table{{bBelt}}|{{bMax Range}}|{{bMax Distance}}||[[Kelp|Kelp Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r2 blocks}}|{{r4 blocks}}||[[Leather|Leather Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r2 blocks}}|{{r4 blocks}}||[[Copper|Copper Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r4 blocks}}|{{r8 blocks}}||[[Iron|Iron Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r6 blocks}}|{{r12 blocks}}||[[Gold|Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r8 blocks}}|{{r16 blocks}}||[[Rose gold|Rose Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r16 blocks}}|{{r32 blocks}}||[[Netherite|Netherite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r32 blocks}}|{{r64 blocks}}||[[Iron composite|Iron Composite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r64 blocks}}|{{r128 blocks}}table>><<hr2Advancementshr2>>If the player gets teleported upwards by 100 blocks using the conveyor warper, the player will be awarded the [[advancement|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Beam Me Up!|Beam Me Up!
