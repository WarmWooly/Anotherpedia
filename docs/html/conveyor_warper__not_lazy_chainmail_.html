      <h1>Conveyor Warper (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Pickaxe preferred)||Blast resistance|1||Hardness|0.3||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The conveyor warper is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to teleport items and players between chain conveyors vertically.
The conveyor warper can be crafted with 2 chain conveyors, 2 iron composite ingots, and 1 telemagnetic alloy (place the alloy in the middle, then the iron composite above and below, and the conveyors to the left and right).
The conveyor warper will detect the closest chain conveyor within its range above and below it to teleport items and players between the chain conveyors. Right-clicking the conveyor warper will open up its menu. Its range is shown with a line of white particle effects if no chain conveyor is connected. The direction items and players are teleported from, when connected, will have orange particles, while the direction items and players are teleported to, when connected, will have green particles. The maximum range is based on the industrial belt used, but the conveyor warper will only connect to the closest chain conveyors available. Teleporting items and players will cost durability on the industrial belt used. The conveyor warper will ignore all obstructions, allowing for items and players to be teleported through blocks. Particles can be set to only appear on the start/end locations or disabled using the "Particles" button. The direction of the conveyor warper can be changed between warping up or down using the "Direction" button.
The maximum range of the conveyor warper is based on its industrial belt, which is based on the distance in blocks from the top and bottom of the conveyor warper. For example, if the conveyor warper has a range of 2 blocks, the maximum distance from the conveyor warper to the chain conveyor is 2 blocks, while the maximum distance between chain conveyors is 4 blocks. The following table are the ranges based on the inserted industrial belts:<<tableBelt|Max Range|Max Distance||Kelp|r2 blocks|r4 blocks||Leather|r2 blocks|r4 blocks||Copper|r4 blocks|r8 blocks||Iron|r6 blocks|r12 blocks||Gold|r8 blocks|r16 blocks||Rose gold|r16 blocks|r32 blocks||Netherite|r32 blocks|r64 blocks||Iron composite|r64 blocks|r128 blockstable>>
If the player gets teleported upwards by 100 blocks using the conveyor warper, the player will be awarded the advancement Beam Me Up!</div>
