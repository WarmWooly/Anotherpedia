Copper chainmail armor enchanted with Chain Repair will automatically take a copper chain link from the inventory to repair durability when the wearer takes damage. Chain Repair can go up to IV, adding 2, 4, 8, and 12 durability per chain link consumed for levels I-IV respectively. The chain link will only be consumed when the maximum value of the chain link can be repaired.
Copper chain links can be converted into Forge Energy in a chain generator. Using an iron composite chainmail industrial belt constantly fed with copper chain links, 5 FE/t can be generated.
