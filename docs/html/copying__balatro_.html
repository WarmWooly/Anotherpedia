  <h1>Copying ({{iBalatro}})</h1>
  <div><<shortCopying another Joker's effect in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/copying balatro.png(cap=The Jokers with a copying effect.img>>{{bCopying}} is a [[Joker|Jokers (Balatro)]] effect that copies another Joker's effect in {{i[[Balatro]]}}. The only Jokers with this effect are [[Blueprint|Blueprint (Balatro)]] and [[Brainstorm|Brainstorm (Balatro)]]. If the effect to be copied is a [[sell effect|sell effect (Balatro)]] (such as [[Diet Cola|Diet Cola (Balatro)]] or [[Luchador|Luchador (Balatro)]]), selling the Joker copying it will trigger the effect. Blueprint copies the Joker to its right, while Brainstorm copies the leftmost Joker. Blueprints and Brainstorms can copy other Blueprints/Brainstorms, allowing for the copy effect to be stacked. [[Debuffed|Debuff (Balatro)]] Jokers, Joker [[Editions|Editions (Balatro)]], and [[Stickers|Stickers (Balatro)]] are not copied.<<hrUncopyablehr>>29 out of the 150 Jokers cannot be copied through a copying effect.
