      <h1>Copying (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Copying is a Joker effect that copies another Joker's effect in Balatro. The only Jokers with this effect are Blueprint and Brainstorm. If the effect to be copied is a sell effect (such as Diet Cola or Luchador), selling the Joker copying it will trigger the effect. Blueprint copies the Joker to its right, while Brainstorm copies the leftmost Joker. Blueprints and Brainstorms can copy other Blueprints/Brainstorms, allowing for the copy effect to be stacked. Debuffed Jokers, Joker Editions, and Stickers are not copied.
