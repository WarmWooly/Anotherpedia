      <h1>Copying (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Copying is a Jokers (Balatro) effect that copies another Joker's effect in Balatro. The only Jokers with this effect are Blueprint (Balatro) and Brainstorm (Balatro). If the effect to be copied is a sell effect (Balatro) (such as Diet Cola (Balatro) or Luchador (Balatro)), selling the Joker copying it will trigger the effect. Blueprint copies the Joker to its right, while Brainstorm copies the leftmost Joker. Blueprints and Brainstorms can copy other Blueprints/Brainstorms, allowing for the copy effect to be stacked. Debuff (Balatro) Jokers, Joker Editions (Balatro), and Stickers (Balatro) are not copied.

29 out of the 150 Jokers cannot be copied through a copying effect.
