      <h1>Copypasta</h1>
      <div>Copypasta, derived from copy and pasta (a play on paste), is an internet phenomenon where text is copied and pasted across chatrooms, forumns, text messaging applications, and other locations where people can openly communicate online. Most copypastas are surrounded in irony, making a joke based on an interaction, object, person, or character. They are bombastic and flashy, with the main goal to confuse readers. A significant portion of copypastas are defamitory and use profanity for an increased shock factor.</div>
