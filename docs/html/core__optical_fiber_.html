      <h1>Core (optical fiber)</h1>
      <div>A core in an optical fiber is the centermost piece, surrounded by a cladding, a coating, sometimes a strength member, and a jacket. The core is made of glass or transparent plastic to allow light to pass through, with the cladding refracting the light as it passes through the core.</div>
