      <h1>Corunchi</h1>
      <div>Corunchi is a stuffed animal by itemLabel which slightly resembles a bat that stands roughly 9 inches tall. <<AsofJuly 2024>>, Corunchi costs $30.00 to purchase.

He has a purple, rotund body with four yellow legs, one in the front, two to the sides, and one in the back. He also has a small dot left eye and a large right eye. He has a yellow beak and a large blue patch across his stomach, which covers an eye of the same size, as well as a large black stitching on the upper right of his back. He has a blue tail with a sharp point on the end, alongside a pair of black wings protruding from the sides. He has a pair of ears on the top of his body, with a green square left ear and a red circle right ear. There is a white filling of the same shape facing outwards inside the ears.

Corunchi has little resemblance to real animals. He has allergies, which are currently unknown. Both his right eye and hidden eye both itch, with the hidden one turning red occasionally. He does not need to wear clothes.

Corunchi is known to lurk on delivered food on doorsteps. He does not understand that what he is doing is theft, thinking that the food is free for the taking. His favorite food is fettuccine Alfredo. He has been caught on camera in a convenience store stealing food as well, alongside breaking into homes. He has been said to be a nice person, but this is debatable because the unknown third party has not been a victim of Corunchi's crimes.

Main page: a Description of Corunchi<br>There has been a musical documentary titled "a Description of Corunchi", which was produced by Wenamun and published by itemLabel on their YouTube channel of the same name, which as the title suggests, describes who Corunchi is.</div>
