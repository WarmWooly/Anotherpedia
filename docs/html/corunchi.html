  <h1>Corunchi</h1>
  <div><<shortStuffed animal by itemLabelshort>><<img(src=git/corunchi.png(cap=Corunchi.img>>{{bCorunchi}} is a [[stuffed animal]] by [[itemLabel]] which slightly resembles a [[bat]] that stands roughly 9 [[inches|inch]] tall. <<AsofJuly 2024>>, Corunchi costs $30.00 to [[purchase]].<<hrAppearancehr>>He has a purple, rotund body with four yellow legs, one in the front, two to the sides, and one in the back. He also has a small dot left eye and a large right eye. He has a yellow beak and a large blue patch across his stomach, which covers an eye of the same size, as well as a large black stitching on the upper right of his back. He has a blue tail with a sharp point on the end, alongside a pair of black [[wings|Wing]] protruding from the sides. He has a pair of ears on the top of his body, with a green square left ear and a red circle right ear. There is a white filling of the same shape facing outwards inside the ears.<<hrBiologyhr>>Corunchi has little resemblance to [[real|reality]] [[animals|animal]].

He does not need to wear clothes.<<hrMotiveshr>>Corunchi is known to lurk on [[delivered food|Food Delivery]] on doorsteps. He does not understand that what he is doing is [[theft]], thinking that the [[food]] is free for the taking. His [[favorite]] food is [[fettuccine Alfredo]]. He has been caught on [[camera]] in a [[convenience store]] [[stealing|Shoplifting]] food as well, alongside [[breaking into homes|Burglary]]. He has been said to be a [[nice]] person, but this is debatable because the unknown third party has not been a [[victim]] of Corunchi's [[crimes|Crime]].<<hrDocumentaryhr>>{{tMain page: [[a Description of Corunchi]]}}&spThere has been a [[musical]] [[documentary]] titled "a Description of Corunchi", which was produced by Wenamun and published by itemLabel on their [[YouTube]] channel of the same name, which as the title suggests, describes who Corunchi is.</div>
