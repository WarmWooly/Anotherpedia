      <h1>Cosmic latte</h1>
      <div>Cosmic latte is the name for a color found by astronomers in the Johns Hopkins University. The original paper in 2002 by Karl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry found that the average color of the universe, as observed from Earth, was a greenish-white color, which was later corrected in 2003 where it was found to be nearly white. The hex triplet for cosmic latte is #FFF8E7.</div>
