      <div>Cradily is a barnacle-based Rock and Grass type Pokémon from the third generation.
Cradily has a green body with four legs, a short tail, a long neck, and a head with eight tentacles.

Its head features a pair of fake yellow eye markings above an opening that reveals a pair of yellow eyes within. Surrounding its head are flat, pink tentacles with darkened tips.&pCradily's official size is 4 ft and 11 in., while weighing 133.2 lbs. Shiny Cradilies are magenta instead of green with orange tentacles.&pCradily's name is likely a combination of cradle and lily.
Cradily was an extinct Pokémon from a hundred million years ago until humans revived it. Its diet, as a carnivore, consists of aquatic and beach-dwelling Pokémon. It can extend both its neck and tentacles up to three times their resting size to snatch prey, with the tentacles releasing a digestive acid while it consumes food. Cradily lives in warm shoals by the sea, where it would go onto land to search for and dig up prey while the tide was out. Its heavy body allows Cradily to resist strong ocean currents, but its short legs prevent it from moving fast.
A Cradily has an 87.5/12.5 chance to be male or female. Cradily is the 346th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color green.&pLileep can evolve into Cradily at level 40.</div>
