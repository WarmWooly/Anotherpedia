<<AsofJuly 2025>>, the Cradily Sitting Cuties Plush has a rating of 4.9/5 stars. Multiple reviews suggest that the product is top-heavy due to the design of Cradily's head. Here are a few ratings:&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - John T, 12/03/2023&spCradily is Perfect&spCradily might have a goofy exterior, but is actually sinister, and this plushie captures this perfectly. A little evil. A little silly. Life is not in black and white and neither is Cradily. Very good at sitting on my desk and staring at me! Some could call it judgemental [sic] but I would call it more loving.&pAlso it has nice beans in the legs to make it sit better. 10/10 would buy again!&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Luke R., 03/31/2022&spA fun cheap way to have a plushie of Cradily!&spThese sitting cuties plushies are absolutely incredible. The attention to detail is absolutely astonishing. And for as cheap as they are, they are absolutely worth it. Cradily is one of my favorite Pokémon ever, and to see that it finally gets a plushie, made me really excited. And now that I have it, it's probably one of my favorite things that I've bought in a while. I'm really excited for Gen 5, if we do get that!&p⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Adam B., 04/17/2021&spVery cute and well sized but tips over&spPlushy is very good quality and very cute, however the base is not heavy enough to hold up the rest of the plushie and it tips over. Some sticky putty or scotch tape will do the trick to hold it in place better. The Lileep plush suffers from this same problem.</div>
