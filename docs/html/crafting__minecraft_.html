  <h1>Crafting ({{iMinecraft}})</h1>
  <div><<shortCore mechanic of {{iMinecraft}}short>><<img(src=git/2x2 crafting minecraft.png(cap=The crafting interface in the inventory to make [[torches|torch (Minecraft)]].img>>{{bCrafting}} is a core mechanic within {{i[[Minecraft]]}} where the [[player|player (Minecraft)]] can combine [[items|item (Minecraft)]] together in a specified pattern to make a new item. Crafting can be performed within the [[inventory|inventory (Minecraft)]] or with the [[crafting table|crafting table (Minecraft)]] or [[crafter|crafter (Minecraft)]] [[blocks|block (Minecraft)]]. The main limiting factor for crafting is the size of the crafting grid, which is 2x2 in the inventory and 3x3 within the crafting table and crafter. While basic items can be quickly made in the inventory, most useful items, including [[tools|tool (Minecraft)]], [[weapons|weapon (Minecraft)]], [[armor|armor (Minecraft)]], and [[functional blocks|functional block (Minecraft)]], requires a crafting table or crafter. As a crafting table only costs 4 [[wooden planks|wooden planks (Minecraft)]], it is the first block that players tend to craft in a [[world|world (Minecraft)]] and is often not hard to obtain.&p<<img(src=git/3x3 crafting minecraft.png(cap=The crafting interface in a crafting table to make a [[diamond pickaxe|diamond pickaxe (Minecraft)]].img>>The patterns of items for crafting are called [[recipes|recipe (Minecraft)]], which will automatically be added to the [[recipe book|recipe book (Minecraft)]] after a criteria is met (such as obtaining an [[iron ingot|iron ingot (Minecraft)]] adding iron tools/armor/block recipes or touching [[water|water (Minecraft)]] adding [[boats|boat (Minecraft)]]). Recipes can be used, even if they are not visible within the recipe book, in which case they will be added after crafting. Some recipes are "shapeless", where the items can be placed anywhere within the grid to craft (such as an iron ingot and [[flint|flint (Minecraft)]] making [[flint and steel|flint and steel (Minecraft)]]), while others are "shaped". A [[crafter|crafter (Minecraft)]] can be used to automate crafting through [[redstone|redstone mechanics (Minecraft)]], with [[hoppers|hopper (Minecraft)]] inserting items to be crafted. A crafter can perform all recipes that a crafting table can. </div>
