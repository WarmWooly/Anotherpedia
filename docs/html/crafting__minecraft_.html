  <h1>Crafting (Minecraft)</h1>
  <div>{{bCrafting}} is a core mechanic within {{iMinecraft}} where the player (Minecraft) can combine item (Minecraft) together in a specified pattern to make a new item. Crafting can be performed within the inventory (Minecraft) or with the crafting table (Minecraft) or crafter (Minecraft) block (Minecraft). The main limiting factor for crafting is the size of the crafting grid, which is 2x2 in the inventory and 3x3 within the crafting table and crafter. While basic items can be quickly made in the inventory, most useful items, including tool (Minecraft), weapon (Minecraft), armor (Minecraft), and functional block (Minecraft), requires a crafting table or crafter. As a crafting table only costs 4 wooden planks (Minecraft), it is the first block that players tend to craft in a world (Minecraft) and is often not hard to obtain.&pThe patterns of items for crafting are called recipe (Minecraft), which will automatically be added to the recipe book (Minecraft) after a criteria is met (such as obtaining an iron ingot (Minecraft) adding iron tools/armor/block recipes or touching water (Minecraft) adding boat (Minecraft)). Recipes can be used, even if they are not visible within the recipe book, in which case they will be added after crafting. Some recipes are "shapeless", where the items can be placed anywhere within the grid to craft (such as an iron ingot and flint (Minecraft) making flint and steel (Minecraft)), while others are "shaped". A crafter (Minecraft) can be used to automate crafting through redstone mechanics (Minecraft), with hopper (Minecraft) inserting items to be crafted. A crafter can perform all recipes that a crafting table can.</div>
