  <h1>Crane ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortCrane-centered map in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/crane laser fight.png(cap=The map Crane.img>>{{bCrane}} is a small outdoor [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox Game)]]}} based on [[train yards|train yard]]. Players spawn in one of the four train station-esque corners. A circular train track extends around the whole map, with a train near the crane. The crane has a ladder to its lower floor, with a second ladder to its upper floor. The crane has controls to move its connected crate up, down, forward, and backward. Crates litter the center of the map with a few wires and planks connecting nearby piles. A camp sits by one of the corners, with a [[section house]] beside the track. Reaching the top of the crane will award the [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[Top of the World|Top of the World (Laser Fight)]], while aligning the crane's crate over the train will award the badge [[FIRED!!!|FIRED!!! (Laser Fight)]]</div>
