      <h1>Crane (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Crane is a small outdoor map (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox Game) based on train yard. Players spawn in one of the four train station-esque corners. A circular train track extends around the whole map, with a train near the crane. The crane has a ladder to its lower floor, with a second ladder to its upper floor. The crane has controls to move its connected crate up, down, forward, and backward. Crates litter the center of the map with a few wires and planks connecting nearby piles. A camp sits by one of the corners, with a section house beside the track. Reaching the top of the crane will award the badge (Roblox) Top of the World (Laser Fight), while aligning the crane's crate over the train will award the badge FIRED!!! (Laser Fight)</div>
