  <h1>Cross tree</h1>
  <div>For the spar (sailing) on sailing ship, see crosstrees, and for the investment bank, see Crosstree Capital Partners.&spA cross tree is an artificial Christmas tree that is in the shape of a Christian cross. The tree is often composed of several parts, including a base, two arms, and pieces for the center beam. Attaching Christmas lights, Christmas ornaments, and nail are commonplace additions to a cross tree. Cross trees have been used to show a greater devotion to God in Christianity and Jesus Christ compared to the standard Christmas tree during Christmas.</div>
