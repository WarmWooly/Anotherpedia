      <div>For the spars on sailing ships, see crosstrees, and for the investment bank, see Crosstree Capital Partners.&spA cross tree is an artificial Christmas tree that is in the shape of a Christian cross. The tree is often composed of several parts, including a base, two arms, and pieces for the center beam. Attaching lights, ornaments, and nails are commonplace additions to a cross tree. Cross trees have been used to show a greater devotion to God and Jesus compared to the standard Christmas tree during Christmas.</div>
