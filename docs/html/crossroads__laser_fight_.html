      <h1>Crossroads (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Crossroads is a medium-sized outdoor map in Laser Fight. Players spawn in one of the four houses on the sides of the map with ladders to exit. A pair of perpendicular roads runs between the houses, with several drivable cars clustered near the center. Crossroads is designed to be a flat, mostly unobstructed battlefield for high-action combat without needing to focus on complex movement.
The cars can be entered by walking on top of them, sitting the player down and going into third person. Players can still shoot while driving. Jump (codeSpace) to exit a car.</div>
