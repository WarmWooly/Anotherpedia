  <h1>Crossroads ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortFlat suburban map in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/crossroads laser fight.png(cap=The map Crossroads.img>>{{bCrossroads}} is a medium-sized outdoor [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox Game)]]}}. Players spawn in one of the four houses on the sides of the map with ladders to exit. A pair of perpendicular roads runs between the houses, with several drivable cars clustered near the center. Crossroads is designed to be a flat, mostly unobstructed battlefield for high-action combat without needing to focus on complex [[movement|movement (Laser Fight)]].<<hrCarshr>>The cars can be entered by walking on top of them, sitting the player down and going into third person. Players can still shoot while driving. Jump ({{codeSpace}}) to exit a car.</div>
