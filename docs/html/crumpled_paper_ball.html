      <h1>Crumpled paper ball</h1>
      <div>A crumpled paper ball, crumpled paper, or paper ball is a ball made from a sheet of paper that has been crumple into a sphere shape, often crude. Crumpled paper balls may be made out of frustration, fundamentally ruin the sheet and making it impossible to read without uncrumpling it first. A paper ball made with an 8.5inch x 11" letter (paper size) will be roughly 3" in diameter.<br><br>Depending on how tightly compacted the paper ball is made, it may be slightly springy. As the size of most paper balls is small enough to fit in the palm of the hand, they can be toss. However, due to its unusual shape and light weight, paper balls tend to veer off due to drag, unevenly affecting the ball.</div>
