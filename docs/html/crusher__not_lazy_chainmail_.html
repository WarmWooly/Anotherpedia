The crusher can be crafted with 3 rose gold ingots, 4 cobblestone, 1 block of iron, and 1 piston (place the block of iron in the middle, piston above the iron, fill the bottom row with rose gold, then fill the rest of the grid with cobblestone).



The crusher requires an industrial belt to run, with better belts increasing the speed the crusher can crush. These are the recipes that the crusher can be used to perform:&spBlock of Amethyst --> 4 Amethyst Shards&spPolished Basalt/Smooth Basalt --> Basalt&spPseudorock --> 3 Bedrock Shards&spPolished Blackstone/Cracked Polished Blackstone/Chiseled Polished Blackstone/Polished Blackstone Bricks --> Blackstone&spBlaze Rod --> 2 Blaze Powder&spRaw Cod/Raw Salmon/Tropical Fish/Pufferfish --> 2 Bone Meal&spBone --> 3 Bone Meal&spBone Block --> 9 Bone Meal&spBricks --> 4 Brick(s)&spBrown Mushroom Block --> 2 Brown Mushrooms&spChromatic Mass --> Chromatic Dust&spChromastone --> 2 Chromatic Dust&spClay --> 4 Clay Balls&spDirt --> Coarse Dirt&spCopper Spool Block/Exposed Copper Spool Block/Weathered Copper Spool Block/Oxidized Copper Spool Block/Waxed Copper Spool Block/Waxed Exposed Copper Spool Block/Waxed Weathered Copper Spool Block/Waxed Oxidized Copper Spool Block/Bright Copper Spool Block/Exposed Bright Copper Spool Block/Weathered Bright Copper Spool Block/Oxidized Bright Copper Spool Block/Waxed Bright Copper Spool Block/Waxed Exposed Bright Copper Spool Block/Waxed Weathered Bright Copper Spool Block/Waxed Oxidized Bright Copper Spool Block --> Copper Spool&spDeepslate/Deepslate Bricks/Cracked Deepslate Bricks/Deepslate Tiles/Chiseled Deepslate/Polished Deepslate --> Cobbled Deepslate&spStone/Smooth Stone/Stone Bricks/Mossy Stone Bricks/Cracked Stone Bricks/Chiseled Stone Bricks --> Cobblestone&spCobbled Deepslate --> Deepened Gravel&spDeepened Gravel --> Deepened Sand&spGlowstone --> 4 Glowstone Dust&spSpool Block/Bright Spool Block --> Empty Spool&spEnd Stone Bricks (Minecraft) --> End Stone&spGold Spool Block/Bright Gold Spool Block --> Gold Spool&spCobblestone/Mossy Cobblestone --> Gravel&spNetherrack --> Hellish Sand&spHoneycomb Block --> 4 Honeycombs&spPacked Ice --> 9 Ice&spIron Composite Spool Block/Bright Iron Composite Spool Block --> Iron Composite Spool&spIron Spool Block/Bright Iron Spool Block --> Iron Spool&spTNT/Minecart with TNT --> KABOOM!
