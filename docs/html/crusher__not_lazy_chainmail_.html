      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|4.5||hardness (Minecraft)|4.5||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The crusher is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to crush item (Minecraft).



The crusher can be crafting (Minecraft) with 3 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 4 cobblestone (Minecraft), 1 block of iron (Minecraft), and 1 piston (Minecraft) (place the block of iron in the middle, piston above the iron, fill the bottom row with rose gold, then fill the rest of the grid with cobblestone).
