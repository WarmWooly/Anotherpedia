The crusher can be crafting (Minecraft) with 3 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 4 cobblestone (Minecraft), 1 block of iron (Minecraft), and 1 piston (Minecraft) (place the block of iron in the middle, piston above the iron, fill the bottom row with rose gold, then fill the rest of the grid with cobblestone).
The crusher requires an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better belts increasing the speed the crusher can crush.
