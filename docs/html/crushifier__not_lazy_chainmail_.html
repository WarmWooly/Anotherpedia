      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The crushifier is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used as a modifier for the Cobblestone Generator to produce gravel.
Crushifiers can be crafted using 1 cobblefier, 1 piston, and 1 block of iron (place the cobblefier on the bottom, the iron in the middle, and the piston above).
Crushifiers are used in the following crafting recipes:&spCrush'n'crushifier - 2 crushifiers (shapeless).&spDeep'n'crushifier - 1 crushifier and 1 deepifier (shapeless).&spDeep'n'crush'n'crushifier - 1 crushifier and 1 deep'n'crushifier (shapeless).&spDirt'n'crushifier - 1 crushifier and 1 dirtifier (shapeless).&spEnd'n'crushifier - 1 crushifier and 1 endifier (shapeless).&spHaunt'n'crushifier - 1 crushifier and 1 hauntifier (shapeless).&spWet'n'crush'n'smeltifier - 1 crushifier, 1 smeltifier, and 1 wetifier (shapeless).
Crushifiers, when put in a Cobblestone Generator, will create gravel. Crushifiers take 8x as long to generate one gravel compared to one cobblestone.
When placed in an Expanded Barrel Collector alongside the 51 other cobblefiers, the player will be awarded the advancement Cobblestone is Everything.</div>
