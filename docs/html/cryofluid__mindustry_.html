  <div><<shortFreezing liquid in {{iMindustry}}short>><<img(src=git/cryofluid mindustry.png(cap=Cryofluid.img>>{{bCryofluid}} is a [[liquid|liquid (Mindustry)]] in {{i[[Mindustry]]}} on [[Serpulo|Serpulo (Mindustry)]] and can be obtained through pools of cryofluid tiles<<note(content=Cryofluid as tiles are only available in custom maps.(text=noteCountnote>> on the surface using a [[Mechanical Pump|Mechanical Pump (Mindustry)]] or better or by mixing [[Titanium|Titanium (Mindustry)]] and [[Water|Water (Mindustry)]] in a [[Cryofluid Mixer|Cryofluid Mixer (Mindustry)]]. The description of Cryofluid is the following:<<quoUsed as a coolant in reactors, turrets and factories.quo>>It has an [[Exposiveness|explosiveness (Mindustry)]] of 0%, a [[Flammability|flammability (Mindustry)]] of 0%, a [[Heat Capacity|heat capacity (Mindustry)]] of 90%, a [[Viscosity|viscosity (Mindustry)]] of 50%, and a [[Temperature|temperature (Mindustry)]] of 25%. Cryofluid can be used as a liquid [[ammo|ammo (Mindustry)]], to generate [[power|power (Mindustry)]] in a [[Differential Generator|Differential Generator (Mindustry)]], [[Thorium Reactor|Thorium Reactor]], or [[Impact Reactor|Impact Reactor (Mindustry)]], to create tier 4 and 5 [[units|unit (Mindustry)]], and to boost the fire rate of [[turrets|turret (Mindustry)]]. When touched, either from entering a pool or being shot, it will give the unit the [[Freezing|Freezing (Mindustry)]] effect.</div>
