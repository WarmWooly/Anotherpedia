      <h1>Cube</h1>
      <div>A cube is a 3D shape with 8 vertices connected with 12 lines, making 6 square faces. Each line is the same length and each forms a 90&deg angle. The width and height are equal to its length. The surface area is six times the length multiplied by itself (l{{s-u2}} × 6 or l × w × 6). The volume is the length multiplied by itself twice (ls-u3 or l × w × h).</div>
