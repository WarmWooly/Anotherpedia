      <h1>Culture</h1>
      <div>For the process of growing cells, see cell culture.<br>Culture is the collective art and knowledge of humans within a society, either bound to a region or nation, or as the entirety of humanity. Culture is built around social norms, beliefs, habits, laws, institutions, and power structures. People may be defined by their cultural associations, inheriting aspects of their culture. Enculturation is the process of a person learning the dynamics and aspects of a culture and adapting to such.</div>
