      <h1>DanTDM's comparison of Elnina and Mareep</h1>
      <div>During DanTDM's playthrough of Deltarune Chapter 3, in the video "The Dark World Gameshow | Deltarune Chapter 3 Part 1" uploaded to his YouTube channel on June 21, 2025, he made a comment comparing Elnina to the sheep Pokémon Mareep. 52 minutes and 27 seconds into the video, DanTDM states, "You look like a Mareep", while talking to Elnina in the green room. This is likely due to the similar elements between Elnina and Mareep, including blue skin, a puffy white-ish hair with a curl above the forehead, and a black-and-yellow color scheme. This comparison between sheep and Elnina is corroborated by the game, where Lanino says that "I tried counting sheep for a nap... and all I could imagine was her [Elnina's] face!"</div>
