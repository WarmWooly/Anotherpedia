      <h1>Dead metaphor</h1>
      <div>A dead metaphor is a metaphor that can't be used to obtain the original meaning behind the metaphor because of repetitive and popular use or because of outdated technology or customs. The only way to understand the meaning of the metaphor, idiom, or figure of speech is by either describing the meaning or utilizing context clues of its usage to extrapolate a possible meaning. Dead metaphors may also be used to encompass other terms that have become words, such as the word deadline. Some examples of dead metaphors include "Pull out all the stops", "Break a leg", saying Cut! during filming, and the glove compartment in a car.</div>
