      <h1>Death (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Death is a fail state for the player in Laser Fight (Roblox game), causing them to lose their current streak and any activated buffing kill streak (Laser Fight). Upon death, the player will ragdoll as skulls emerge from their body. If the death is caused by a laser, they will be zapped in place instead. The respawn screen will appear, informing the player of how they met their fate, a respawn button, and a button back to the menu. There are many ways for death to occur, including getting shot by a gun (Laser Fight), fall damage (Laser Fight), reset (Laser Fight), or falling off the map (Laser Fight). Dying for your first time awards the badge (Roblox) ded lol (Laser Fight).

On death, a message will appear on the respawn screen for the player. The following are all the possible death messages:;;What a sad way to go...|git gud|n00b|Worst. Player.

But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse. The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's "Tell us about us" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.|My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104. This is my confession.
