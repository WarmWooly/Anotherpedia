      <h1>Decoration</h1>
      <div>Decoration is an assortment of objects used to look visibly pleasing. Decorations are ubiquitous amongst buildings, landscaping, and infrastructure, to either make it more appealing and/or to construe a theme or message. They may consist of objects purely as decoration, separate from functional elements, or they may be embedded into systems. Decorations are especially popular during holidays and celebrations.</div>
