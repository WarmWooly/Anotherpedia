      <h1>Decoration</h1>
      <div>Decoration is an assortment of object used to look aesthetic. Decorations are ubiquitous amongst building, landscaping, and infrastructure, to either make it more appealing and/or to construe a theme or message. They may consist of objects purely as decoration, separate from functional element, or they may be embedded into systems. Decorations are especially popular during holiday and celebration.</div>
