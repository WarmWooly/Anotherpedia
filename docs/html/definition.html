      <h1>Definition</h1>
      <div>A definition is a statement that describes the meaning of a word or phrase. This is done by using other words to create a criteria for something to be called a specific term.

The following is an example of defining an object:An {{bapple is a fruit that grows from an apple tree.As shown, the term apple requires to be a fruit growing from an apple tree to be called an apple. Many words have multiple definitions, such as the following:A {{bbat is a flight mammal under the order (biology) Chiroptera.<br><br>A bat (sports) is a tool with a handle and a larger solid surface used in sport such as baseball and cricket (sport).}}The example above describes two different conditional sets that can apply for the same term. These conditions aid in determining the use of a term with multiple uses.

Main page: Circular Definition<br>Circular definitions are definitions where the term described must require outside knowledge due to being self-reference or having multiple terms that require each other to be defined. Here is an example using the previous definition of apple:An {{bapple is a fruit that grows from an apple tree.<br><br>An apple tree is a tree that bears apples.You must know what an apple or apple tree is to define the other, making it circular.</div>
