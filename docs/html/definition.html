  <div><<shortMeaning of words or phrasesshort>><<img(src=git/definition.jpg(cap=The definition of [[freedom]] [[highlighted|highlight]] in a [[dictionary]].img>>A {{bdefinition}} is a [[statement]] that describes the [[meaning]] of a [[word]] or [[phrase]]. This is done by using other words to create a [[criteria]] for something to be called a specific [[term]].<<hrExampleshr>>The following is an [[example]] of defining an [[object]]:<<quo{{iAn {{b[[apple]]}} is a [[fruit]] that grows from an [[apple tree]].quo>>As shown, the term {{bapple}} requires to be a fruit growing from an apple tree to be called an apple. Many words have multiple definitions, such as the following:<<quo{{iA {{b[[bat]]}} is a [[flying|flight]] [[mammal]] under the [[order|order (biology)]] [[Chiroptera]].&pA {{b[[bat|bat (sports)]]}} is a [[tool]] with a [[handle]] and a larger solid surface used in [[sports|sport]] such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket|cricket (sport)]].}}quo>>The example above describes two different conditional sets that can apply for the same term. These conditions aid in determining the use of a term with multiple uses.<<hr2Circularityhr2>>{{tMain page: [[Circular Definition]]}}&spCircular definitions are definitions where the term described must require outside knowledge due to being [[self-referential|self-reference]] or having multiple terms that require each other to be defined. Here is an example using the previous definition of apple:<<quo{{iAn {{bapple}} is a fruit that grows from an apple tree.&pAn {{bapple tree}} is a [[tree]] that bears apples.quo>>You must know what an apple or apple tree is to define the other, making it circular.</div>
