  <h1>Demicolon</h1>
  <div>A demicolon is a spoof based on the complexity and limited use of a semicolon (;) made by CollegeHumor created in 2010. The demicolon is comprised of three comma surrounding a period.
Based on an <<link(src=https://www.leslielang.com/how-to-use-the-demicolon/(text=articlelink>> about the demicolon, it was made by a monk from Andorra in 1422. The demicolon connects an independent clause to anything. Yes, ANYTHING. It's basically a literary trump card, beating out all other punctuation. There have been rumor of metacolons and omnicolons, but those have not been seen yet.</div>
