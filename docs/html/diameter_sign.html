  <h1>Diameter sign</h1>
  <div>The {{bdiameter sign}}, also known as the {{bdiameter symbol}}, is a symbol used to represent diameter, being a combination of a circle and a line that crosses through the middle from the bottom left to the top right: ⌀. It is used in technical drawing to convey that the value of a number is to represent the diameter of an object, such as "⌀ 20 in." The letter Ø may be used in the case a typeface does not include the diameter symbol.</div>
