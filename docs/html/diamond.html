      <h1>Diamond</h1>
      <div>For the mineral in the sandbox game aiMinecraft, see diamond (aiMinecraft).<br>A diamond is a form of carbon with the atoms arranged in a crystal structure. Diamonds have the most hardness of any natural material. Because of this, it is commonly used in industrial applications, such as cutting or polishing tools. Although they are more often cut and used to adorn jewelry, or as a sign of wealth, due to their rarity.<br><br>Diamonds are naturally formed deep within the Earth, at very high temperatures and pressures, approximately 1600°C, and 50,000 times the pressure at Earth's surface. At these extremes, the carbon atoms are squeezed so much they bond with other atoms and form diamonds.</div>
