Diamonds have the most hardness of any [[natural]] [[material]]. Because of this, it is commonly used in industrial applications, such as [[cutting|cut]] or [[polishing|polish]] tools. Although they are more often cut and used to adorn [[jewelry]], or as a sign of [[wealth]], due to their [[rarity]].&pDiamonds are naturally formed deep within the [[Earth]], at very high [[temperatures|temperature]] and [[pressures|pressure]], approximately 1600[[°C|celsius]], and 50,000 times the pressure at Earth's surface. At these extremes, the carbon [[atoms|atom]] are squeezed so much they bond with other atoms and form diamonds.</div>
