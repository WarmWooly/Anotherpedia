      <h1>Diamond</h1>
      <div>For the mineral in the sandbox game {{aiMinecraft, see diamond (aiMinecraft).}}&spA diamond is a form of carbon with the atoms arranged in a crystal structure. Diamonds have the most hardness of any natural material. Because of this, it is commonly used in industrial applications, such as cut or polish tools. Although they are more often cut and used to adorn jewelry, or as a sign of wealth, due to their rarity.&pDiamonds are naturally formed deep within the Earth, at very high temperature and pressure, approximately 1600celsius, and 50,000 times the pressure at Earth's surface. At these extremes, the carbon atom are squeezed so much they bond with other atoms and form diamonds.</div>
