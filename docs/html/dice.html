      <h1>Dice</h1>
      <div>Dice are small, semi-rollable objects that are tossed onto tables to get a random number or value. They are often used in things like board games, tabletop RPGs, or luck based games, such as in casinos.<br><br>Dice will be a shape that has the same sides so as to have a equal chance of getting any value on the dice. Traditionally, dice are cubes with dots (also known as pips) adding up to a number on each side, however numbers or symbols may be carved on each side. Dice maybe be abbreviated as a D + (number of sides), such as a D20 or D12. Common shapes of dice include a tetrahedron (D4), cube (D6), octahedron (D8), dodecahedron (D12), or a icosahedron (D20).<br><br>Loaded dice are dice that are in some way messed with to increase or guarantee the chance of rolling a specific value, with things such as rounded faces, inner weights, or off-square faces.</div>
