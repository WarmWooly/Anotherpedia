      <h1>Dictionary of Affixes</h1>
      <div>The Dictionary of Affixes is a website by the etymologist Michael Quinion used to define affixes (prefixes, suffixes and infixes). The website consists of an alphabetically sorted section to find affixes (with J and K combined into one section), alongside information about the website, the webmaster, and other affix-adjacent content. There is also a link to his other website World Wide Words and a donation section.</div>
