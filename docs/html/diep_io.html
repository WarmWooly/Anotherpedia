  <h1>Diep.io</h1>
  <div>{{b{{iDiep.io}}}} is a 2d game top-down perspective multiplayer video game .io game publicly released on August 6, 2016, created by Matheus Valadares, following his popular 2015 project {{iAgar.io}}. In 2021, Addicting Games would purchase ownership. On September 3, 2024, 3AM Experiences would then purchase ownership and contract VexxusArts to continue maintaining the game.&p{{iDiep.io}} is relatively simple gameplay-wise, utilizing emerging mechanics of the sandbox environment to drive situations. Players are in the form of "Tank (Diep.io)", a circle with a rectangular barrel that is directed by the mouse pointer. When the player presses the arrow keys or WASD, they move, and when they left-click, they shoot Bullet (Diep.io). These Bullets can deal damage to objects, including Shape (Diep.io) that float around and other players. Destroying Shapes or Tanks will award the player with Experience (Diep.io), which allows them to Levels (Diep.io) up and upgrade their Stats (Deip.io). They can also periodically obtain Tank Upgrades (Deip.io) that add or change the functionality, such as an increase in fire rate and bullet spread, longer range and increased camera size, or the removal of the barrel altogether to favor ramming into Shapes and Tanks. There is also a Scoreboard (Diep.io) that tracks the player with the most experience in a server, giving an incentive to try and become the best in a given server.</div>
