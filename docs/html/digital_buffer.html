  <h1>Digital buffer</h1>
  <div>A digital buffer, buffer gate, or logic buffer is an electronic component in a electronic circuit that copies its input. It outputs the same bit as its input. The bits are typically implemented as differing voltage levels. Digital buffers do not serve a logical purpose, but rather an electronic one: they can amplify or temper the electrical impedance of a signal depending on its use case. Digital buffers can also be used before a fan-out to ensure the signal doesn't degrade when trying to connect many logic gate. The following is a truth table for the digital buffer:<<tableInput|Output||c0|c0||c1|c1table>></div>
