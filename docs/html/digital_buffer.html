  <div><<shortDelaying logic gateshort>><<img(src=git/buffer gate.png(cap=A symbol to represent a digital buffer.<<ref(content=link|https://logic.ly/lessons/buffer/(text=refCountref>>(brightImgimg>>A {{bdigital buffer}}, {{bbuffer gate}}, or {{blogic buffer}} is an electronic component in a [[circuit|electronic circuit]] that copies its input. It outputs the same [[bit]] as its input. The bits are typically implemented as differing [[voltage]] levels. Digital buffers do not serve a logical purpose, but rather an electronic one: they can amplify or temper the [[impedance|electrical impedance]] of a signal depending on its use case. Digital buffers can also be used before a [[fan-out]] to ensure the signal doesn't degrade when trying to connect many [[logic gates|logic gate]]. The following is a [[truth table]] for the digital buffer:<<table{{bInput}}|{{bOutput}}||{{c0}}|{{c0}}||{{c1}}|{{c1}}table>></div>
