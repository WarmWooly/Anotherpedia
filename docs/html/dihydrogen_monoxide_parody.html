      <h1>Dihydrogen monoxide parody</h1>
      <div>Dihydrogen monoxide parody is the phenomenon of calling water by an unfamiliar name, and then listing properties of water to sound dangerous, despite being normal when worded differently. Some examples are that dihydrogen monoxide can cause suffocation (drowning), erosion of landscape, and accelerated metal corrosion (rusting), while being used in nuclear power plants and an additive in many food products.</div>
