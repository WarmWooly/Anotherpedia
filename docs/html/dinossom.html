This section is not made to accusation {{aiPalworld or PocketPair Inc. of plagiarism or wrongdoing, but rather describe conversation around the character.}}&spThe character design of Dinossom has gone under scrutiny for its similarities to the Pokémon (fictional species) Meganium (Pokémon) and Goodra (Pokémon). The smililarities between Dinossom and Meganium are mostly the idea of plant-based dinosaurs sharing a green body, three-digited limbs, and red petals with a yellow middle. Dinossom's resembalance is closer to Goodra, sharing the same bulky build, curled tail and horns, and facial structure. Despite this, there is no single Pokémon which Dinossom may be inspired from, if any inspiriation from Pokémon was taken at all in the creation of Dinossom's design.</div>
