  <h1>Dinossom</h1>
  <div><<short64th Grass and Dragon element Pal in {{iPalworld}}short>><<img(src=git/dinossom.png(cap=A Dinossom.img>>{{bDinossom}} is a [[dinosaur]]-like [[plant]]-adorned [[Grass|Grass element (Palworld)]] and [[Dragon element|Dragon element (Palworld)]] [[Pal|Pals (fictional species)]] in {{i[[Palworld]]}}.<<hrAppearance and naminghr>>Dinossom has a tall, blobby build, with two arms and legs with three digits each. Its [[claws|claw]] on its hands and feet are a red, while hasing a white belly. Its back is a deeper green, with small plant-like tufts along its tail, which ends in a curl. Dinossom's head consists of a pair of magenta eyes with a short snout, four leaves, four pink metals with a tan underside, and a yellow crown-shaped [[blossom]] on top with six points. It also has two horns hanging backwards, also ending in curls.&pDinossom's name is a [[portmanteau]] of {{idinosaur}} and {{iblossom}}.<<hrGame mechanicshr>>Dinossom is the 64th Pal in the [[Paldeck|Paldeck (Palworld)]]. The [[work suitability|work suitability (Palworld)]] for Dinossom is 2 for [[Planting|Planting (Palworld)]] and 2 for [[Lumbering|Lumbering (Palworld)]].<<hrDinossom Luxhr>><<img(src=git/dinossom lux.png(cap=A Dinossom Lux.img>>Dinossom Lux is an [[Electric| Electric element (Palworld)]] and Dragon element. It is yellow instead of green, with brown leaves, a vibrant red, tan, and pink-topped petals, and a brown blossom. Dinossom Lux is 64B in the Paldeck. Instead of Planting, Dinossom Lux has a work suitability of 2 for [[Generating Electricity|Generating Electricity (Palworld)]].<<hrIdiomshr>>The Paldeck entries for Dinossom and Dinossom Lux describe [[idioms|idiom]] which have been picked up, likely mirroring [[real-world|reality]] idioms that also prodominently utilize [[animals|animal]]. The entry for Dinossom describes the idiom "step on a Dinossom's tail", meaing to [[enrage]] someone. Real-life counterparts would be to "[[get under someone's skin]]" or to "[[drive someone up the wall]]". The entry for Dinossom Lux describes the idiom "struck by a Dinossom Lux's bolt", which means to [[narrowly escape death|near-death instance]]. There are many counterparts to this idiom, such as to have a "[[close call]]", to "[[live to tell the tale]]", to "[[dodge a bullet]]", and to escape "[[by the skin of one's teeth]]".<<hrSimilarity to {{iPokémon}}hr>>{{tThis section is not made to [[accuse|accusation]] {{aiPalworld}} or [[PocketPair Inc.]] of [[plagiarism]] or wrongdoing, but rather describe conversation around the character.}}&spThe [[design|character design]] of Dinossom has gone under [[scrutiny]] for its similarities to the [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] [[Meganium|Meganium (Pokémon)]] and [[Goodra|Goodra (Pokémon)]]. The smililarities between Dinossom and Meganium are mostly the idea of plant-based dinosaurs sharing a green body, three-digited limbs, and red petals with a yellow middle. Dinossom's resembalance is closer to Goodra, sharing the same bulky build, curled tail and horns, and facial structure. Despite this, there is no single Pokémon which Dinossom may be inspired from, if any inspiriation from {{iPokémon}} was taken at all in the creation of Dinossom's design.</div>
