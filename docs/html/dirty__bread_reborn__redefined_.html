      <h1>Dirty (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
      <div>Dirty is an effect (Minecraft) in Minecraft modding (Minecraft) Bread Reborn: Redefined that turns grass block (Minecraft) into dirt (Minecraft) and grants invisibility (Minecraft) while on dirt. The source of dirty is from eating dirt bread (Bread Reborn: Redefined). When the affected mob (Minecraft) walks on a grass block, mycelium (Minecraft), or podzol (Minecraft), it has an 85% chance to turn into dirt, 10% for coarse dirt (Minecraft), and 5% for rooted dirt (Minecraft). While standing on a dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt block, the mob gains invisibility for 10 tick (Minecraft) (0.5 seconds). If the mob enters water (Minecraft) or is under rain (Minecraft), the effect is removed. If the mob is a player (Minecraft), they will be awarded the advancement (Minecraft) Squeaky Clean (Bread Reborn: Redefined).</div>
