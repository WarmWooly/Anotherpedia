      <h1>Dirty (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
      <div>Dirty is an effect in Minecraft mod Bread Reborn: Redefined that turns grass blocks into dirt and grants invisibility while on dirt. The source of dirty is from eating dirt bread. When the affected mob walks on a grass block, mycelium, or podzol, it has an 85% chance to turn into dirt, 10% for coarse dirt, and 5% for rooted dirt. While standing on a dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt block, the mob gains invisibility for 10 ticks (0.5 seconds). If the mob enters water or is under rain, the effect is removed. If the mob is a player, they will be awarded the advancement Squeaky Clean.</div>
