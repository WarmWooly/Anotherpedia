      <h1>Discarding (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Discarding is an action in Balatro to remove cards from the hand. Discarding is most often used to draw from the deck again to get a better hand, but it can also be used to trigger other effects. Up to 5 cards can be selected at a time to be discarded, with each discard costing 1 of the discards. Jokers, Vouchers, Boss Blinds, and other effects may trigger or change the discards and discarding.<<tableName|Type|Effect||Mystic Summit|Joker|+15 Mult when 0 discards remaining||Delayed Gratification|Joker|Earn $2 per discard if no discards are used by the end of the round||Burglar|Joker|When Blind is selected, gain 3 Hands and lose all discards||Faceless Joker|Joker|Earn $5 if 3 or more face cards are discarded at the same time||Green Joker|Joker|+1 Mult per hand played, -1 Mult per discard||Mail-In Rebate|Joker|Earn $5 for each discarded [random Rank], rank changes every round||Drunkard|Joker|+1 discard each round||Trading Card|Joker|If first discard of round only has 1 card, destroy it and earn $3||Ramen|Joker|X2 Mult, loses X0.01 Mult per card discarded||Merry Andy|Joker|+3 discards each round, -1 hand size||Burnt Joker|Joker|Upgrade the level of the first discarded poker hand each round||Yorick|Joker|This Joker gains X1 Mult every 23 cards discarded||Red Deck|Deck|+1 discard every round||Green Deck|Deck|At end of each Round:<br>$2 per remaining Hand<br>$1 per remaining Discard<br>Earn no Interest||Blast Off|Challenge|-1 discard every round||Five-Card Draw|Challenge|+3 discards every round||Golden Needle|Challenge|+3 discards every round, discards each cost $1||Wasteful|Voucher|+1 discard every round||Recyclomancy|Voucher|+1 discard every round||Purple Seal|Seal|Creates a Tarot card when discarded||Garbage Tag|Tag|Gives $1 per unused discard this run||The Hook|Boss Blind|Discards 2 random cards per hand played||The Water|Boss Blind|Start with 0 discards||The Serpent|Boss Blind|After Play or Discard, always draw 3 cards||Blue Stake|Stake|-1 Discardtable>></div>
