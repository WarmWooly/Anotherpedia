      <h1>Discord moderator</h1>
      <div>A discord moderator, or discord mod, is a moderator for a server on Discord. They often are volunteers, however, there are the occasional paid mods. Their main goal is to keep a server safe while keeping users from breaking any rules.&pThey are stereotyped as being obese, rude, strict, power-hungry, and overall antisocial. This includes silencing others in the name of mod disrespect and nitpicking over every violation.</div>
