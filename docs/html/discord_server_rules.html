Rules may be listed in a dedicated text channel, in the description of a channel, as a pop-up on joining, or a combination of these. Rules dictate what content is permitted and what is not. This may include avoiding certain topic, listening to Discord moderator, and punishment for breaking the rules. Common rules include banning spam or NSFW content.</div>
