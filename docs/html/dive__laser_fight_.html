      <h1>Dive (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A dive is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by pressing codeF while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while in the air. When trying to perform a dive on the ground, a slide will be done instead. Diving is useful for cutting through the battlefield and avoiding opponents, giving a large speed boost in a single direction. A dive can be interrupted by wallrunning or by allowing the dive to naturally decay. Holding sprint (codeShift) will increase the duration of the dive. Diving will slow down over time, ending when the dive is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A dive awards 1 exp. A dive costs 10 stamina to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an Ice Ray increases the dive speed multiplier from 5 to 6 and decreases the dive momentum decay from 40% to 30%.

Main page: Combo (aiLaser Fight)

When a dive is done back-to-back, they will be combined together. After 10 dives, a new dive chain will be started. The following is all the back-to-back combinations for sliding:<<tableCombo|Exp||Bidive|r1||Tridive|r1||Quaddive|r1||Quintdive|r2||Sexdive|r2||Septdive|r2||Octdive|r3||Nondive|r3||Decdive|r4table>>

Main page: Lethal ollie/nollie (aiLaser Fight)<br>If the player dives at a high enough speed into a ramp, they can be launched far into the air. While this is often dangerous, leading to the possibility of taking fall damage, it looks pretty sick. If the player manages to launch themselves 100 studs in the air from their dive starting position, a lethal ollie will be preformed, awarding 10 exp and the badge Lethal Ollie.

When chaining a slide into a dive into a second slide into a second dive (slide --> dive --> slide --> dive), a speed demon will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Diving after a wall launch will perform a wall dive, awarding 2 exp. When chaining a vault into a slide into a dive (vault --> slide --> dive), a hop, skip, and a jump will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Performing a fall break after diving will perform a belly flop, awarding 1 exp. While wallrunning, diving will perform a forceful wallrun dismount, awarding 2 exp.</div>
