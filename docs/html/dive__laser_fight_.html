      <h1>Dive (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A dive is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by pressing codeF while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while in the air. When trying to perform a dive on the ground, a slide (Laser Fight) will be done instead. Diving is useful for cutting through the battlefield and avoiding opponents, giving a large speed boost in a single direction. A dive can be interrupted by wallrun (Laser Fight) or by allowing the dive to naturally decay. Holding sprint (Laser Fight) (codeShift) will increase the duration of the dive. Diving will slow down over time, ending when the dive is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A dive awards 1 experience (Laser Fight). A dive costs 10 stamina (Laser Fight) to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an Ice Ray (Laser Fight) increases the dive speed multiplier from 5 to 6 and decreases the dive momentum decay from 40% to 30%.

Main page: Combo ({{aiLaser Fight)}}

When a dive is done back-to-back, they will be combined together. After 10 dives, a new dive chain will be started. The following is all the back-to-back combinations for sliding:<<tableCombo|Exp||Bidive|r1||Tridive|r1||Quaddive|r1||Quintdive|r2||Sexdive|r2||Septdive|r2||Octdive|r3||Nondive|r3||Decdive|r4table>>

Main page: Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>If the player dives at a high enough speed into a ramp, they can be launched far into the air. While this is often dangerous, leading to the possibility of taking fall damage (Laser Fight), it looks pretty sick. If the player manages to launch themselves 100 studs in the air from their dive starting position, a lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight) will be preformed, awarding 10 exp and the badge (Roblox) Lethal Ollie (Laser Fight badge).

When chaining a slide into a dive into a second slide into a second dive (slide --> dive --> slide --> dive), a speed demon (Laser Fight) will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Diving after a wall launch (Laser Fight) will perform a wall dive (Laser Fight), awarding 2 exp. When chaining a vault (Laser Fight) into a slide into a dive (vault --> slide --> dive), A Hop, Skip, And A Jump (Laser Fight) will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Performing a fall break (Laser Fight) after diving will perform a belly flop (Laser Fight), awarding 1 exp. While wallrun (Laser Fight), diving will perform a forceful wallrun dismount (Laser Fight), awarding 2 exp.</div>
