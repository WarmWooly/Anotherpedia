  <h1>Dive ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortAir-based movement action in {{iLaser Fightshort>><<img(src=git/dive laser fight.png(cap=A player diving.img>>A {{bdive}} is a [[movement action|movement (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} triggered by pressing {{codeF}} while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while in the air. When trying to perform a dive on the ground, a [[slide|slide (Laser Fight)]] will be done instead. Diving is useful for cutting through the battlefield and avoiding opponents, giving a large speed boost in a single direction. A dive can be interrupted by [[wallrunning|wallrun (Laser Fight)]] or by allowing the dive to naturally decay. Holding [[sprint|sprint (Laser Fight)]] ({{codeShift}}) will increase the duration of the dive. Diving will slow down over time, ending when the dive is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A dive awards 1 [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]]. A dive costs 10 [[stamina|stamina (Laser Fight)]] to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an [[Ice Ray|Ice Ray (Laser Fight)]] increases the dive speed multiplier from 5 to 6 and decreases the dive momentum decay from 40% to 30%.<<hrComboshr>>{{tMain page: [[Combo ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}<<hr2Chaining diveshr2>>When a dive is done back-to-back, they will be combined together. After 10 dives, a new dive chain will be started. The following is all the back-to-back combinations for sliding:<<table{{bCombo}}|{{bExp}}||Bidive|{{r1}}||Tridive|{{r1}}||Quaddive|{{r1}}||Quintdive|{{r2}}||Sexdive|{{r2}}||Septdive|{{r2}}||Octdive|{{r3}}||Nondive|{{r3}}||Decdive|{{r4}}table>><<hr2Lethal olliehr2>>{{tMain page: [[Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spIf the player dives at a high enough speed into a ramp, they can be launched far into the air. While this is often dangerous, leading to the possibility of taking [[fall damage|fall damage (Laser Fight)]], it looks pretty sick. If the player manages to launch themselves 100 studs in the air from their dive starting position, a [[lethal ollie|lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight)]] will be preformed, awarding 10 exp and the [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[Lethal Ollie|Lethal Ollie (Laser Fight badge)]].<<hr2Other comboshr2>>When chaining a slide into a dive into a second slide into a second dive (slide --> dive --> slide --> dive), a [[speed demon|speed demon (Laser Fight)]] will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Diving after a [[wall launch|wall launch (Laser Fight)]] will perform a [[wall dive|wall dive (Laser Fight)]], awarding 2 exp. When chaining a [[vault|vault (Laser Fight)]] into a slide into a dive (vault --> slide --> dive), [[a hop, skip, and a jump|A Hop, Skip, And A Jump (Laser Fight)]] will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Performing a [[fall break|fall break (Laser Fight)]] after diving will perform a [[belly flop|belly flop (Laser Fight)]], awarding 1 exp. While [[wallrunning|wallrun (Laser Fight)]], diving will perform a [[forceful wallrun dismount|forceful wallrun dismount (Laser Fight)]], awarding 2 exp.</div>
