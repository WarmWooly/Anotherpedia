      <h1>Do a Barrel Roll (Minecraft mod)</h1>
      <div>{{iDo a Barrel Roll}} is a Minecraft mod made by enjarai which adds roll, pitch, and yaw when using an elytra to fly. This allows the player to do many aerobatics, notably the barrel roll. The mod can be run client-side only, but it is recommended to also have it loaded server-side to allow other players to view the aerobatics. Do a Barrel Roll is available for 1.21.5, 1.21.4, 1.21.3, 1.21.2, 1.21.1, 1.21, 1.20.6, 1.20.5, 1.20.4, 1.20.3, 1.20.2, 1.20.1, 1.20, 1.19.4, 1.19.3, 1.19.2, 1.19.1, 1.19, 1.18.2, and 1.17.1.</div>
