  <h1>Don't eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk</h1>
  <div>"{{bDon't eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk}}" is the 36th rule in the book {{iFood Rules: An Eater's Manual}} by Michael Pollan. The saying is used to convey that it is better to avoid cereal that changes the color of milk added to it because of the synthetic food additive in the cereal. It precedes {{iThe whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead}} and comes after {{iEat sweet foods as you find them in nature}}.</div>
