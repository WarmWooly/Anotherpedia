  <h1>Don't eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk</h1>
  <div>"Don't eat breakfast cereals that change the color of the milk" is the 36th rule in the book Food Rules: An Eater's Manual by Michael Pollan. The saying is used to convey that it is better to avoid cereal that changes the color of milk added to it because of the synthetic food additive in the cereal. It precedes The whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead and comes after Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature.</div>
