      <h1>DoucheTuber</h1>
      <div>A DoucheTuber, also written as Douche Tuber, is a YouTuber who relies on shock value and public humiliation, often having an inflated ego. They are rude and often use the thin guise of pranks, skits, and stunts to perform obnoxious acts, with content geared toward children. A common target for DoucheTubers are workers at retail or fast food, alongside the general public, in an attempt to garner views, regardless of backlash. They may also utilize situations that make themselves or their family the target, which children would not understand to be fake. Shouting and heavy use of editing are used to compensate for talent. There have been a plethora of instances where bodily harm or death have occurred, alongside arrests, because of the stunts performed by DoucheTubers.</div>
