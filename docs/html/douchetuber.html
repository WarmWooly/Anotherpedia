      <h1>DoucheTuber</h1>
      <div>A DoucheTuber, also written as Douche Tuber, is a YouTuber who relies on shock value and public humiliation, often having an inflated ego. They are rude and often use the thin guise of prank, skit, and stunt to perform obnoxious action, with content geared toward child. A common target for DoucheTubers are worker at retail or fast food, alongside the general public, in an attempt to garner view (YouTube), regardless of backlash. They may also utilize situation that make themselves or their family the target, which children would not understand to be fake. Shouting and heavy use of editing are used to compensate for talent. There have been a plethora of instances where bodily harm or death have occurred, alongside arrest, because of the stunts performed by DoucheTubers.</div>
