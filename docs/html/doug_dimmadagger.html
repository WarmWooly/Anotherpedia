      <h1>Doug DimmaDagger</h1>
      <div>The Doug DimmaDagger, also known as the Dimmadirk, is a dagger based on the Fairly OddParents character Doug Dimmadome, where the blade is concealed under his tall hat. It was forged by Fluid Forge Blacksmithing and was sold for $115.00 before becoming unavailable. It has a handle in the shape of Doug Dimmadome, where the hat acts as a sheath for the blade. When someone had the DimmaDagger, you know you're going to Dimmadie.</div>
