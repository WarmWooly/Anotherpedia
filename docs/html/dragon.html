      <h1>Dragon</h1>
      <div>A dragon is a mythical flying reptile. They are popular with many cultures worldwide and come in a variety of forms. Dragons in Western culture typically have four legs on a full body, wings, horns, and the ability to breath fire, being well-known for chaos and destruction. Meanwhile, Eastern dragons have a more serpent-shaped body, with shorter legs and are much more often used as a method of describing wisdom and peace.
