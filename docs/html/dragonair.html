      <h1>Dragonair</h1>
      <div>Dragonair is an aquatic reptilian Dragon type Pokémon from the first generation.

Dragonair resembles a serpent with a blue coloring and a white underside. Dragonair has a pair of large eyes that are often reflecting off light with a purple iris. Dragonair also has a snout, a pair of wings on its head, and a sharp horn. Dragonair also has an orb right below its snout and a pair at the end of its tail. Unlike Dratini, Dragonair's body radius is much more variable.<br><br>Dragonair's official size is 13 ft, 1 in, while weighing 36.4 lbs. Shiny Dragonairs are pink in color instead of blue, alongside having golden orbs.<br><br>In the beta, Dragonair was called Dragyn. Dragonair is a direct portmanteau of dragon and air. Dragonair can be shortened down to 'nair.

Dragonair is able to fly, both with and without using its wings. The crystal orbs of unknown material can be used as a conduit to release the energy stored in a Dragonair, mainly to manipulate the weather in a localized area. Dragonairs can be found in large bodies of water, such as lakes and seas.

Dragonair was considered mythical due to its ability to manipulate weather, primarily in agricultural settlements. It is unknown how much value Dragonair's ability was for human development, especially during droughts. Gifts of gratitude are left beside locations where a Dragonair inhabits.<br><br>Despite being more infrequent, Dragonair also sheds its skin. This skin used to be thought of as an enormous Dratini until Dragonair was discovered. Some cultures believe that a sighting of a Dragonair at the beginning of a year will give the viewer great health until the next.

The hexadecimal value for Dragonair in the original games is 59 (89 in decimal). Dragonair has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Dragonair is the 148th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color blue.<br><br>Dragonair evolves from Dratini, which can then evolve at level 55 into Dragonite. Dragonair's leveling rate is "Slow".</div>
