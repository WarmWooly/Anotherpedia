  <h1>Dragonite</h1>
  <div><<short149th Flying and Dragon type Pokémonshort>><<img(src=git/dragonite.png(cap=Dragonite.img>>{{bDragonite}} is a [[reptilian|Reptile]] [[Dragon type|Dragon Type (Pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] from the [[first generation|Generation I (Pokémon)]]. Dragonite is considered a [[Pseudo-legendary Pokémon]].<<hrAppearance and naminghr>>Being similar to a chubby [[dragon]], Dragonite has a tall stature with a pair of arms and legs adorned with three digits each. The body is a rich orange, while the stomach and underside are tanned segments. Dragonite also has a pair of relatively small wings with a cyan inside. Its head consists of a horn above its crown, a pair of wispy, yellow antennae with a thick snout, and a pair of faintly green eyes.&pDragonite's official size is 7 [[ft|foot (unit)]], 3 [[in|inch]], while weighing 463 [[lbs|Pound]]. [[Shiny|Shiny (Pokémon)]] Dragonites are a dull green instead of orange, alongside having purple wings instead of cyan. The color of Dragonite's underside remains the same.&pDragonite is possibly a [[portmanteau]] of {{i[[dragon]]}} and {{i[[knight]]}}.<<hrBehaviorhr>><<img(src=git/dragonite cry.gif(cap=A Dragonite [[crying]].img>>Dragonite is extremely rare living around [[oceans|ocean]]. Dragonite is able to break the sound barrier, with the ability to circle the [[Earth]] in 16 [[hours|hour]], which at around the [[equator]] would require a maximum speed of ~1550 [[mph|Miles per hour]] (slightly faster than [[Mach]] 2). It roughly has [[human]]-level intellect, suggesting an [[EQ|Encephalization quotient]] around 7. Despite a lack of orbs, Dragonite can also change the [[weather]].<<hrHuman interactionhr>>Dragonite, known by locals as a "sea guardian", seemingly has an [[altruistic|altruism]] demeanor. Dragonite has saved [[people]] from [[drowning]], alongside aiding [[ships|ship]] when [[lost]] or [[damaged|damage]]. Because of this, [[figureheads|figurehead (boat)]] of Dragonite have been adorned onto ships. When the [[environment]] is [[threatened|environmental damage]], Dragonite will decimate the harmer. It is unclear if Dragonite harms living things involved in the harm, especially due to the uncontrollable nature of its [[rampage]] when angered.<<hrGame mechanicshr>>The [[hexadecimal]] value for Dragonite in the original games is 5A (90 in [[decimal|decimal (number system)]]). A Dragonite has a 50/50 chance to be [[male]] or [[female]]. Dragonite is the 149th Pokémon in the [[Pokédex|Pokédex (Pokémon)]] and has the Pokédex color brown.&pDragonite [[evolves|evolution (pokémon)]] from [[Dragonair|Dragonair (pokémon)]] at [[level|level (pokémon)]] 55, which evolves from a level 30 [[Dratini|Dratini (Pokémon)]]. Dragonite's leveling rate is "Slow".<<hrMega Evolutionhr>><<img(src=git/mega dragonite.png(cap=Mega Dragonite.img>>When a Dragonite [[holds|held item (pokémon)]] [[Dragoninite]], it can [[Mega Evolve|mega evolution (pokémon)]] into Mega Dragonite, overall increasing its stats. Dragonite takes on a closer appearance to a Dragonair, now sporting a white horn, a longer tail, and a chromatic orb near its end. It also has small white wing "sprouts" on its thighs and shoulders, and a pair of large white feathery wings on its head. Its eyes also become blue, and its underbelly now has fewer, pointed lines. Mega Dragonite's weight increases to 639.3 lbs.</div>
