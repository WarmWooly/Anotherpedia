      <h1>Dragonite</h1>
      <div>Dragonite is a reptilian Dragon type Pokémon from the first generation. Dragonite is considered a Pseudo-legendary Pokémon.

Being similar to a chubby dragon, Dragonite has a tall stature with a pair of arms and legs adorned with three digits each. The body is a rich orange, while the stomach and underside are tanned segments. Dragonite also has a pair of relatively small wings with a cyan inside. Its head consists of a horn above its crown, a pair of wispy, yellow antennae with a thick snout, and a pair of faintly green eyes.<br><br>Dragonite's official size is 7 ft, 3 in, while weighing 463 lbs. Shiny Dragonites are a dull green instead of orange, alongside having purple wings instead of cyan. The color of Dragonite's underside remains the same.<br><br>Dragonite is possibly a portmanteau of dragon and knight.

Dragonite is extremely rare living around oceans. Dragonite is able to break the sound barrier, with the ability to circle the Earth in 16 hours, which at around the equator would require a maximum speed of ~1550 mph (slightly faster than Mach 2). It roughly has human-level intellect, suggesting an EQ around 7. Despite a lack of orbs, Dragonite can also change the weather.

Dragonite, known by locals as a "sea guardian", seemingly has an altruistic demeanor. Dragonite has saved people from drowning, alongside aiding ships when lost or damaged. Because of this, figureheads of Dragonite have been adorned onto ships. When the environment is threatened, Dragonite will decimate the harmer. It is unclear if Dragonite harms living things involved in the harm, especially due to the uncontrollable nature of its rampage when angered.

The hexadecimal value for Dragonite in the original games is 5A (90 in decimal). A Dragonite has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Dragonite is the 149th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color brown.<br><br>Dragonite evolves from Dragonair at level 55, which evolves from a level 30 Dratini. Dragonite's leveling rate is "Slow".

When a Dragonite holds Dragoninite, it can Mega Evolve into Mega Dragonite, overall increasing its stats. Dragonite takes on a closer appearance to a Dragonair, now sporting a white horn, a longer tail, and a chromatic orb near its end. It also has small white wing "sprouts" on its thighs and shoulders, and a pair of large white feathery wings on its head. Its eyes also become blue, and its underbelly now has fewer, pointed lines. Mega Dragonite's weight increases to 639.3 lbs.</div>
