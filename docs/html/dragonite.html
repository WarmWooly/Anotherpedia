  <h1>Dragonite</h1>
  <div>{{bDragonite}} is a Reptile Dragon Type (Pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation I (Pokémon). Dragonite is considered a Pseudo-legendary Pokémon.
Being similar to a chubby dragon, Dragonite has a tall stature with a pair of arms and legs adorned with three digits each. The body is a rich orange, while the stomach and underside are tanned segments. Dragonite also has a pair of relatively small wings with a cyan inside.

Shiny (Pokémon) Dragonites are a dull green instead of orange, alongside having purple wings instead of cyan. The color of Dragonite's underside remains the same.&pDragonite is possibly a portmanteau of {{idragon}} and {{iknight}}.
Dragonite is extremely rare living around ocean. Dragonite is able to break the sound barrier, with the ability to circle the Earth in 16 hour, which at around the equator would require a maximum speed of ~1550 Miles per hour (slightly faster than Mach 2). It roughly has human-level intellect, suggesting an Encephalization quotient around 7. Despite a lack of orbs, Dragonite can also change the weather.
Dragonite, known by locals as a "sea guardian", seemingly has an altruism demeanor. Dragonite has saved people from drowning, alongside aiding ship when lost or damage. Because of this, figurehead (boat) of Dragonite have been adorned onto ships. When the environment is environmental damage, Dragonite will decimate the harmer. It is unclear if Dragonite harms living things involved in the harm, especially due to the uncontrollable nature of its rampage when angered.
