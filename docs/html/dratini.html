      <h1>Dratini</h1>
      <div>Dratini is an aquatic reptilian Dragon type Pokémon from the first generation.
Dratini resembles a serpent with a light blue coloring and a white underside. Dratini has a pair of large eyes that are often reflecting off light with a purple iris. Dratini also has a large snout, a pair of 3-pronged fins/wings on its head, and a flat horn.&pDratini's official size is 5 ft, 11 in, while weighing 7.3 lbs. Shiny Dratinis are pink in color instead of blue.&pEarly on in material promoting Pokémon, Dratini was referred to as Dragoon. It is believed that Dratini may be a portmanteau of dragon and teeny or mini. This is despite the fact that a Dratini is as tall as Walter White.
Dratinis can be found near or inside bodies of moving water. Dratini is considered a bottom feeder, eating food collected at the bottom of the bodies of water. Dratinis are known to shed their skin often due to "life energy buildup". After shedding, Dratinis often hide behind rocks and waterfalls. Dratini glows after shedding its skin.
Dratini used to be considered a mythical creature due to its illusive nature. Shed skins of Dratini were found, but there used to be no definitive evidence. A fisherman has caught a Dratini after a 10-hour struggle, and is considered a recent event in the Pokémon universe. This is paired with a small colony being found, as well as DNA evidence that determines that the shed skins were from Dratini.&pShed skins have been tanned and turned into a luxury commodity. It is unclear if poaching is a threat to Dratini. Some cultures believe that Dratini's horn is a symbol of good luck.
The hexadecimal value for Dratini in the original games is 58 (88 in decimal). A Dratini has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Dratini is the 147th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color blue.
At level 30, Dranini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55, Dragonite. Dratini's leveling rate is "Slow".
