  <h1>Dratini</h1>
  <div><<short147th Dragon type Pokémonshort>><<img(src=git/dratini.png(cap=Dratini.img>>{{bDratini}} is an aquatic [[reptilian|Reptile]] [[Dragon type|Dragon Type (Pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] from the [[first generation|Generation I (Pokémon)]].
<<hrAppearance and naminghr>>Dratini resembles a [[serpent]] with a light blue coloring and a white underside. Dratini has a pair of large eyes that are often reflecting off light with a purple [[iris]]. Dratini also has a large snout, a pair of 3-pronged fins/wings on its head, and a flat horn.&pDratini's official size is 5 [[ft|foot (unit)]], 11 [[in|inch]], while weighing 7.3 [[lbs|Pound]]. [[Shiny|Shiny (Pokémon)]] Dratinis are pink in color instead of blue.&pEarly on in material promoting {{iPokémon}}, Dratini was referred to as {{iDragoon}}. It is believed that Dratini may be a [[portmanteau]] of {{i[[dragon]]}} and {{iteeny}} or {{imini}}.<<safe This is despite the fact that a Dratini is [[as tall as|List of All Pokémon as tall as Walter White]] [[Walter White|Walter White (Breaking Bad)]].safe>>
<<hrBehaviorhr>><<img(src=git/dive.gif(cap=A Dratini [[diving]] out of sight.img>>Dratinis can be found near or inside bodies of moving [[water]]. Dratini is considered a [[bottom feeder]], eating [[food]] collected at the bottom of the bodies of water. Dratinis are known to [[shed|Shedding]] their skin often due to "life energy buildup". After shedding, Dratinis often hide behind rocks and [[waterfalls|Waterfall]]. Dratini glows after shedding its skin.
<<hrMythology and human interactionhr>>Dratini used to be considered a [[mythical|Myth]] creature due to its illusive nature. Shed skins of Dratini were found, but there used to be no definitive evidence. A [[fisherman|Angler]] has [[caught|Catching]] a Dratini after a 10-[[hour]] struggle, and is considered a recent [[event]] in the {{iPokémon}} universe. This is paired with a small colony being found, as well as [[DNA]] evidence that determines that the shed skins were from Dratini.&pShed skins have been [[tanned|Tanning]] and turned into a [[luxury]] commodity. It is unclear if [[poaching]] is a threat to Dratini. Some [[cultures|Culture]] believe that Dratini's horn is a [[symbol]] of good [[luck]].
<<hrGame mechanicshr>>The [[hexadecimal]] value for Dratini in the original games is 58 (88 in [[decimal|decimal (number system)]]). A Dratini has a 50/50 chance to be [[male]] or [[female]]. Dratini is the 147th {{iPokémon}} in the [[Pokédex|Pokédex (Pokémon)]] and has the Pokédex color blue.<<hr2Leveling and evolutionhr2>>At [[level|Leveling (Pokémon)]] 30, Dranini [[evolves|Evolution (Pokémon)]] into [[Dragonair|Dragonair (Pokémon)]], and at level 55, [[Dragonite|Dragonite (Pokémon)]].

It does so because the life energy within its body steadily builds to reach uncontrollable levels. This allows Dratini to grow longer and longer, even reaching 6 feet in length. In some regions, boots made from the tanned cast-off skin of Dratini are a luxury item. The small lump on a Dratini's forehead is actually an underdeveloped horn. Even though it is rare, after a 10-hour struggle, a fisherman was finally able to pull one up and confirm its existence. Though still weak, it dwells near bodies of rapidly flowing water, such as the plunge pools of waterfalls to protect it while it repeatedly sheds its skin. It eats whatever food sinks down, and lives a quiet and happy life.<<hr2Bulbapediahr2>>{{tFor the corresponding Bulbapedia article, see <<link(src=https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dratini_(Pok%C3%A9mon)(text=Dratini (Pokémon)link>>}}&spOn [[Bulbapedia]], Dratini is fully covered in regards to official use in the [[{{iPokémon}} universe]], alongside [[merchandise|Pokémon merchandise]] and other {{iPokémon}}-related matters.
