  <h1>Dratini in a martini</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the beverage, see Dratini (cocktail).}}&sp{{bDratini in a martini}}, also known as {{bDratini on a martini}} or {{bDratini Martini}}, is a play off the elf on the shelf (meme). It is because Dratini (Pokémon) and a martini rhyme, as required by the elf on the shelf meme. 
{{tFor more examples, see Gallery of Dratini in a martini.}}&spBecause of the silly and absurd nature of the meme, alongside the culture powerhouse that is {{iPokémon}}, it causes Dratini in a martini to outlive all other elf on the shelf memes. It has become so widespread that there are artwork, pin, sticker, sculpture, tattoo, and other forms of a Dratini in a martini. The meme about the Dratini in a martini, however, is not connected to the cocktail Dratini (cocktail), where the Dratini is a martini.</div>
