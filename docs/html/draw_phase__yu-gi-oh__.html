  <h1>Draw Phase (Yu-Gi-Oh!)</h1>
  <div>The Draw Phase is the first Phase (Yu-Gi-Oh!) in the Sequential order of a Turn (Yu-Gi-Oh!) in the card game Yu-Gi-Oh! In the Draw Phase, the Turn Player (Yu-Gi-Oh!) will start their turn by conducting their Normal Draw (Yu-Gi-Oh!). After Master Rules (Yu-Gi-Oh!) 3, the player that goes first does not conduct their Normal Draw during their Draw Phase. Effects (Yu-Gi-Oh!) that are Spell Speed (Yu-Gi-Oh!) 2 or higher can be Activate (Yu-Gi-Oh) during the Draw Phase after the turn player has conducted their normal draw.</div>
