      <h1>Draw Phase (Yu-Gi-Oh!)</h1>
      <div>The Draw Phase is the first phase in the order of a turn in the game Yu-Gi-Oh! In the Draw Phase, the turn player will start their turn by conducting their normal draw. After Master Rule 3, the player that goes first does not conduct their Normal Draw during their Draw Phase. Effects that are Spell Speed 2 or higher can be activated during the Draw Phase after the turn player has conducted their normal draw.</div>
