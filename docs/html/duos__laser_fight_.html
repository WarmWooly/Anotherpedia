      <div>Duos is a coop in Laser Fight where players join into 8 teams of 2. When selecting a team, other players will be able to view who has joined. The teams are red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, and cyan. Players can't join filled teams. Teammates can't be harmed by each other's bullets from guns or from streaks (such as Turret or Nuke).</div>
