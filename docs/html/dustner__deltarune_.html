      <h1>Dustner (Deltarune)</h1>
      <div>This page contains spoiler for the video game {{aiDeltarune.}}<br>A Dustner is a fan term from Deltarune for Darkner (Deltarune) whose Light World (Deltarune) form are of a Monster (Deltarune) monster dust (Deltarune), which is comparable to a corpse for when a monster dies. While it used to be a Deltarune predictions that a Darkner would be made of dust, it was confirmed upon the release of Deltarune Chapter 4 where the character Gerson (Deltarune) appeared in a Dark World (Deltarune). In the Light World, Gerson is deceased and only a pile of dust, proving that Darkners can come from a monster's dust, and the effects of a Dark World can even "revive" a monster for the duration of the Dark World's existence.</div>
