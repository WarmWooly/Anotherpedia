      <h1>Dustner (Deltarune)</h1>
      <div>This page contains spoilers for the game {{aiDeltarune.}}<br>A Dustner is a fan term from Deltarune for Darkners whose Light World form are of a monster's dust, which is comparable to a corpse for when a monster dies. While it used to be a prediction that a Darkner would be made of dust, it was confirmed upon the release of Chapter 4 where the character Gerson appeared in a Dark World. In the Light World, Gerson is deceased and only a pile of dust, proving that Darkners can come from a monster's dust, and the effects of a Dark World can even "revive" a monster for the duration of the Dark World's existence.</div>
