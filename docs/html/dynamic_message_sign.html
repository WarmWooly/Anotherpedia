      <h1>Dynamic message sign</h1>
      <div>A dynamic message sign, also known as a variable message sign, abbreviation as DMS or VMS respectively, is an electronic sign used as a warning for traffic, routing information, safety information, and other important knowledge.

A DMS has two phases, or Frame, that can be displayed at a time. The two phases will alternate, but not both phases are needed for a message to get across. Phases should only be used when needed. The time between each phase is determined by how long it takes to read a message and the speed of traffic, alongside sign visibility.<br><br>The message on each phase should be able to be understood separately. There is never a case to use three or more phases.

There are also guidelines for the messages to be displayed on a DMS. The main goal is for drivers to be able to quickly make a decision with the new information. Abbreviations should be used sparingly to avoid confusion. Attempt to prevent two abbreviations in a row, and never have three in a row.<br><br>Messages are used as an early warning, for advisory information, to display AMBER and Blue alerts, travel times, alternate routes, work zones, and safety campaign messages. There are six types of lines used to determine how a message is made.

Question to Answer: What happened?<br>Examples: COLLISION, HIGH WINDS, FLOODING, ACCIDENT

Question to Answer: Where?<br>Examples: EXIT 5, 18 MILES AHEAD, AT SOUTH BEACH RD

Question to Answer: What is closed/blocked?<br>Examples: 2 RT LANES CLSD, SINGLE LANE ONLY, FREEWAY CLOSED

Question to Answer: What is the effect on traffic?<br>Examples: TRAFFIC JAMMED, 20 MIN DELAY

Question to Answer: Who is the message for?<br>Examples: BOSTON TRAFFIC, 8-10 AM

Question to Answer: What is advised?<br>Examples: USE HWY 95, USE EXIT 4, PREPARE TO STOP

COLLISION, AT HOWE AVE, TRAFFIC JAMMED<br><br>FLOODING, 12 MILES AHEAD, USE EXIT 78<br><br>ACCIDENT, EXIT 14, TRAFFIC JAMMED<br><br>DRIVE HIGH, GET A DUI<br><br>CHILD ABDUCTION, RED KIA OPTIMA

Phase 1: COLLISION, EXIT 4, 20 MIN DELAY<br>Phase 2: SPRINGFIELD, TRAFFIC, USE HWY 12<br><br>Phase 1: FWY CLOSED, AT EXIT 24<br>Phase 2: TRAFFIC JAM, PREPARE TO STOP

There are two types of DMS: fixed (FDMS) and portable (PDMS). FDMS is a fixed sign attached to poles or Bridge that is often in use. A PDMS is a portable sign that is brought out only when needed, such as roadwork or natural disasters.

A new wave of LED display DMS are being used on Highway. With more than one color and increased pixel density, they are able to display images and messages with more clarity. Images and Symbol can help greatly to condense information for drivers on the road.

<<nodanger>>Like other electronics, a DMS can be Hacking, leading to messages that are not intended to be displayed on the device. These messages are usually only a single phase. Here are a few examples:<br><br>pee pee, poo poo, I farded<br><br>PEEPEE, POOPOO<br><br>STINKY, POOP, AHEAD<br><br>THE CAKE, IS A LIE<br><br>Phase 1: DONALD, TRUMP, IS A...<br>Phase 2: SHAPE, SHIFTING, LIZARD!!<br><br>TRAPPED, IN SIGN, FACTORY<br><br>DRIVE, DRUNK<br><br>STOP!!!<br><br>Collabor, ate &, listen<br><br>WARNING, DALEKS, AHEAD<br><br>WARNING!, DINOSAUR, ON LOOSE<br><br>ZOMBIE, ATTACK!!, EVACUATE<br><br>RAPTURE, AHEAD<br><br>ROUGE, PANDA ON, RAMPAGE<br><br>Phase 1: HONK, IF YOU, ARE<br>Phase 2: WEARING, A, THONG<br><br>SMOKE, WEED, ERRYDAY<br><br>YOU'LL NEVER, GET TO WORK, ON TIME, HAHA!!<br><br>DEDUND, THE, POLICE<br><br>SORRY MARIO, THE PRINCESS, IS IN ANOTHER, CASTLE<br><br>TRUMP, 2020<br><br>OMG THE, BRITISH, R COMING<br><br>DO YOU WANT, TO SPEAK TO A, MANAGER KAREN?</div>
