  <h1>Dynamic message sign</h1>
  <div><<shortElectronic changable road signshort>><<img(src=git/dms planted.jpg(cap=An FDMS attached to a [[metal]] [[pole]].img>>A {{bdynamic message sign}}, also known as a {{bvariable message sign}}, [[abbreviated|abbreviation]] as {{bDMS}} or {{bVMS}} respectively, is an [[electronic]] [[sign]] used as a [[warning]] for [[traffic]], routing information, safety information, and other important knowledge.<<hrPhaseshr>>A DMS has two phases, or [[frames|Frame]], that can be displayed at a time. The two phases will alternate, but not both phases are needed for a message to get across. Phases should only be used when needed. The time between each phase is determined by how long it takes to read a message and the speed of traffic, alongside sign visibility.&pThe message on each phase should be able to be understood separately. There is never a case to use three or more phases.<<hrMessageshr>>There are also guidelines for the messages to be displayed on a DMS. The main [[goal]] is for drivers to be able to quickly make a decision with the new information. Abbreviations should be used sparingly to avoid confusion. Attempt to prevent two abbreviations in a row, and never have three in a row.&pMessages are used as an early warning, for advisory information, to display AMBER and Blue alerts, travel times, alternate routes, work zones, and safety campaign messages. There are six types of lines used to determine how a message is made.<<hr2Problem/Descriptorhr2>>Question to Answer: What happened?&spExamples: COLLISION, HIGH WINDS, FLOODING, ACCIDENT<<hr2Locationhr2>>Question to Answer: Where?&spExamples: EXIT 5, 18 MILES AHEAD, AT SOUTH BEACH RD<<hr2Lane Closed/Blockedhr2>>Question to Answer: What is closed/blocked?&spExamples: 2 RT LANES CLSD, SINGLE LANE ONLY, FREEWAY CLOSED<<hr2Effecthr2>>Question to Answer: What is the effect on traffic?&spExamples: TRAFFIC JAMMED, 20 MIN DELAY<<hr2Audiencehr2>>Question to Answer: Who is the message for?&spExamples: BOSTON TRAFFIC, 8-10 AM<<hr2Actionhr2>>Question to Answer: What is advised?&spExamples: USE HWY 95, USE EXIT 4, PREPARE TO STOP<<hr2Single Phase Exampleshr2>>COLLISION, AT HOWE AVE, TRAFFIC JAMMED&pFLOODING, 12 MILES AHEAD, USE EXIT 78&pACCIDENT, EXIT 14, TRAFFIC JAMMED&pDRIVE HIGH, GET A DUI&pCHILD ABDUCTION, RED KIA OPTIMA<<hr2Double phase exampleshr2>>Phase 1: COLLISION, EXIT 4, 20 MIN DELAY&spPhase 2: SPRINGFIELD, TRAFFIC, USE HWY 12&pPhase 1: FWY CLOSED, AT EXIT 24&spPhase 2: TRAFFIC JAM, PREPARE TO STOP<<hrFixed and portable DMShr>><<img(src=git/dms portable.jpg(cap=A PDMS along the side of the road.img>>There are two types of DMS: fixed (FDMS) and portable (PDMS). FDMS is a fixed sign attached to poles or [[bridges|Bridge]] that is often in use. A PDMS is a portable sign that is brought out only when needed, such as roadwork or natural disasters.<<hrModern DMShr>><<img(src=git/modern dms.jpeg(cap=A modern DMS with an LED display, showing full-color imagery.(leftImgimg>>A new wave of [[LED]] display DMS are being used on [[highways|Highway]]. With more than one color and increased [[pixel density]], they are able to display images and messages with more clarity. Images and [[symbols|Symbol]] can help greatly to condense information for drivers on the road.<<safe<<hrHacked DMShr>><<nodanger>><<img(src=git/farded.png(cap=A hacked DMS showing a funny message.img>><<img(src=git/hack.jpg(cap=An old step-by-step [[guide]] to hacking a PDMS.(leftImgimg>>Like other [[electronics]], a DMS can be [[hacked|Hacking]], leading to messages that are not intended to be displayed on the device. These messages are usually only a single phase. Here are a few examples:&ppee pee, poo poo, I farded&pPEEPEE, POOPOO&pSTINKY, POOP, AHEAD&pTHE CAKE, IS A LIE&pPhase 1: DONALD, TRUMP, IS A...&spPhase 2: SHAPE, SHIFTING, LIZARD!!&pTRAPPED, IN SIGN, FACTORY&pDRIVE, DRUNK&pSTOP!!!&pCollabor, ate &, listen&pWARNING, DALEKS, AHEAD&pWARNING!, DINOSAUR, ON LOOSE&pZOMBIE, ATTACK!!, EVACUATE&pRAPTURE, AHEAD&pROUGE, PANDA ON, RAMPAGE&pPhase 1: HONK, IF YOU, ARE&spPhase 2: WEARING, A, THONG&pSMOKE, WEED, ERRYDAY&pYOU'LL NEVER, GET TO WORK, ON TIME, HAHA!!&pDEDUND, THE, POLICE&pSORRY MARIO, THE PRINCESS, IS IN ANOTHER, CASTLE&pTRUMP, 2020&pOMG THE, BRITISH, R COMING&pDO YOU WANT, TO SPEAK TO A, MANAGER KAREN?safe>></div>
