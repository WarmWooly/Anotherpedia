  <h1>Early bird catches the worm</h1>

This is because a [[bird]] is more likely to catch a [[worm]] if it looks for it before other birds. The idiom's first recorded use was in 1605 in a [[book]] by [[William Camden]]. The idiom is often shortened to {{bearly bird}}, being [[synonymous|synonym]] to an early riser.</div>
