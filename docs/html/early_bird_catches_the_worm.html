      <h1>Early bird catches the worm</h1>
      <div>Early bird catches the worm, or sometimes early bird gets the worm, is an idiom which states that those who are prepared to complete a task are more likely get a reward. This is because a bird is more likely to catch a worm if it looks for it before other birds. The idiom's first recorded use was in 1605 in a book by William Camden. The idiom is often shortened to early bird, being synonymous to an early riser.</div>
