  <h1>Economic history of Western Europe and Northern South America from 1500 to the present</h1>
  <div><<shortAspect of economic history in two regions from 1500short>>The {{beconomic history of Western Europe and Northern South America from 1500 to the present}} covers the [[history]] of the [[economics]] of [[Western Europe]] (primarily [[England]], [[Ireland]], and [[France]]) and [[Northern South America]] (primarily [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], and [[Brazil]]) from [[1500|1500 A.D.]] to the [[present]], including major events, how the economies changed with time, and comparisons between the economies in the regions. Western Europe underwent a transformative shift from feudal agrarian systems reliant on [[serfdom]] to a push for [[industrialization]], subsequently evolving into a modernized economy with a predominant focus on [[services|service economy]]. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Northern South America was subjected to [[colonial rule|Colonial rule of Latin America]], with agriculture and mining serving as its primary outputs until achieving independence in the early 19th century. Subsequently, the region underwent significant political and economic upheavals driven by [[warfare]], [[coups|coup]], and [[inflation|economic inflation]]. However, it has since followed modernization, marked by the expansion of its [[agricultural|agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[industrial|industry]] sectors into the 21st century.
    
    <<comment&pEconomics is a vital [[study]] in the world of history, fleshing out how both ancient and modern [[civilizations|civilization]] operate, what they believe in, how trade for [[resources|resource]] is handled, and how people are valued within their respective [[societies|society]]. Writing systems were developed to help keep track of [[ownership]] and [[debt]]. [[Communities|community]] and [[cities|city]] are built off of trade, and entire [[nations|nation]] have risen and fallen because of the forces of the economy. [[Wars|war]], [[revolutions|revolution]], [[migration]], and the search for a better life can all be driven by the [[desire]] for [[wealth]]. The desire for rare [[metals|metal]] and [[gemstones|gemstone]] drove the colonization of the [[Americas]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was defined by the decreased [[workforce]] required for making valuable [[products|product (business)]], and thousands of political conflicts were regarded to the managing of [[imports|import]], [[exports|export]], and debts. Furthermore, economic history sheds light on how patterns of trade, [[labor]], and [[production]] shape wealth and [[power|social power]] within societies. Rapid increases in growth may be caused by innovative policies, a sudden shift in improved [[education]] and [[healthcare]], the end of a [[blight]] or [[famine]], a rebuild after a [[natural disaster]], or a mixture of these factors, with the same true for [[downturn|economic downturn]] and [[depression|economic depression]]. The study of economics and its context throughout history can't be overstated, as it allows [[historians|historian]] to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the value of the [[world|Earth]] around us and [[humanity]] as a whole.comment>>

<<hrWestern Europehr>>
The economic history of Western Europe, particularly England, Ireland, and France, reveals an evolution defined by periods of modernization, transition, and challenges. Throughout the 16th century, England, Ireland, and France saw significant demographic shifts and economic developments. Ireland saw increased trade as it became a kingdom, England experienced a population boom, and France grappled with financial reform and severe inflation. Going into the 17th and 18th centuries, England's colonial ventures outpaced France's. Ireland was struggling under the dominance imposed by England as France continued to feel financial strain due to poor government spending and increasing inflation.&pThe Industrial Revolution led to a continued economic gain in England, being at the forefront of the revolution. Ireland was struck with the Great Famine and France was being shaken up by the French Revolution. As [[World War I]] and [[II|World War II]] brought upheaval to the entire region, England's industrial sector continued to strive forward. Ireland, now partitioned and pushing a policy of protectionism, faced stagnation during the wars. France endured significant setbacks from the wars, such as rapid inflation, [[Nazi]] occupation, and hindered food production.&pFollowing the wars, Western Europe saw a period of growth and recovery. Welfare and [[consumerism]] became prominent in England, Ireland, and France, as their participation in the [[European Economic Community]], and later, the [[European Union]], increased international trade. This was especially important for Ireland, allowing it to break free of having its main exporter the United Kingdom. The service industry started to dominate these nations, becoming the largest sector in all three countries. Challenges such as low GPDs and inflation persisted from the late 20th century into the early 2010s, most notably the [[Great Recession]]. Globalization was in full force by the 2020s, with England and France emerging as economic powerhouses. Meanwhile, Ireland utilized tax incentives to draw in corporations and to stimulate its economy.

<<hr216th centuryhr2>>
As the [[Middle Ages]] came to a close, the [[populations|population]] within the [[nations|nation]] exponentially grew. Ireland's separate economic communities would merge over the century as it became a kingdom, increasing trade with France and England. England's population boom pushed workers away from farmlands and toward the industrial sector, as sheep herding became a popular way to make income as wages stagnated. [[Deforestation]] in England led to the increased use of [[coal]], which would be fundamental for the [[Industrial Revolution]]. France, meanwhile, kept closer to its agricultural roots, despite [[inflation|economic inflation]] brought on by [[silver]] and [[gold]] harvested from the [[New World]], leading to [[monetary reforms|monetary reform]] at the end of the century.

<<hr3England's economic expansionhr3>><<img(src=git/1500 England Economy Chart.png(cap=A chart from 1500--1599 of the increase in [[price index]] and trade of agricultural and industrial goods as [[wages|wage]] decrease in England.<<ref(content=link|https://doi.org/10.1080/00708852.1978.10418952(text=refCountref>>img>>The population of England was increasing at a faster and faster pace throughout the 16th century, starting from 2.2 million in 1500 and nearly doubling to over 4 million in 1599, an 84% total increase.<<ref(content=link|https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-england-millennium(text=refCountref>> This boom was unable to be easily absorbed into [[farms|farm]] and fields as [[wages|wage]] steadily decreased. Land was also becoming more scarce, increasing [[rent]] for large plots, and making agriculture less profitable. The newly growing industrial sector absorbed more workers, allowing it to increase its growth rate compared to agriculture, especially when the average man's wage was lessening by the year. This population growth is considered to be the primary factor behind the economic rise of England.<<ref(content=link|https://doi.org/10.1080/00708852.1978.10418952(text=refCountref>>&pThere were additional factors at play, alongside the population boom, that advanced industry in England. An example can be drawn to [[coal]], which was an increasingly popular fuel. [[Deforestation]] had made [[wood]], especially [[firewood]], [[scarce]] and [[expensive]]. Coal, on the other hand, was becoming more abundant as [[mining practices|coal mining]] became more modern.<<note(content=From the 11th to 15th century, coal was originally found and harvested off the shores of England. When the shore supply of coal dwindled, settlers followed exposed seams inland and set up mines and shafts.(text=noteCountnote>> This would make coal a cheaper and widespread fuel, which would be vital for the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th century.<<ref(content=link|https://www.jstor.org/stable/24953925(text=refCountref>>&p[[Sheep]] and [[wool]] was a major industry during the 16th century. It wasn't solely a job by [[farmers|farmer]], but by [[lawyers|lawyer]], [[industrialists|industrialist]], and [[politicians|politician]] during the time. It became so expansive that there were even attempts to curb the popularity of sheep herding, such as an act in 1533 that made it [[illegal]] to have a flock above 2400 sheep (with exceptions)<<ref(content=link|https://vlex.co.uk/vid/tillage-act-1533-808479969(text=refCountref>> and a statute in 1555 that had farmers own a minimum number of [[cows|cow]] based on how much sheep they have. However, the consolidation of sheep ownership increased over the 16th century in England, with fewer and fewer people owning small collections of sheep. By the end of the century, the peasantry was much less likely to herd sheep, with medium-sized developers and lords taking the reins.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20230409104627/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-81676-7_1(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3Ireland and kingdomhoodhr3>>
Ireland had been slowly losing influence from England, with Ireland becoming nearly autonomous by the end of the 15th century. During the early 16th century, there were two "different" economies co-existing: a rural Gaelic economy based on [[milk products|milk product]], [[oats|oat]], [[wheat]], [[corn]], and [[animals|animal]] such as [[pigs|pig]] and [[sheep]], and a more interconnected English economy based on wheat and [[barley]] on larger fields alongside [[livestock]]. Gaelic communities were thin-spread between [[lordships|lordship]], with little to no [[coinage]] and limited exporting of goods. Meanwhile, the English communities were much more keen to export goods to France and England and import more luxurious items. 
As the population of Englishmen decreased in Ireland, Gaelic peasants took up jobs in the field, and in turn, Gaelic communities slowly adopted the English coinage.<<ref(content=link|https://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/economy-and-society-1500-1690(text=refCountref>>
&pIreland, when in trade, had an economy based on [[raw materials|raw material]], such as [[fish]] and [[animal skins|animal skins]]. However, as the century continued, there was a noticeable increase in exporting [[cloth]] and [[clothing]] while fish exports decreased. Imports to Ireland showed an increase in cloths and [[metals|metal]] with a decrease in [[foodstuffs]] over the forty years. It tends towards an increase in industrialization throughout the first half of the 16th century. Using [[records]] of [[merchant ships|merchant ships]] to and from [[Bristol]], a vital [[port city]] for trade with Ireland, a clearer picture of Ireland's economy during this time can be made.<<ref(content=link|https://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/History/Ireland/research.htm(text=refCountref>><<note(content=Values based on &pnd sterling.(text=noteCountnote>>&p<<table{{bExports}}|{{b{{c1503}}}}|{{b{{c1516}}}}|{{b{{c1541}}}}|{{b{{c1542}}}}|{{b{{c1545}}||Fish|{{r2466&sp71%}}|{{r2101&sp55%}}|{{r1346&sp31%}}|{{r708&sp26%}}|{{r954&sp33%}}||Skins|{{r447&sp13%}}|{{r797&sp21%}}|{{r476&sp11%}}|{{r521&sp19%}}|{{r595&sp21%}}||Cloth & clothing|{{r429&sp12%}}|{{r524&sp55%}}|{{r2432&sp56%}}|{{r1404&sp51%}}|{{r1210&sp42%}}||[[Misc|Miscellaneous]]|{{r149&sp4%}}|{{r343&sp9%}}|{{r94&sp2%}}|{{r110&sp4%}}|{{r113&sp4%}}||[[Illegible]]|{{r0&sp0%}}|{{r23&sp1%}}|{{r0&sp0%}}|{{r0&sp0%}}|{{r0&sp0%}}||{{bTOTAL}}|{{r3490}}|{{r3788}}|{{r4348}}|{{r2743}}|{{r2872}}table>>&sp

&spThe [[Kingdom of Ireland]] was established by the Parliament of Ireland and declared by King Henry VIII in 1542. This creation of a [[kingdom]] would sew the seeds of a more interconnected economy in England. During this period, the economy of Ireland was almost entirely exporting goods to England and nearby nations. It is believed that this reliance on England was made to force Ireland to remain subservient, with the political, commercial, and industrial interests of England overriding those of Ireland.<<ref(content=link|https://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/History/Ireland/research.htm(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3French exploration and downturnhr3>>France, during this time, was the most populous country in [[Europe]]. With a population of 16.4 million at the start of the century, growing to 20 million by the end, it was packed full of people.<<ref(content=link|http://markgreengrass.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Appendix-5.pdf(text=refCountref>> In a similar situation to England, land was becoming increasingly scarce. [[Feudalism]] was starting to wane in France as the middle class pushed against [[lords|lord]] and [[nobles|noble]].&pAgriculture was the dominant driving force behind France's economy at the time, producing [[melons|melon]], [[romaine lettuce]], [[artichokes|artichoke]], [[celery]], and other [[fruits|fruit]] and [[vegetables|vegetable]] alongside [[olive oil]], [[wine]], [[saffron]], and [[cider]]. [[King Francis I|Francis I]], rising to power in 1515 started sponsoring explorations to the [[New World]]. [[Crops|crop]] harvested and brought back to France, such as [[corn]], [[beans|bean]], [[tomatoes|tomato]], and [[potatoes|potato]], also were pushed into the economy. [[Colonies|French colonization of the Americas]] were also set up in the [[Americas]], such as in [[Canada]], modern-day [[United States]], and [[Brazil]]. [[Paris]], [[Rouen]], and [[Lyon]] became major [[cities|city]] filled with [[markets|market]] and trade. Imported goods included [[silk]], [[glass]], [[wool]], and [[dyes|dye]]. France traded with nations around it, such as England, [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[Netherlands]].&p[[Silver]] and [[gold]] quickly plummeted in value, being imported from [[Africa]] and the Americas, which in conjunction with an increasing population and a stagnation in wages, caused rapid [[inflation|economic inflation]] in France. [[Crop failures|crop failure]], [[epidemics|epidemic]], and the [[French Wars of Religion]] decreased the transport of goods. The [[scorched earth]] strategy adopted during the time caused crops and [[villages|village]] to be torched and razed, causing citizens to flee and reduce trade further. This downturn would start to improve in the last decade of the century as the [[weather]] improved and [[Henry IV|Henry IV of France]] passed [[monetary reforms|monetary reform]].

<<hr2Pre-Industrial Revolutionhr2>>This period from 1600 to the 1760s was a continued push away from agriculture and drew towards industrialization. England pushed colonialism across the Americas, with France's attempts underperforming compared to England's. New World crops became prominent staples of agriculture, such as [[corn]] and [[potatoes|potato]]. Ireland was stuck relying on England for trade, oppressed by high rents and poor crop yields. France's currency inflated over the period as Louis XIV plunged the nation into debt with massive projects.

<<hr3English colonialismhr3>><<img(src=git/17-18 century England.jpg(cap=Graphs representing the decline in agriculture and increase in industry from mid-16th to mid-18th century England.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420141/(text=refCountref>>img>>England after 1600 saw a shift out of agriculture, making it become more modest. From the 16th to 17th century, farming shares fell from 66% down to 43%, while the share of the workforce in industry rose from 22% to 31% and services grew from 12% to 26%. This shift started in the early 17th century leading directly to the Industrial Revolution.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420141/(text=refCountref>> Trade was also a prominent facet of the English economy, expanding their influence through the building of a robust trading network with [[merchants|merchant]], [[manufacturers|manufacture]], financers, and shippers.&pThe [[East India Company]] was formed by prominent merchants and explorers. In 1599, the group went to [[Queen Elizabeth I|Elizabeth I]] asking for &pnd30,133.<<ref(content=link|https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/east-indies-china-japan/vol2/pp99-102(text=refCountref>> This first attempt failed, but after a second attempt in 1600, the group succeeded in getting the royal investment.  Despite initial struggles to break even, the company managed to get a foothold in [[India]], expanding throughout the region to [[Asia]]. The purchase of [[slaves|slave]] from [[Madagascar]] in the late 17th century showed that the East India Company also profited from the [[slave trade]] at the time.<<ref(content=link|https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153&context=slisconnecting(text=refCountref>>&pEngland also started participating in the exploration of the New World, mainly in [[North America]]. The [[colonies in Virginia|Colony of Virginia]], notably [[Jamestown|Jamestown, Virginia]], started slow because of adversity shown by the native [[Algonquian Indians]] and a lack of [[food]]. The more [[aristocratic]] population of Jamestown who focused on valuable materials were unable or unwilling to farm, causing food shortages and requiring pillaging from Indian reserves.<<ref(content=link|https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amppsid=3574(text=refCountref>> [[Tobacco]] became a widely profitable [[cash crop]] of the colony as it grew. The most well-known colonial expansion was the [[Thirteen Colonies]], [[fishing]] and harvesting tobacco, [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[indigo]], and other crops to be sold to England. England thusly imported glass, [[linen]], [[machinery]], and household goods to the colonies and collected [[tax]], increasing the profits earned. This rapid expansion also led to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. These American colonies would later start [[breaking away|American Revolution]] in the 1960s, starting the [[American Revolutionary War]] during the Industrial Revolution.&pThis push for [[colonialism]] defined England's economy, using colonies that relied on England for supplies as they traded off resources produced in these colonies to make massive profits. Gold and silver were found in troves, as profitable crops such as [[sugarcane]], cotton, rice, and tobacco were sold by the boatload. This interconnected trade between England and the [[world|Earth]] would continue far into the Industrial Revolution, the next major shakeup in the English economy.

<<hr3Irish reliancehr3>>Ireland remained mostly unchanged between 1600 and 1760s, continuing to trade with England. Fishing, farming, and livestock management were still core pillars of Ireland's economy. However, trade restrictions from England made small towns flounder and left many estates across the lands.<<ref(content=link|https://www.britannica.com/place/Ireland/Social-economic-and-cultural-life-in-the-17th-and-18th-centuries(text=refCountref>> Farms adapted to the New World crops, notably potatoes as a primary source of food, as England purchased wheat and corn from farmers who used the income to make the increasing rent.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ighm.org/content/dam/ighm/documents/Student%20Newspaper%20Final.pdf(text=refCountref>> Ireland was reliant on trade with England, having little economic growth during the period as England extended their power over the nation. The [[Irish Famine of 1740--1741|Irish Famine (1740--1741)]], caused by terrible weather, was another major blow to Ireland, with up to 20% of the population of 2.4 million people being wiped out over the [[famine]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/dancing-on-ice-recalling-the-great-frost-of-1740/36663457.html(text=refCountref>> Overall, Ireland's economy stagnated as farmers could barely afford rent and food supplies kept dwindling.

<<hr3French taxation and spendinghr3>>The economic policies set by [[Henry IV]], including better [[coinage]], [[debt reduction]], and easing taxes on the [[peasantry]], continued under [[Louis XIII]]. When [[Louis XIV]] came to power, he pushed forth a [[military conquest]] and oversaw the building of the [[Palace of Versailles]], both requiring loads of [[money]]. New tax systems, including the "capitation" which taxed all people, regardless of status, and "dixième" which taxed based on [[property value]], were thusly put into place to allow increased governmental spending for these projects. These taxes, however, were rife with exceptions and had a history of spotty enforcement.<<ref(content=link|http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/MorrissonSnyder2000.pdf(text=refCountref>>&pThe [[French East India Company]] was created to compete with the English and the Dutch in the area, importing goods such as [[fur]], [[pepper]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]], and [[sugar]], despite being unsuccessful. Other colonies, such as their eastern American and Brazilian colonies, also didn't create large profits for France. Louis XIV would then issue the [[edict]] known as the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685. This edict revoked the previous 1958 [[Edict of Nantes]], leading to a mass [[expulsion]] of over 200,000 [[Huguenots]] (French [[Protestants|Protestantism]]). Many of these Huguenots, however, were highly skilled workers, who shut down their [[businesses|business]] and left for England, Ireland, [[Denmark]], and other countries.&pTaxes continued to fail to gain much income from [[churches|church]] and [[nobles|noble]], putting much of the burden onto the peasantry. International trade was severely limited because of the increased border protection brought on by the continuous wars. Bad harvests and [[starvation]] killed a tenth of the population at the end of the 17th century, as the value of metals and coinage continued to decrease. Drawing into the 18th century, [[paper currencies|paper currency]] were attempted multiple times, failing and eroding confidence in the French currency.<<ref(content=link|https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hyper.htm#LAW(text=refCountref>> However, after the death of Louis XIV, trade reopened, especially profiting off of new [[Caribbean]] colonies. Agriculture was still reliant on wheat, as potatoes and corn had limited availability regarding suitable land for the crops. If anything were to happen to the French's wheat availability, it would spell disaster. Overall, France was taking on severe debt as their currency kept inflating, having limited skilled labor and stuck relying on a few uniform foods going into the Industrial Revolution.

<<hr2Industrial Revolution to World War Ihr2>>This period from the 1760s to 1914 was defined by the rapid growth of the industrial sector in Western Europe. England, the origin of the [[Industrial Revolution]], profited significantly during this period. England's transition to [[capitalism]], the use of mechanical [[inventions|invention]] that reduced labor, and a growing [[working class]] defined the economy throughout the revolution. Ireland, united with England and stuck with a famine got much less out of the revolution, leading to little growth in Ireland's economy. France modernized over the 19th century following the [[French Revolution]], propelled by the propagation of railroads, new tax and land reforms, and increased investments in growing industry.

<<hr3England and the Industrial Revolutionhr3>>The Industrial Revolution was sparked by a mix of factors: the available [[canals|canal]], [[ports|port]], and [[roads|road]], excess [[manpower]] and food, a plentiful supply of [[coal]] and [[iron]], and a system that favored the creation of businesses. Substituting [[charcoal]] for [[coke|coke (fuel)]] greatly decreased the cost of producing [[iron]], with larger [[blast furnaces|blast furnace]] becoming available. [[Steam engines|steme engine]] and [[steam locomotives|steam locomotive]] at the turn of the 19th century, revolutionized [[transportation|rail transportation]]. [[Cotton-spinning machinery]] and the [[power loom]] created a whole new field of workers in [[factories|factory]] as more people left agriculture for industrial work. [[Machine tools|machine tool]], including the [[screw-cutting lathe]], the [[milling machine|milling (manufacturing)]], and the [[boring machine|boring (manufacturing)]], were developed, allowing for a more efficient manufacturing process. This was in addition to the new system of [[capitalism]], proposed by [[Adam Smith]], which quickly grew in favor of the old [[mercantilism]]. England was in the right place at the right time, making it become the [[{{ide facto}}]] trading nation.&pEngland had lost its largest colony in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775--1783), but the impact of losing it was not nearly felt as hard as expected. The empire realized that there was no major benefit to trading with nations that were [[sovereign]] compared to those that weren't. The [[Colonies|Colonial United States]] still was a major trade partner of England, despite the war. England would still partake in a 2nd wave of colonialism, known as [[imperialism]], using nations to harvest [[tropical crops|tropical crop]] to sell and trade. England's East India Company would push competition out of [[India]] during the 19th century, before dissolving in 1874. [[Asia]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]] were also major imperialized regions during the century.&pFrom 1780 to 1870, England was the leading nation, surpassing the [[Netherlands]] (the previous leading European country) by 20%, while flying by France and [[Germany]] by a staggering 70%. Agriculture was taking up a less significant share of the nation's labor, going from 45% in 1780 to half by 1870 (22.7%), before getting halved again by 1913 (11.8%). This growth is not attributed to investments in land or labor, but rather the improvements in [[technology]] and the increased [[efficiency]] in production. The [[urbanization]] of England compared to France and the increased [[free trade]], despite the smaller population, pushed England ahead in the Industrial Revolution.<<ref(content=link|https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.2.193(text=refCountref>><<note(content=GDP and GDP/Person based on $1990 [[international billion|international dollar]].(text=noteCountnote>>&p<<table|{{b{{c1780}}}}|{{b{{c1820}}}}|{{b{{c1870}}}}|{{b{{c1913}}}}||[[GDP|Gross domestic product]]|{{r15.2}}|{{r29.6}}|{{r95.6}}|{{r214.5}}||[[GDP/Person|Gross domestic product per capita]]|{{r1782}}|{{r2099}}|{{r3263}}|{{r5023}}||Agricultural Employment|{{r45%}}|{{r35%}}|{{r22.7%}}|{{r11.8%}}table>>&spDespite lagging behind the [[United States]] and Germany, England at the turn of the 20th century was still the global leader in trading, financing, and shipping, while also having large stakes in manufacturing and mining. The empowerment of the [[working class]] had come to a head, with a growing [[Labor Party]] gaining a hold in the [[Parliament|Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The low [[unemployment rates|unemployment rate]] gave [[unions|trade union]] [[bargaining power]] for [[higher wages|wage increase]] and increased [[job stability]]. This led to a marginal increase in wages and a [[national minimum wage]] for most laborious professions.

<<hr3Union, famine, and Irelandhr3>>Ireland had a brief boom from the 1760s to the 19th century caused by spillover from the Industrial Revolution.<<ref(content=link|https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/3854/98p035.pdf(text=refCountref>> The [[Kingdom of Ireland]] then underwent a union with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1801 to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During this period, Ireland would mainly produce [[raw materials|raw material]], such as [[timber]] and [[marble]] to the increasingly industrialized British economy. However, Ireland was still economically weak and dependent on England. Plots became smaller to the point where potatoes were the sole major crop to feed families. In the 1840s, when the [[Great Famine|Great Famine (Ireland)]] hit, devastating these potato fields, it left a massive scar on Ireland that can still be seen today. The widespread [[starvation]] and [[emigration|Emigration from Ireland during the Great Famine]] from Ireland prevented the building of a home market for industry as the population shrunk. Over a million died during the famine, with an additional 1.3 million emigrating throughout.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735970/(text=refCountref>> This famine stagnated industrialization in Ireland, keeping most of the economy focused on agriculture up until it split into [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

When [[Louis XVI]] came to power, the increasing debt forced him into permitting radical reforms, however, they did little to change the worsening situation. Despite supporting the American Revolution with money and supplies, they got little in return from the [[Treaty of Paris in 1783|Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. Significant price crashes of agricultural prices and terrible winters between 1785 and 1789 only added insult to injury, skyrocketing the price of wheat and [[bread]]. Taxes were once again raised to no avail.&pThe [[French Revolution]] brought on by the economic hardships and government corruption led to the abolishment of [[feudalism]] and the rule of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/french-revolution(text=refCountref>> The economy of France was highly unstable during this period, but it also laid the groundwork for modern economic practices, such as land reforms. Similarly to England, more farm jobs were transferred to the growing industrial sector, even if it was at a snail's pace compared to other European nations such as [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]].&pThe 1850s saw a major investment in [[railroads|railroad]], decreasing the cost of transport as France kept playing catch-up during the Industrial Revolution. France also lagged in [[coal|coal mining]] and [[iron mining]], but its agricultural sector held strong with improved [[livestock]] management, increased investments, and a railroad system, stabilizing food prices since the French Revolution. In the back half of the 1800s, economic downturn and depression struck again, exasperated by the still dominating agricultural industry and slow demographic growth. By the end of the century leading into the 1900s, healthy economic growth returned with investment in [[automobiles|automobile]] and [[electricity]].

<<hr2The World Warshr2>>The [[First World War|World War I]] started in 1914, kicking off a conflict that affected nearly every major economy. During the downtime between 1919 and 1938, unemployment and stagnation were common, with the Great Depression preventing much change. The [[Second World War|World War II]] (1939--1945) followed, again impacting all major economies across the globe. England saw a further increase in industrialization, influenced by the wars. Ireland's partition into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland led to continued stagnation in the Republic while Northern Ireland profited off the war. France was continually devastated by the damages in WWI, rapid inflation, the Great Depression, and Nazi occupation during WWII, effectively stopping all growth in the nation.

<<hr3English war productionhr3>>During WWI, economic production was drastically cut to create [[munitions|munition]] for the British forces. Throughout the war, England was spending &pnd4,000,000 on war efforts,<<ref(content=link|https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy(text=refCountref>> taking out [[loans|loan]] from the [[United States]] to help support the spending. The industrial sector, creating shells, aircraft, and other munitions and vehicles continued to grow during the period, supported by an increase in taxation<<ref(content=link|https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/taxation/overview/firstworldwar/(text=refCountref>><<note(content=The rate of income tax in England rose from 6% in 1914 to 30% in 1918.(text=noteCountnote>> and foreign loans. During the war, trade unions grew in size and women were also transferred from the [[home|housewife]] to the factory floor. Overall, England's economy remained stable throughout the war with the GDP growing throughout.<<ref(content=link|https://books.google.com/books?id=06KYLGALKNEC&amppg=PA370#v=onepage&q&f=false(text=refCountref>>&p{{i% GDP based on 1913}}<<table{{b{{c1913}}}}|{{b{{c1914}}}}|{{b{{c1915}}}}|{{b{{c1916}}}}|{{b{{c1917}}}}|{{b{{c1918}}}}||{{r100.0%}}|{{r101.0%}}|{{r109.1%}}|{{r111.5%}}|{{r112.5%}}|{{r113.7%}}table>>&spDespite an initial boom after the war, unemployment rose and the economy stagnated during the interwar period in England. The decade following WWI had little growth, followed by the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. The early 1930s were plagued by the Depression, shaking up the industrial industry that grew during the war. However, during this period, the consumer industry rebounded toward the end of the decade going into the Second World War. WWII saw England return to a shift of highly efficient government-backed industrial production of munitions. England was able to mobilize its [[home front]] during the war, optimizing industrial output. The economy would hold throughout the war, but it would yet again lead to a period of a weakened English economy afterward.

<<hr3Irish partitionhr3>>Ireland had little growth during WWI, with most involvement being in the recruitment of soldiers for the United Kingdom and not in the production of goods to support the effort. After the war, the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919--1921) had started. The War of Independence was relatively short, ending in a victory for Ireland, creating the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 out of 26 of the 32 [[counties in Ireland]] (later becoming the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1937). The remaining 6 counties closest to England would stay in the United Kingdom as [[Northern Ireland]]. The agriculture-based Ireland and economic isolation from Northern Ireland and England in the 1930s led to further stagnation. Northern Ireland, tied to England, kept a steady growth after the partition.&pWWII continued the disparity between Ireland and Northern Ireland, with Ireland taking a firm stance of [[neutrality|Irish neutrality during World War II]] and not profiting off the war. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland went from having a serious unemployment problem to a [[labor shortage]] at the start of the war. [[Belfast]], the capital of Northern Ireland, produced [[ships|ship]], [[tanks|tank]], and munitions, continuing to profit off of English trade throughout the war. This economic boom helped to alleviate the stagnation seen before the partition.

<<hr3French devastationhr3>>France, a major target of [[Germany]] during WWI, had suffered severely from the German occupation throughout the war. The loss of manpower and machinery inflated the price of food as agricultural production fell. English and American aid were vital for France during the war, as France was plunged into war damages and debt. Farmland and livestock were ruined and lost, railways, factories, and mines were destroyed, and 1.4 million soldiers were killed.<<ref(content=link|http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm(text=refCountref>> Inflation was the most prominent issue in France during the interwar period, fuelled by government borrowing and the increase in circulating money. Economic reforms and stabilization in the late 1920s would be in vain when the Great Depression hit France. Despite being milder compared to the effects of the Great Depression in the United States and England, it also lasted longer as France held onto its [[gold standard]] up until 1936.&pFrance in WWII was yet again a major target of [[Nazi Germany]], [[falling|Battle of France]] in June of 1940. The [[Vichy France]] was stripped of millions of workers and their food supply while Germany also demanded massive cash payments. The consistent lack of available food during the war caused by the German seizure of large portions of produced food, reduced farm production, and mismanagement of rations, led to the formation of a [[black market|Black market in wartime France]], further reducing the supply of commercial foods and devastating the economy.<<ref(content=link|https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20672479/(text=refCountref>> [[Forced labor]] was also present during this period, with nearly a million French [[POWs|prisoner of war]] used in forced labor by Nazi Germany. It would only be after the war and the reconstruction of France that its situation would improve.

<<hr2Post-World Warshr2>>After the Second World War, many countries in Western Europe started to bounce back with large post-war growth and deindustrialization. Low unemployment, increased welfare, and the spread of [[consumerism]] were prevalent in the 1950s and '60s after the war, especially in England and France. Mining and manufacturing became less prioritized by governments in the region as the service sector expanded. The European Union allowed for an influx of trade between countries, which especially aided Ireland's escape from its direct reliance on the UK for trade. Inflation and low GDPs appeared at the end of the 20th century to the early 2000s, with globalization and the spread of corporations across the world again pushing forth the service sector. England and France both became some of the wealthiest countries up to the present off of their expansive industry and exports as Ireland utilized tax exemptions to surge corporate interest and to stimulate its economy.

<<hr3Deindustrialization in Englandhr3>>England, unlike other Western European countries, was not as hard hit by the war. In the 1950s and 60s, England experienced post-war growth characterized by an improved [[quality of life|life quality]]. This period was considered a "golden age," with a low unemployment rate and increased [[welfare]] policies.<<ref(content=link|https://eh.net/book_reviews/an-affluent-society-britains-postwar-golden-age-revisited/(text=refCountref>> Cars and [[shopping centers|shopping center]] continued to lead the way to an increase in [[consumer spending]] as wages improved and [[benefits|employment benefit]] became more widespread. [[Appliances|household appliance]] such as [[washing machines|washing machine]], [[televisions|television]], [[vacuum cleaners|vacuum cleaner]], and [[fridges|refridgerator]] were becoming widespread in housing. However, unlike countries with previously agricultural-dominating economies, including France, [[Italy]], and [[Spain]], England didn't get a wave of further industrialization because it was already industrialized and even started to "deindustrialized" during the sixties and seventies.&pEngland had a reduced manufacturing output caused by deindustrialization in mining and manufacturing, going from an output of over 20% in the 1870s and 13.6% in 1913 to 4.9% in 1973.<<ref(content=link|https://www.google.com/books/edition/War_in_Human_Civilization/S6gSDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&amppg=PA519&ampprintsec=frontcover(text=refCountref>> Coal was becoming less valuable as [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] were used more in industry, leading to a decrease of nearly 100 million [[tonnes|metric ton]] of mined coal from 1900 to the 1970s.<<ref(content=link|https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption(text=refCountref>> Employment in steel decreased as railways and [[textile mills|textile mill]] closed down.

With a focus on [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]], industrial reforms, and tax changes, deindustrialization and unemployment continued to rise. In 1982, unemployment rose to over 12% with 3 million jobless.<<ref(content=link|http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm(text=refCountref>> This was followed by an additional increase of 9.3% only two years later,<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20110816212654/http://fullfact.org/factchecks/labour_attacks_the_tories_in_scotland-1444(text=refCountref>> contrasting the fluctuating inflation in the early 1980s. However, the economy started to recover with an [[economic boom]] in the latter half of the decade. Despite a [[recession|Early 1990s recession]] starting in the 1990s, the rest of the decade saw decreased unemployment and inflation.&pEngland's economy into the 21st century continued to be stable, with a slight increase in unemployment and a steady inflation rate up to 2007. The economy continued to shift away from manufacturing toward [[healthcare]] and [[finance]] during this period. The [[Great Recession]] hitting England in 2008 through 2009 led to massive unemployment and a GDP reduction of nearly 5% in 2009.<<ref(content=link|http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8594409.stm(text=refCountref>> This recession further saw a reduced priority on the manufacturing industry while inflation, employment, and wages lagged in the early 2010s. Despite disruptions caused by England's [[withdrawal|Brexit]] from the [[European Union]] and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], its economy is trending away from industry and manufacturing. Overall, England held strong during its current deindustrialization phase into the 2020s, holding the 6th highest GDP globally of 3.5 billion USD in early 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/top-10-largest-economies-in-the-world/86159/1(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3French reboundhr3>>France was one of the most devastated European countries because of the World Wars, but its rebound was spectacular, often known as {{i[[The Thirty Glorious Years|Trente Glorieuses]]}}. US debt had been forgiven, a [[welfare state]] had been established, and economic sectors were becoming nationalized, covering industries in steel production, electricity, gas, and banking. France continued to decrease trade restrictions and modernize industries as the US kept giving loans and funds to the nation. The [[baby boom]] following the war alongside improved housing and medical care greatly increased the size of the workforce. Agriculture boomed during the 1950s, with its decision to join the European Economic Community continuing to boost the economy.&pBy the end of the 1960s, {{iThe Thirty Glorious Years}} were coming to a close as [[civil unrest in 1968|May 68]] decreased trust for the French franc, with the [[1973 oil crisis]] grinding the economy to a halt. Taxes climbed as the cost of production swelled alongside the cost of energy caused by the oil inflation. A recession in the '80s, an economic depression in the '90s, stagnation in 2005, and the Great Recession in 2008 continued the trend of limited economic growth.

<<hrNorthern South Americahr>>The economic history of Northern South America is defined by large periods of change, connection, and innovation. The first three centuries are known for the colonization that dominated the lands. The Spanish Empire covered the areas of Colombia and Peru, while the Portuguese had a stake in their colonies in modern-day Brazil. These colonizers were the sole beneficiaries of this forced agreement, harvesting valuable metals and gemstones. Sugar and tobacco were vital cash crops used to keep these colonies profitable even after being stripped of non-renewable resources.&pIn the 19th century, a wave of independence over the region would take place, creating defined nations not constrained by a kingdom above. Mining and agriculture were still staple exports, but different nations relied on different niches. Colombia fell back on coffee and tobacco, Peru had seabird [[guano]], and Brazil took up coffee and [[natural rubber]]. Through the first half of the 20th century, industrialization became a major policy strived by those in the region. Despite setbacks in international trade caused by the global wars, the [[United States]] had directed trade between Northern South American countries, linking them irreversibly together in imports and exports.&pThe latter half of the 1900s to today is a continued push for economic independence from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, using decentralization as a goal to reduce this reliance. Colombia increased its economic and political stability, growing the private sector while pushing forth oil production. Colombia recently capitalized on a market of cut [[flowers|flower]], greatly contributing to its market of agriculture, mining, and industry. Peru, after undergoing multiple [[coups|coup]] and instability, started growing economically at the turn of the century. Peru also partakes in agriculture as their GDP soared. Brazil at the end of the 20th century saw major spikes in inflation caused by their reliance on the US and increasing debt from the government. Brazil is one of the more diverse nations in the region, not only hosting agriculture and mining but also an expansive industrial sector. The Northern South American region is currently predicted to continue growing throughout the 21st century.

<<hr2Colonizationhr2>>The New World was opened up by the Prior to colonization, the region was dominated by agriculture and [[bartering]] of goods such as [[clothing]], [[pottery]], and [[jewelry]]. There was Hunting natural wildlife was also a common practice during this time. The [[Inca]] in Peru even had a tax system where crops and labor, instead of coinage, would be exchanged to meet taxes. The New World was opened by the [[Spaniards|Spain]] and [[Portuguese|Portugal]] through their expeditions in the Americas, pursuing a conquest of land and resources for expansion, including Colombia, Peru, and Brazil in the early 16th century. Natives in Northern South America were culturally and ethnically stripped if not endangered through their colonization efforts.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20100327090558/http://www.eremite.demon.co.uk/Tairona/1pages/seca/a2tsatconq.html(text=refCountref>> It would be until the 19th century that independence would be won, allowing for an economy not solely made to benefit colonizers.

<<hr3Spanish colonization of Colombia and Peruhr3>><<img(src=git/spanish colonization of peru.jpg(cap=A [[drawing]] of [[Francisco Hernández Girón]], a Spanish {{iencomiendor}} in Peru, by [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]] in the 1530s.img>>Despite fierce resistance, Spaniards were able to colonize Colombia and Peru with the benefit of better food, healthcare, intellect, and especially [[firearms|firearm]], into successfully colonizing the lands.<<ref(content=link|https://www.peruinformation.org/colonial-period(text=refCountref>> As the Spaniards came to the New World with the goal of maximizing the profit of the newly discovered land, they prioritized the extraction of valuable materials, including [[gold]] and [[copper]]. The indigenous peoples were subject to [[forced labor]] and [[dehumanization]], with many [[killed|human killing of a human]] by the colonizers. Spain had monopolized all trade with the colonies, giving complete domination over Colombia and Peru. While the colonies exported valuable metals, they received imports from Spain including manufactured goods and [[African slaves|Slavery in Africa]].&pThe Spanish labor system known as {{i[[encomienda]]}} benefited [[conquistadors|conquistador]] with the labor of the colonized peoples. In return, the colonized peoples were supposed to benefit from [[education]] and [[protection|military protection]], however, that was rarely the case. Most, if not all, {{iencomiendors}} used their position to [[enslave|slavery]] those under their control. This encouraged the exploration of the New World between 1500 and 1540. In 1542, Spain passed the [[New Laws]] to try and prevent further abuses, such as requiring {{iencomiendors}} to free the Native Americans and that all land would return to the Crown on the death of the {{iencomiendor}}. There was plenty of resistance by those who benefited from forced labor, especially in Peru. The News Laws' enforcement was spotty at best, with attempts to free the slaves being little more than feckless gestures.<<ref(content=link|https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/americas/article/why-indigenous-slavery-continued-in-spanish-america-after-the-new-laws-of-1542/3189EAB5FBC018DBE89AE97B07AFC5D7(text=refCountref>> By the 17th and 18th centuries, the practice fell out of popularity due to the lack of formal support and improving standards for non-Christians under the Spanish empire.&pAgriculture throughout the 1500s was primarily to feed the workers and colonists, especially because the relatively few ships limited exports to high-value low-volume goods. As trade and [[seafaring]] became more prominent toward the 1600s, food also became an export from the colonies. [[Sugar]] and [[tobacco]] were popular crops to produce and food became a pillar of Colombia's economy in the 1700s. This growth in agriculture over two centuries was due to the decline in available nonrenewable resources with the mining equipment at the time. African slaves became prominent replacements for the locals in the 17th century, especially in mining. When agriculture became more profitable, slaves were transferred to the fields, despite the increasing cost. The purchase of slaves fell out of favor in the 18th century, but it would only be in the 19th century with the independence of Colombia and Peru that slavery would be abolished.

<<hr3Portuguese colonization of Brazilhr3>>Portugal, searching for a source of goods for the European market, competed with Spain in the Americas after the discovery of the New World. Portugal attempted to adopt a similar strategy in Brazil to what the Spaniards did in Colombia and Peru: extract rare metals from the earth. To their dismay, gold wouldn't be found until the 18th century. The trade of {{i[[pau-brasil|Paubrasilia]]}} (also known as brazilwood), a red [[wood]] popular for its [[dyeing|dye]] capabilities, initially kept the economy of the infant colony afloat.<<ref(content=link|https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/centralandsouthamerica/brazil/riodejaneiro/fdrs_feat_129_9.html?pagewanted=1(text=refCountref>>&pAs [[deforestation]] required labor to head inland, it became increasingly ideal to rely on agriculture near the [[coastline]]. "Traditional" agriculture of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] would be unprofitable because of the added expense of shipping a crop that was already produced in Europe. Sugar became the ideal crop to harvest, especially because [[mills|sugar mill]] and [[plantations|sugar plantation]] had already been put into place by the early colonizers.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20200926175933/http://www.ibrac.net/index.php/o-ibrac/historico(text=refCountref>> Commonly known as the [[Brazilian sugar cycle]], this cultivation and processing of [[sugarcane]] became the economic backbone of the colonies. The African slave trade aided in obtaining the necessary laborers required to keep up with the expanding boom in sugar production in the colony. Portugal's alliance with the [[Dutch|Holland]] allowed them to [[monopolize|monopoly]] the sale of sugar, with Portugal facilitating the production and the Dutch the trade.&pAfter being put under the rule of Spain in 1581,<<ref(content=link|https://unacademy.com/content/upsc/study-material/general-awareness/a-short-history-of-spain-and-portugal/(text=refCountref>> Portugal was roped into the [[Eighty Years' War]] against its formerly allianced Holland, in which they occupied Brazil in the mid-17th century. Even after being driven out in 1654, the Dutch had gained the knowledge of how to produce their own sugar and created colonies in the [[Caribbean]], undermining colonial Brazil's former monopoly. [[Cattle ranching]] was vital to keeping the colony from collapsing as sugar dove in price, causing Brazil to be unable to participate in the market as all its resources were used to sustain itself. Coffee was also being grown in Brazil, but it remained a domestic product until the 19th century. Rolling into the 18th century, the colony was blessed with the discovery of large [[veins|ore vein]] of gold and other precious [[gemstones|gemstone]], allowing the colony to stay economically viable for Portugal to the next century.

<<hr2Independencehr2>>In the 19th century, many nations within the colonized Americas increased fighting for independence from their colonial rulers, such as Colombia and Peru under Spain and Brazil under Portugal. These nations would all gain full independence in the 1820s, when they each attempted to develop their economies during the turbulent and politically unstable years. Colombia would continue to rely on outdated labor practices, mining, and agriculture to support itself. Peru relied on the nationalized monopolization of seabird guano to power through the mid-19th century, before going bankrupt by a railroad endeavor and conflicts with connected nations, before starting to rebuild. Brazil's population boomed as they increased infrastructure and trade by the value of rubber and coffee exports.

<<hr3Colombian independencehr3>>Colombians had been resisting Spanish rule throughout the past three centuries, but it would only be in the 19th century that the locals would be able to successfully push back and regain their lands. The [[Colombian War of Independence]] started after Colombia issued its Declaration of Independence on July 20, 1810, where they would continue to fight against the Spaniards until 1825. After the war, the economy of Colombia continued to rely on mining and agriculture, where there were a privileged few in the new nation. [[Coffee|coffee bean]] and [[tobacco]] became popular exports of Colombia by the end of the 19th century. Compared to other nearby nations, Colombia was lagging behind, continuing labor practices that kept the lower class down while continuing to support a small class of land-owning elites<<ref(content=link|https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2015/nr-4/colombias-bloody-history/(text=refCountref>> before modernizing in the early 20th century.

<<hr3Peruvian independencehr3>>Peru, like Colombia, rebelled against Spain throughout their reign over the nation. In 1809, the [[Peruvian War of Independence]] was kicked off by rebellions between northern and southern Peru caused by discrimination created by the mining industry. The Declaration of Independence of Peru would be signed on July 15, 1821, with the war concluding five years later. Political instability, corruption, and civil infighting would continue after Peru's independence until 1845. Afterward, Peru went through a period of political and economic stability with the rise of [[Ramón Castilla]].&pPeru's large coastline allowed for the natural accumulation of [[guano]] from [[seabirds|seabird]] within the region. Guano was discovered in Peru and put under the European spotlight at the turn of the 19th century, where it was investigated as being a potential [[fertilizer]]. Compared to guano generated in Europe, Peru's was of a much higher quality due to the favorable [[climate|Climate of Peru]]. In the 1840s, the government of Peru took advantage of its [[monopoly]] on guano, exporting it to Europe and North America as a fertilizer.<<ref(content=link|https://www.academia.edu/1788506/Influence_of_Seabird_guano_and_Camelid_dung_fertilization_on_the_nitrogen_isotopic_composition_of_field_grown_maize_Zea_mays_(text=refCountref>> As it was a nationalized market, it allowed for the paying off of [[debts|national debt]] and increasing [[education]] in the nation up to the 1860s. By then, many of the guano reserves had become depleted, with others dwindling, causing miners to turn to [[islands|island]] off the coasts of [[Africa]] for new guano exports. Wars with Spain and [[Ecuador]] had put Peru back into debt.&pThe [[American|Americans]] [[Henry Meiggs]], an entrepreneur from [[Boston]], was fleeing from [[San Francisco]] after committing [[forgery]] and [[fraud]] before his wrongdoings were discovered. After landing in [[Chile]], he made a fortune constructing railroads in the nation. He then turned toward Peru, which was susceptible to Meiggs' proposition of creating their own railroad network.<<ref(content=link|http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/meiggs.html(text=refCountref>> He quickly grew in influence over Peru, being considered a virtual [[dictator]] over the nation.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20040606044839/http://www.jacobsarts.com/KieferBoytonPeru/Peru/grace.htm(text=refCountref>> However, the expense of the massive railroads had fully [[bankrupted|bankrupt]] Peru, creating an economic crisis in the nation. In 1879, Peru was then roped into the [[War of the Pacific]] with its ally [[Bolivia]] against Chile, in which Peru and Bolivia lost. This loss would actually contribute to a push to rebuild Peru, with social and economic changes created to aid the economy. This would lead to economic stability as seen in the 1840s going into the 1900s.

<<hr3Brazilian independencehr3>>The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused the government of Portugal to flee to Brazil, greatly increasing the influence Brazil had over its colonizers. Trade was opened up with England with a favorably low [[{{iad valorem}} tax]] on British imports and an increase in manufacturing in 1810, with the drawback of losing their sugar and tobacco exports until 1844 to allow British dominance in the sugar and tobacco industry. This economic empowerment for Brazil helped lead to Brazil's independence in 1822. After independence, the population in Brazil dramatically grew throughout the rest of the century, with the GDP barely keeping pace with the new nation.&pCoffee continued to be the main export of Brazil, expanding throughout the 19th century. By the 1850s, it became the largest export of Brazil, especially benefiting from the autonomy granted by no longer being under colonial rule. The main constraints to the growth of coffee in Brazil were the transportation and the labor required for harvesting the crop. Railroads were started to be built in the 1860s to support the transportation needs created by the increased distance between coffee fields and the ports, while [[immigrant labor]] supplemented slavery while it was being abolished in the 1880s. This improved infrastructure allowed exports of [[cotton]], [[cocoa|cocoa bean]], and tobacco. The infrastructure continued to improve because of a boom in [[rubber]] demands, further boosting the Brazilian economy.

<<hr21900s through the World Warshr2>>The span between 1900 and 1945 saw increased industrialization and globalization throughout the Northern South American region. The United States capitalized on the reliance on exports from these nations to grow a closer bond to their southern neighbors. Colombia saw the expansion of transportation and communication infrastructure while being provided with machinery and aid from the US. Peru stuck closer to agriculture, also being nudged by the US for exports. Brazil's financial policy mirrored those of other fascist nations, pushing forth industrialization and corporatism while crushing the working class.

<<hr3Colombia and the UShr3>>Going into the 1900s, Colombia saw an increase in modernization as coffee exports increased in the country. Railroads and improved communications were set up, following Brazil's tactic of expansion when booming with coffee, to ride on the success. This boom also expanded the wealth of the working class, as after the [[Thousand Days' War]], large plantation owners had to partition their plantations among their workers, who made massive profits as coffee continued to soar.<<ref(content=link|https://www.nescafe.com/in/colombian-coffee(text=refCountref>>&pColombia remained neutral during WWI, facing little to no effect from the global conflict, but was given more attention by the [[United States]].<<ref(content=link|https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA586356756&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=15572021&ampp=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=mlin_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true&aty=geo(text=refCountref>> Colombia had also weathered the [[Great Depression]], shifting away from the collapsing coffee industry to exporting [[raw materials|raw material]]. Colombia took a more active role in WWII, allowing the US to station troops within the nation while aiding in naval operations. As European and Asian markets cut out Colombia, they increasingly relied on US trade for machinery and steel. The US also grew interest in the [[platinum]] mining operations in Colombia, a metal the [[Axis powers]] were in low supply of during the war, causing the US to buy up their entire supply while providing technical aid to increase production from Colombia to be exported to the US. The US had also been vital in keeping Colombia's [[banana]] and coffee industries afloat during the war.

<<hr3Coup in Peruhr3>>Peru entering the 20th century saw continued economic growth with their exports of [[cotton]], sugar, and metals from mining from their rebuilding. However, WWI's disruption of the global market had harmed the economy of Peru, which almost exclusively relied on foreign exports beforehand. Following, former President [[Augusto Leguía|Augusto B. Leguía]] staged a [[coup]], succeeding, which led to changes being made to economic policy in the early 1920s. The government under Leguía had continued to accrue national debt, boiling over in the early 1930s after Leguía was overthrown, leading to Peru being ostracized from foreign markets.<<ref(content=link|https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/pe/pe_full.html(text=refCountref>> During the Second World War, the US also started receiving exports from Peru, mainly in cotton. Peru's policy on price controls backfired on Peru as they received less economic benefits from the war compared to their neighbors.

<<hr3Industrialization, fascism, and Brazilhr3>>Brazil's export economy's strength persisted to WWI, despite their active involvement against the [[Germans|Germany]] and the [[Central Powers|Central Powers in World War I]]. Their involvement in the war allowed Brazil to profit from the increased demand for [[foodstuffs]] and raw materials. This would be the first indication of Brazil's trend away from an agricultural economy and towards an industrial one. The Great Depression in 1928 hit hard on Brazil, cutting their coffee exports in half and nearly killing all foreign investments in the country.&pBrazil, shortly after the Depression, would see the rise of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]], as the government pushed increasingly [[communist]] and [[fascist]] influences into their economic policy. These new policies focused on increasing the power of [[corporations|corporation]] in the name of an improved industrial sector while also trying to weaken the [[working class]]. Investment had increased again, rebounding from the crash during the Depression. Brazil surprisingly sided with the [[Allies|Allies of World War II]] during WWII, contrary to the [[Axis|Axis powers]]-inspired fascist regime in the nation at the time. The US gave financial incentives to Brazil early in the war, tying it close to the US throughout. During the war, the GDP in Brazil drastically grew alongside the industrial sector.<<ref(content=link|https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-6/economic-crisis/(text=refCountref>>

<<hr2Post-World Warshr2>>After the World Wars, countries in Northern South America primarily focused on decreasing their reliance on foreign nations for imports. Inflation was a reoccurring problem for some, as these nations were still developing their economy after the wars. Reforms were common during this period as nations attempted to find the right balance of government control and decentralization to allow their markets to soar. Going into the 21st century, this region held onto its economic roots, relying on the favorable climate to grow crops native to the region alongside others that also thrive in the unique conditions. Mining has also been an industry continuously carved out as mining equipment and practices modernized, increasing their ability to extract resources including gold, iron, and coal. This region also experienced large economic growth as they became more interconnected with the wider, world, including Peru's GDP increasing fivefold and Brazil having the 10th largest GDP in the world.

<<hr3Colombia's stabilityhr3>>Following the wars, Colombia focused on increasing their domestic sector, replacing imports with their own produced goods. Coffee production continued to soar in Colombia as more land was allocated for production while policies on [[banks|bank]] were set into place to curb inflation. The economy kept stable throughout the 1980s, with no major spikes in growth or dips into recessions. In the 1990s, decentralization became a goal of the new administration, removing government interference and increasing free trade. The [[private sector]] grew as [[oil production]] became a staple of the Colombian economy, further connecting Colombia to the foreign market.&pLeading into the 21st century, Colombia had a new [[flower]] market emerge, quickly growing to become a major contributor to Colombia's market. Colombia has since become the 2nd largest producer of cut flowers in 2021.<<ref(content=link|https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2021/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/060310(text=refCountref>> Throughout the century, Colombia sustained a calm rate of growth from its agricultural sector. Coffee remains one of its largest agricultural exports, with sugarcane and cocoa closely behind. The industrial sector also continued to expand, following its post-war domestication of products. Colombia continues its mining production for [[oil]], [[coal]],  [[emeralds|emeralds]], and other valuable minerals. Today, Colombia's economy is set to be stable through its agriculture, industrial, and mining sectors that dominate the nation.<<ref(content=link|https://www.moon.com/travel/trip-ideas/colombias-economy/(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3Peru's reboundhr3>>Peru faced another military coup after the war from General [[Manuel A. Odría]], who took power in 1948. His dictatorship directly influenced the economic policy, exploiting the remaining wealth following the wars. New policies were focused on coastal nations, growing the economy at the cost of impoverishment of those in the interior of Peru.<<ref(content=link|https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/pe/pe_full.html(text=refCountref>> After the fall of Odría, [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] took power through a following [[coup|1968 Peruvian coup d'état]], establishing [[state capitalism]] amidst a period of economic growth. Land reform under Velasco replaced the former [[serfdom]]-derived system for one of the [[agricultural cooperatives|agricultural cooperative]]. Coups, conflicts, and internal struggles continued to shake and stagnate the Peruvian economy for the next three decades.&pIt is only leading through to the 21st century when Peru starts to regain economic growth. It saw a similar policy change to Colombia toward decentralization of businesses and industries, decreasing governmental interference. This shift encouraged foreign investment as more effort was pushed toward privatization. Agriculture remains strong in Peru, producing [[avocados|avocado]], [[blueberries|blueberry]], [[cocoa]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[bananas|banana]], and other [[tropical crops|Crops in Latin America]]. Peru also has a large stake in mining, where [[gold]], [[silver]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[coal]] are harvested. Between 2000 and 2022, the GDP of Peru increased nearly fivefold,<<ref(content=link|https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/April/weo-report?c=293,&s=NGDPD,&sy=2000&ey=2022&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1(text=refCountref>> representing the trend of expansion and accrual of wealth present in the nation today.

<<hr3Brazil's inflation and comebackhr3>><<img(src=git/brazil inflation 1950.jpg(cap=The rate of inflation within Brazil from 1950 to 1995.<<ref(content=link|https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-6/economic-crisis/(text=refCountref>>img>>Brazil followed the trend of other countries in the region, decreasing their reliance foreign imports and turning to nationalized industry to support themselves. Long-lasting goods, such as [[trucks|truck]], became more prominent during this period as consumerism rose during the period. Following stagnation in the mid-1960s, Brazil saw a boom in economic growth. Exports grew from 31% between 1960 and 1962 up to 42.7% in 1972, showing an upward trend during this time.<<ref(content=link|https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.brazilcountrystu00huds_0/?sp=272&st=image(text=refCountref>> Modernization became prominent during this growth, boosting the economy as Brazil continued to diversify its industry.&pAfter the period of prosperity, the economy's growth started to slow, turning around into a deficit and [[inflation|economic inflation]]. The dips and instability in the price of oil aided in the downturn and inflation faced by Brazil. Brazil's close ties to the US would backfire when banks in 1981 cut their credit lines to Brazil causing Brazil to slip into [[hyperinflation]].<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20170805061126/http://brazil.melhores.com.br/chapter2.html(text=refCountref>> It would take government action in the second half of the 1980s to control inflation, most notably with the [[Cruzado Plan]] in 1986. A following hyperinflation spike would occur in the early 1990s.&pBrazil in the 21st century saw a rise in its economy as it became more modernized within the 2000s. Their agricultural sector is still quite predominant, covering sugarcane, coffee, [[soy|soybean]], and [[oranges|orange (fruit)]] as their staple crops. Brazil's mining stake covers gold, iron, copper, [[aluminum]], and other various gemstones and metals. Brazil also boasts a diverse industrial sector, covering [[aircraft]], [[automobiles|automobile]], [[computers|computer]], and [[steel]] products. Brazil has the 10th highest GDP of 2 billion USD in early 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/top-10-largest-economies-in-the-world/86159/1(text=refCountref>>

<<hrComparisonshr>>Despite their geographic distance and historical background, Western Europe and Northern South America share parallels in the evolution of their economies. Both regions had heavy influence through colonialism, with one bolstering their economy through the practice, and the other subjected and pressed through the practice. They had also experienced industrial growth, with Western Europe being the starting location for the Industrial Revolution as Northern South America adopted it to push forth their agricultural industry. The World Wars had an imbalanced impact on the regions, with Northern South America benefiting from their trade with the US while Western Europe was at the forefront of the wars. To the [[present]], Northern South America's economy is still undergoing development as they continue to industrialize and rely on their [[natural resources|natural resource]] while Western Europe continues to stay ahead in economic development as they both participate in the global economy.

<<hr2Colonialismhr2>>Western European colonies were bolstered through colonialism, pushing through the New World to benefit from the newly discovered crops, rare metals, and unique climates that aided in agriculture. England was a major proponent of colonialism, launching the East India Company and colonizing North America, which profited from tobacco, rice, and cotton from their colonies. France also attempted to join in on colonialism, with less success through their French East India Company and their involvement within North America and Brazil. From the 1500s and three centuries thereafter, Northern South America was defined by colonialism, not as a source of income, but as a tool of [[oppression]]. The primary benefactors of exports from the region were the colonizers and not the inhabitants. They also produced rare metals and gemstones, crops including sugarcane and tobacco, and {{ipau-brasil}}. Northern South America, unlike Western Europe, did not experience the same economic advantages, instead being shaped through exploitation and subjugation.

<<hr2Industrializationhr2>>Both regions experienced industrial booms, albeit at different times. Western Europe was the [[first]] to experience industrialization, especially England, the birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 1760s. France, despite lagging behind because of the [[French Revolution]], would also see industrialization in the 1850s. [[Railroads|railroad]] would become prominent during this industrial period as factory jobs would span across Western Europe. Northern South America would continue to stick closely to their agricultural exports in the 19th century and halfway through the 20th. Brazil and Peru both attempted to utilize railroads to expand the size of their agricultural empires in their respective nations. While Peru's attempt ended in bankruptcy for the nation, Brazil's railroad system bolstered the economy while cotton, cocoa, tobacco, rubber, and especially coffee exports skyrocketed. While Western Europe saw a period of deindustrialization after the World Wars, instead focusing on the modern service sectors to expand their economies into the [[Information Age]], Northern South America saw industrialization grow as their political and economic situations stabilized.

<<hr2World Warshr2>>While the World Wars had directly impacted Western Europe's economy (with the primary [[theaters|theater (warfare)]] taking place in the region), Northern South America saw less drastic effects. England's economy had a stable, yet slow growth throughout the wars, taking out loans from the United States to create [[munitions|muntion]] for the war effort, while France (a major target of [[Germany]] in both wars) was directly devastated with infrastructure destroyed and millions of people lost. Colombia, Peru, and Brazil would all create closer bonds with the US throughout WWII, with Colombia and Brazil continuing to see economic growth through the period.

<<hr2Modern economieshr2>>In the modern economy, Western Europe and Northern South America have undergone globalization as their economies, imports and exports, are influenced by all the nations in the world. [[International trade]], [[foreign investments|foreign investment]], and the [[global supply chain]] all have a direct impact on these regions. They also are influenced by the diversification of their economies, increasing economic security and expanding their economies overall. While Western Europe primarily focuses on growing its service sector, Northern South America varies its agriculture, industrial production, and [[tourism]] to diversify. While the economy and infrastructure in Western Europe are highly advanced with the benefit of earlier industrialization and increased wealth, Northern South America is still catching up. Brazil is the most successful in the region to do so, having the 10th highest [[GDP|global domestic product]] in early 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/top-10-largest-economies-in-the-world/86159/1(text=refCountref>></div>
