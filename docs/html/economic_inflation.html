      <h1>Economic inflation</h1>
      <div>Economic inflation or inflation is the increase, or inflation, of prices for goods and services in an economy, resulting in a reduced purchasing power of a currency. Inflation can be caused by the increase in the supply of money, a scarcity of a good or resource, loaning new money, or purposefully devaluing the currency. Inflation is measured by the annual or monthly percentage of change, such as a 2% increase (where something costing $1.00 would now be $1.02). When inflation is extremely high (usually 50% increase in a month), it is known as hyperinflation. When the value of a currency increases, it is known as deflation.</div>
