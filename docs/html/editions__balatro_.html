      <h1>Editions (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Editions are Modifiers that can be added to playing cards and Jokers in Balatro. Only one Edition can be on a card at a time. If a new Edition is added to a card that already has one, the previous Edition will be overwritten. Purchasing cards and Jokers from the Store or from booster packs are ways to get cards and Jokers with Editions, but they may also come from Spectral Cards or the Tarot Card The Wheel of Fortune. There are a total of 5 different Editions, but only 4 have unique effects.<<tableName|Effect||Base|Has no effect. Default edition of all cards.||Foil|Adds 30 chips when scored (for playing cards) or activated.||Holographic|Adds 10 mult when scored (for playing cards) or activated.||Polychrome|Multiplies the mult by 1.5 when scored (for playing cards) or activated.||Negative|Adds 1 Joker slot (the card still takes a slot).table>></div>
