      <h1>Editions (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Editions are Modifiers (Balatro) that can be added to playing cards (Balatro) and Jokers (Balatro) in Balatro. Only one Edition can be on a card at a time. If a new Edition is added to a card that already has one, the previous Edition will be overwritten. Purchasing cards and Jokers from The Store (Balatro) or from booster packs (Balatro) are ways to get cards and Jokers with Editions, but they may also come from Specral Cards (Balatro) or the Tarot Cards (Balatro) The Wheel of Fortune (Balatro). There are a total of 5 different Editions, but only 4 have unique effects.<<tableName|Effect||Base|Has no effect.
