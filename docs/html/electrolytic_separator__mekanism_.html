      <h1>Electrolytic Separator (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>The electrolytic separator is a block in the Minecraft mod Mekanism used to electrolyze liquids to other chemicals.
The electrolytic separator can be crafted with 4 iron ingots, 2 redstone, 2 enriched alloy, and 1 electrolytic core (the iron ingots are in the corners, with the redstone on the top and bottom and the energetic alloys on the sides, where the middle slot is filled with the electrolytic core).
The electrolytic separator, which runs on 400 J/t, currently has three reactions it can perform:&sp2 mB Water --> 2 mB Hydrogen + 1 mB Oxygen&sp2 mB Heavy Water --> 2 mB Deuterium + 1 mB Oxygen&sp10 mB Brine --> 1 mB Sodium + 1 mB Chlorine</div>
