      <h1>Elf on the Shelf (meme)</h1>
      <div>The meme about the Elf on the Shelf is how the words rhyme, such as elf and shelf. The format of the meme consists of a character or object on another object, such as an elf that is on a shelf. Many open the meme with now get ready for as if the meme is a step up from the elf on the shelf. They often don't explain what the character or object is, requiring the viewer to guess based on their prior knowledge, acting as a puzzle. Occasionally, when there is a container the object is in the, and not on the, container.

There are a wide variety of examples of the meme, including:&spDuck on a truck&spDrake on a cake&spSnape on a grape&spLEGO on an Eggo&spTide on a slide&spSanta on a Fanta&spWoody in a hoodie&spYoda on a soda&spChrome on a gnome&spWookie on a cookie&spLuigi on a Fiji&spVader on a tater&spRuPaul on a U-Haul&spSkeleton on gelatin&spLink on a sink&spBart in a cart&spShaggy on a baggie&spVegeta on a cheetah&spDratini in a martini

Main page: Dratini in a martini&spThe most prolific variation on the Elf on the Shelf meme has been the Pokémon Dratini in a martini, garnering artworks, pins, stickers, sculptures, tattoos, and various other creative works.
