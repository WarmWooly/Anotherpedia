      <div><<shortMeme related to rhyming wordsshort>><<img(src=git/elf on the shelf meme.jpg(cap=A [[Shrek|Shrek (character)]] on a [[deck]].img>>The {{b[[meme|internet meme]] about the [[Elf on the Shelf]]}} is how the [[words|word]] [[rhyme]], such as {{ielf}} and {{ishelf}}. The format of the meme consists of a [[character]] or [[object]] on another object, such as an [[elf]] that is on a [[shelf]]. Many open the meme with {{inow get ready for}} as if the meme is a step up from the elf on the shelf. They often don't explain what the character or object is, requiring the viewer to guess based on their prior knowledge, acting as a [[puzzle]]. Occasionally, when there is a [[container]] the object is {{bin the}}, and not {{bon the}}, container.<<hrVariationshr>><<img(src=git/link in a sink.jpeg(cap=A [[Link|Link (The Legend of Zelda)]] in a [[sink]].img>><<img(src=git/vegeta on a cheetah.jpeg(cap=A [[Vegeta|Vegeta (Dragon Ball)]] on a [[cheetah]].img>>There are a wide variety of examples of the meme, including:&sp[[Duck]] on a [[truck]]&sp[[Drake|Aubrey Graham]] on a [[cake]]&sp[[Snape|Severus Snape (Harry Potter)]] on a [[grape]]&sp[[LEGO]] on an [[Eggo]]&sp[[Tide|Tide Pods]] on a [[slide]]&sp[[Santa|Santa Claus]] on a [[Fanta]]&sp[[Woody|Woody (Toy Story)]] in a [[hoodie]]&sp[[Yoda|Yoda (Star Wars)]] on a [[soda]]&sp[[Chrome|Chrome (browser)]] on a [[gnome]]&sp[[Wookie|Wookie (Star Wars)]] on a [[cookie]]&sp[[Luigi]] on a [[Fiji]]&sp[[Vader|Darth Vader (Star Wars)]] on a [[tater|tater tot]]&sp[[RuPaul|RuPaul Charles]] on a [[U-Haul]]&sp[[Skeleton]] on [[gelatin]]&sp[[Link|Link (The Legend of Zelda)]] on a [[sink]]&sp[[Bart|Bart Simpson (Simpsons)]] in a [[cart]]&sp[[Shaggy|Shaggy (Scooby Doo)]] on a [[baggie|bag]]&sp[[Vegeta|Vegeta (Dragon Ball)]] on a [[cheetah]]<<safe&sp[[Dratini|Dratini (Pokémon)]] in a [[martini]]<<hr2Dratini in a martinihr2>>{{tMain page: [[Dratini in a martini]]}}&sp<<img(src=git/dratini in a martini.jpg(cap=A [[Dratini|Dratini (Pokémon)]] in a [[martini]].img>>The most prolific variation on the Elf on the Shelf meme has been the {{i[[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]]}} Dratini in a martini, garnering [[artworks|artwork]], [[pins|pin]], [[stickers|sticker]], [[sculptures|sculpture]], [[tattoos|tattoo]], and various other creative works.
