  <h1>Elf on the Shelf (meme)</h1>
  <div>The internet meme about the Elf on the Shelf is how the word rhyme, such as elf and shelf. The format of the meme consists of a character or object on another object, such as an elf that is on a shelf. Many open the meme with now get ready for as if the meme is a step up from the elf on the shelf. They often don't explain what the character or object is, requiring the viewer to guess based on their prior knowledge, acting as a puzzle. Occasionally, when there is a container the object is in the, and not on the, container.
There are a wide variety of examples of the meme, including:&spDuck on a truck&spAubrey Graham on a cake&spSeverus Snape (Harry Potter) on a grape&spLEGO on an Eggo&spTide Pods on a slide&spSanta Claus on a Fanta&spWoody (Toy Story) in a hoodie&spYoda (Star Wars) on a soda&spChrome (browser) on a gnome&spWookie (Star Wars) on a cookie&spLuigi on a Fiji&spDarth Vader (Star Wars) on a tater tot&spRuPaul Charles on a U-Haul&spSkeleton on gelatin&spLink (The Legend of Zelda) on a sink&spBart Simpson (Simpsons) in a cart&spShaggy (Scooby Doo) on a bag&spVegeta (Dragon Ball) on a cheetah&spDratini (Pokémon) in a martini
Main page: Dratini in a martini&spThe most prolific variation on the Elf on the Shelf meme has been the Pokémon (fictional species) Dratini in a martini, garnering artwork, pin, sticker, sculpture, tattoo, and various other creative works. This is because of the popularity of the Pokémon franchise and the silly idea behind a Pokémon being tied with an alcoholic beverage.</div>
