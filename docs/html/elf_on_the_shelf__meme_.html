      <h1>Elf on the Shelf (meme)</h1>

The format of the meme consists of a character or object on another object, such as an elf that is on a shelf. Many open the meme with now get ready for as if the meme is a step up from the elf on the shelf. They often don't explain what the character or object is, requiring the viewer to guess based on their prior knowledge, acting as a puzzle. Occasionally, when there is a container the object is in the, and not on the, container.

There are a wide variety of examples of the meme, including:<br>Duck on a truck<br>Drake on a cake<br>Snape on a grape<br>LEGO on an Eggo<br>Tide on a slide<br>Santa on a Fanta<br>Woody in a hoodie<br>Yoda on a soda<br>Chrome on a gnome<br>Wookie on a cookie<br>Luigi on a Fiji<br>Vader on a tater<br>RuPaul on a U-Haul<br>Skeleton on gelatin<br>Link on a sink<br>Bart in a cart<br>Shaggy on a baggie<br>Vegeta on a cheetah<br>Dratini in a martini

Main page: Dratini in a martini<br>The most prolific variation on the Elf on the Shelf meme has been the Pokémon Dratini in a martini, garnering artworks, pins, stickers, sculptures, tattoos, and various other creative works. This is because of the popularity of the Pokémon franchise and the silly idea behind a Pokémon being tied with an alcoholic beverage.</div>
