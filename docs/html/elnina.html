      <h1>Elnina</h1>
      <div>This page contains spoilers for the game {{aiDeltarune.}}<br>Elnina is a Darkner within Deltarune, appearing in Chapter 3 as a miniboss alongside her lover Lanino.

Elnina has light blue skin with a human-based form, with a large nose, red lipstick, and shades. Her hair is white and cloud-like, poofing around her head to her neck with a pair of pigtails. She wears a navy blue dress with white sleeves, red collars, a large black belt with a white circular buckle, and a pointy navy blue and yellow-alternating skirt. She additionally has black pants and a pair of yellow rain boots. She is often holding a yellow pointer with a white hand.<br><br>Elnina's name is a combination of the climate patterns El Niño and La Niña, which like Elnina and Lanino, come together.



At the start of Chapter 3, after the Kris, Susie, and Ralsei agree to play in Mr. Tenna's game show, they walk off the stage to several NPCs present within the Chapter, including Lanino and Elnina posing together.On interaction, the duo introduces themselves as the "boss encounter".<br><br>While the party is playing TV Time: The Legend of Tenna, they can talk with Lanino and Elnina at the oasis who are admiring each other's reflection in the water. After plugging the oasis and returning to Lanino and Elnina, they will start a battle to end their "season of love". During the battle, after three attacks by Lanino and Elnina working together, one will ask the player to pick who they belive has the better attacks, with the ability to pick "Rain" or "Shine". On picking "Rain", the player sides with Elnina, causing her to overshadow Lanino with her attacks, leading to Lanino leaving the battle. Elnina then becomes lonely and misses Lanino, with Mr. Tenna interrupting and ending the battle early. On picking "Shine", the player sides with Lanino, causing him to overshadow Elnina with his attacks, leading to Elnina leaving the battle. Lanino then becomes lonely and misses Elnina, with Mr. Tenna interrupting and ending the battle early.<br><br>When the first round is over and the party heads to the green room, they can find Elnina playing a video game with a Pippins, where she will cry about missing Lanino.<br><br>During the second round inside TV Time: The Legend of Tenna, if the player sided with Elnina, she will be waiting at the Lover's Peak. Otherwise, she will be off to the side, where she will close her eyes and be brought by the party to Lover's Peak. Once Lanino or Elnina arrives at Lover's Peak, it will be revealed that the other was joined by Rouxls Kaard. Ultimately, Elnina and Lanino get together (with Rouxls Kaard) as they still love each other.<br><br>When the second round is over and the party heads to the green room, they see Elnina playing a video game with Lanino and Rouxls Kaard.<br><br>After the party escapes the bonus round, they will head into a bar-like area, where Rouxls Kaard will teleport in with Elnina and Lanino to grab snacks. Rouxls explains that his relationship with Elnina and Lanino will make him that Dark World's "Personal Duke of Puzzles" through the "Transitive Propertie". Elnina and Lanino explain that dating them doesn't make Rouxls the second-in-command off-camera, causing Rouxls to battle the party. During the battle, after taking out the first two rounds of goons, Rouxls sends out Elnina and Lanino, who are eventually coerced into joining the party's side, where they become each other's lovers again. If the player interacted with  Starwalker in Chapter 1, Elnina and Lanino then join Starwalker as a new thruple and walk away.

If Elnina and Lanino are recruited in Chapter 3, they will appear in the Kingdom during Chapter 4 as an optional fight in the Party Dojo. In the TV room in the castle, Elnina and Lanino are together talking about how much they love each other and how weird the lamp (which is Rouxls Kaard hidden under a lampshade) is.</div>
