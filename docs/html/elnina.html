She is often holding a yellow [[pointer|pointer (rod)]] with a white hand.&pElnina's name is a combination of the [[climate]] patterns {{i[[El Niño|El Niño--Southern Oscillation]]}} and {{iLa Niña}}, which like Elnina and Lanino, come together.<<hrPlot involvementhr>><<hr2Chapter 3hr2>>At the start of [[Chapter 3|Deltarune Chapter 3]], after the [[Kris|Kris (Deltarune)]], [[Susie|Susie (Deltarune)]], and [[Ralsei|Ralsei (Deltarune)]] agree to play in [[Mr. Tenna's|Mr. Tenna (Deltarune)]] [[game show]], they walk off the stage to several NPCs present within the Chapter, including Lanino and Elnina posing together.On interaction, the duo introduces themselves as the "boss encounter".&pWhile the party is playing {{i[[TV Time: The Legend of Tenna|TV Time: The Legend of Tenna (Deltarune)]]}}, they can talk with Lanino and Elnina at the oasis who are admiring each other's reflection in the water. After plugging the oasis and returning to Lanino and Elnina, they will start a [[battle|battling (Deltarune)]] to end their "season of love". During the battle, after three attacks by Lanino and Elnina working together, one will ask the player to pick who they belive has the better attacks, with the ability to pick "Rain" or "Shine". On picking "Rain", the player sides with Elnina, causing her to overshadow Lanino with her attacks, leading to Lanino leaving the battle. Elnina then becomes lonely and misses Lanino, with Mr. Tenna interrupting and ending the battle early. On picking "Shine", the player sides with Lanino, causing him to overshadow Elnina with his attacks, leading to Elnina leaving the battle. Lanino then becomes lonely and misses Elnina, with Mr. Tenna interrupting and ending the battle early.&pWhen the first round is over and the party heads to the [[green room]], they can find Elnina playing a video game with a [[Pippins|pippins (Deltarune)]], where she will cry about missing Lanino.&pDuring the second round inside {{iTV Time: The Legend of Tenna}}, if the player sided with Elnina, she will be waiting at the Lover's Peak. Otherwise, she will be off to the side, where she will close her eyes and be brought by the party to Lover's Peak. Once Lanino or Elnina arrives at Lover's Peak, it will be revealed that the other was joined by [[Rouxls Kaard]]. Ultimately, Elnina and Lanino get together (with Rouxls Kaard) as they still love each other.&pWhen the second round is over and the party heads to the green room, they see Elnina playing a video game with Lanino and Rouxls Kaard.&pAfter the party escapes the bonus round, they will head into a bar-like area, where Rouxls Kaard will teleport in with Elnina and Lanino to grab snacks. Rouxls explains that his relationship with Elnina and Lanino will make him that [[Dark World's|Dark World (Deltarune)]] "Personal Duke of Puzzles" through the "[[Transitive Propertie|transitive property]]". Elnina and Lanino explain that dating them doesn't make Rouxls the second-in-command off-camera, causing Rouxls to battle the party. During the battle, after taking out the first two rounds of goons, Rouxls sends out Elnina and Lanino, who are eventually coerced into joining the party's side, where they become each other's lovers again. If the player interacted with  [[Starwalker|Starwalker (Deltarune)]] in [[Chapter 1|Deltarune Chapter 1]], Elnina and Lanino then join Starwalker as a new [[thruple]] and walk away.<<hr2Chapter 4hr2>>If Elnina and Lanino are [[recruited|recruiting (Deltarune)]] in Chapter 3, they will appear in the Kingdom during [[Chapter 4|Deltarune Chapter 4]] as an optional fight in the [[Party Dojo|Party Dojo (Deltarune)]]. In the TV room in the castle, Elnina and Lanino are together talking about how much they love each other and how weird the lamp (which is Rouxls Kaard hidden under a [[lampshade]]) is.</div>
