      <h1>Elytra course (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>An elytra course is an obstacle course that utilizes elytra (Minecraft) flight in Minecraft. The goal is to get through all checkpoint from a start (racing) up to a finish line by flying around and through various obstacles, such as rings, tunnels, and other obstructions, without death (Minecraft) or landing on the ground. Elytra courses can be used for racing, where players try to get to the end with the fastest time. In the Minecraft: Legacy Console editions Minecraft mini games, there is the mini game Glide (Minecraft mini game) where players race along a selected elytra course to get the fastest time or earn the most points by flying through rings.</div>
