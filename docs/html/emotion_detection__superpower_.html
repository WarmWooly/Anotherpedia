If the user can change or affect emotions, it is known as [[emotion manipulation|emotion manipulation (superpower)]] or [[empathy|empathy (superpower)]] instead. Users with emotion manipulation often have emotion detection alongside it, such as [[Mantis|Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)]] in the [[MCU|Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

This power may also be a [[passive ability|passive ability (superpowers)]], such as the [[Grimm|Grimm (RWBY)]] in {{i[[RWBY]]}} who are drawn towards [[negative emotions]]. </div>
