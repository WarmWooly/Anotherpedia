  <h1>Emotion detection (superpower)</h1>
  <div>Emotion detection or emotion sensing is a superpower where the user can sense and determine the current emotion of another person or animal depending on the user's capabilities. If the user can change or affect emotions, it is known as emotion manipulation (superpower) or empathy (superpower) instead. Users with emotion manipulation often have emotion detection alongside it, such as Mantis (Marvel Cinematic Universe) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Emotion detection may require some form of contact between the user and the target, such as the Pokémon (fictional species) Finizen that requires an ultrasonic wave to detect emotions. This power may also be a passive ability (superpowers), such as the Grimm (RWBY) in RWBY who are drawn towards negative emotions.</div>
