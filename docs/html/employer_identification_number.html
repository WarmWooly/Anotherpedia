      <h1>Employer Identification Number</h1>
      <div>The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEI/FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number (FTI/FTIN) is a nine-digit number assigned by the International Revenue Service used to identify business entities. The format of the EIN is 00-0000000. The EIN is a type of Taxpayer Identification Number, similar to a Social Security number. A SSN can be used in place of an EIN in the case the person is the same as the business, such as in sole proprietorships.</div>
