      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The empty spool is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to store multiple items together as spools for bulk winding.



Iron spools can be crafted with 1 stick and 2 wooden slabs (place the stick in the slabs above and below it; makes 4).

Empty spools can be obtained when a Crusher crushes spool blocks.

A bright empty spool can be smoked in a smoker to produce an iron spool, taking 1 second.



Empty spools are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Auto Winder - 2 empty spools, 4 iron composite ingots, and 2 cobblestone (fill the bottom row with iron composite, the left and right slots with cobblestone, the top corners with empty spools, and the top slot with iron composite).<br>Bright Empty Spool x4 - 4 empty spools and 1 glowstone dust (place the dust in the middle and surround it with spools).<br>Copper Spool - 1 empty spool and 8 copper ingots (place the spool in the middle and place the ingots around it).<br>Gold Spool - 1 empty spool and 8 gold ingots (place the spool in the middle and place the ingots around it).<br>Iron Composite Spool - 1 empty spool and 8 iron composite ingots (place the spool in the middle and place the ingots around it).<br>Iron Spool - 1 empty spool and 8 iron ingots (place the spool in the middle and place the ingots around it).<br>Netherite Spool - 1 empty spool and 2 netherite ingots (place the spool in the middle and place the ingots above and below it).<br>Rose Gold Spool - 1 empty spool and 8 rose gold ingots (place the spool in the middle and place the ingots around it).<br>Spool Block - 1 empty spool and 2 wooden slabs (place the spool in the middle and place the slabs above and below it).

Empty spools can be haunted into bright empty spools.
