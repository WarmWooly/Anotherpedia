      <h1>Enhancements (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Enhancements are Modifiers that can be added to playing cards in Balatro. Only one Enhancement can be on a card at a time. If a new Enhancement is added to a card that already has one, the previous Enhancement will be overwritten. Purchasing cards from the Store or from booster packs are ways to get cards with Enhancements, but they may also come from Tarot Cards and Spectral Cards. There are a total of 8 different Enhancements.<<tableName|Effect||Bonus Card|Adds 30 chips when scored.||Mult Card|Adds 4 mult when scored.||Wild Card|Is considered to be every Suit at the same time (&diamondSuit Diamonds, &heartSuit Hearts, &clubSuit Clubs, and <br>adeSuit Spades).||Glass Card|Multiplies the mult by 2, but has a 1 in 4 chance to be destroyed after playing.||Steel Card|Multiplies the mult by 1.5 while in the hand.||Stone Card|Adds 50 chips and is always scored. Does not have a Suit or Rank.||Gold Card|Gives $3 while in the hand at the end of the round.||Lucky Card|Has a 1 in 5 chance to add 20 mult and a 1 in 15 chance to give $20.table>></div>
