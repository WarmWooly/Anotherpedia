      <h1>Episode</h1>
      <div>An episode is an installment within a broadcast, including television programs and streamed serieses. Multiple episodes make up a season within a series, often with a fixed or relatively consistent runtime. Episodes may be released one at a time or all at once. In serialized programming, episodes are usually used to depict a passing of time in the show, with flashbacks and time jumps used when showing elements outside of the current episode's timeframe. Episodes are titled and are numbered based on viewing or release order.</div>
