      <h1>Episode</h1>
      <div>An episode is an installment within a broadcasting, including television program and streaming series. Multiple episodes make up a season (television) within a television series, often with a fixed or relatively consistent runtime (film). Episodes may be released one at a time or all at once. In serialize programming, episodes are usually used to depict a passing of time in the show, with flashback and time jump used when showing elements outside of the current episode's timeframe. Episodes are title and are numbered based on viewing order or release order.</div>
