  <h1>Equipment ({{iMagic: The Gathering}})</h1>
  <div><<shortCard type in Magic: The Gatheringshort>><<img(src=git/sword of vengeance.jpg(cap=The [[Sword of Vengeance|Sword of Vengeance (Magic: the Gathering)]].img>>{{bEquipment}} is a [[subtype|subtype (Magic: the Gathering)]] of [[artifacts|artifact (magic: the gathering)]] with the [[keyword ability|keyword ability (Magic: the gathering)]] of "[[equip|equip (magic: the gathering)]]". It can only be paid for at [[sorcery speed|sorcery speed (Magic: the Gathering)]], where it then [[attaches|attach (Magic: the gathering)]] to a [[creature|creature (Magic: the gathering)]] you have [[control|control (magic: the gathering)]] of. You can also pay the cost to swap the current creature that has the equipment.<<hrRuleshr>><<AsofOctober 2023>>, under the [[Comprehensive Rules|Comprehensive Rules (Magic: the Gathering)]], there is a subsection and separate rule for equipment.&sp&tab{{b303.4.}} Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It can’t legally be attached to anything that isn’t a creature.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4a}} The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the “equipped creature.” The Equipment is attached to, or “equips,” that creature.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4b}} Equipment spells are cast like other artifact spells. Equipment enter the [[battlefield|battlefield (Magic: the Gathering)]] like other artifacts. They don’t enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature you control (see rule 702.6, “Equip”). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that can’t be equipped by it, the Equipment doesn’t move.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4c}} An Equipment that’s also a creature can’t equip a creature unless that Equipment has [[reconfigure|reconfigure (Magic: the Gathering)]] (see rule 702.151, “Reconfigure”). An Equipment that loses the subtype “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.) An Equipment can’t equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipment’s [[controller|controller (magic: the gathering)]] chooses which creature it equips.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4d}} An Equipment’s controller is separate from the equipped creature’s controller; the two need not be the same. Changing control of the creature doesn’t change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the Equipment’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped creature (with “gains” or “has”), the equipped creature’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4e}} If an effect attempts to put an Equipment that isn’t also an [[Aura|Aura (magic: the gathering)]] (see rule 303.4i) onto the battlefield attached to either an object it can’t legally equip or an object that is undefined, the Equipment enters the battlefield unattached. If the Equipment is a token, it’s created and enters the battlefield unattached.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4f}} An ability of a permanent that refers to the “equipped creature” refers to whatever creature that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Equipment.&sp&tab{{b604.4.}} Many Auras, Equipment, and [[Fortifications|Fortification (Magic: the Gathering)]] have static abilities that modify the object they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.</div>
