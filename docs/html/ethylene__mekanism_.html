      <div>Ethylene is a gas in the Minecraft mod Mekanism used for the creation of other chemicals, alongside ore refinery. It can be stored in gas tanks and transported with pressurized tubes.



In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber, the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:<br>10 mB Water + 100 mB Hydrogen + 2 Bio Fuel --> 1 Substrate + 100 mB Ethylene

In a Rotary Condensentrator, the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:<br>1 mB Liquid Ethylene --> 1 mB Ethylene



In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber, the following reactions can be made using ethylene:<br>200 mB Water + 100 mB Ethylene + 1 Substrate --> 8 Substrate + 10 mB Oxygen

In a Rotary Condensentrator, the following reactions can be made using ethylene:<br>1 mB Ethylene --> 1 mB Liquid Ethylene</div>
