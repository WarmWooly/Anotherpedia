      <h1>Ethylene (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>Ethylene is a gas (Mekanism) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Mekanism used for the creation of other chemical, alongside ore (Minecraft) refinery. It can be stored in Gas Tank (Mekanism) and transported with pressurized tube (Mekanism).
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:&sp10 millibuckets Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism) + 2 Bio Fuel (Mekanism) --> 1 substrate (Mekanism) + 100 mB Ethylene
In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:&sp1 mB Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism) --> 1 mB Ethylene
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made using ethylene:&sp200 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Ethylene + 1 substrate (Mekanism) --> 8 substrate (Mekanism) + 10 mB Oxygen (Mekanism)
In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made using ethylene:&sp1 mB Ethylene --> 1 mB Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism)</div>
