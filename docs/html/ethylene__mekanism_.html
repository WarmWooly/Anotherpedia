      <h1>Ethylene (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>Ethylene is a gas (Mekanism) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Mekanism used for the creation of other chemical, alongside ore (Minecraft) refinery. It can be stored in Gas Tank (Mekanism) and transported with pressurized tube (Mekanism).



In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:<br>10 millibuckets Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism) + 2 Bio Fuel (Mekanism) --> 1 substrate (Mekanism) + 100 mB Ethylene

In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:<br>1 mB Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism) --> 1 mB Ethylene



In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made using ethylene:<br>200 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Ethylene + 1 substrate (Mekanism) --> 8 substrate (Mekanism) + 10 mB Oxygen (Mekanism)

In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made using ethylene:<br>1 mB Ethylene --> 1 mB Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism)</div>
