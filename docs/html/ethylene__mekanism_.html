      <h1>Ethylene (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>Ethylene is a gas in the Minecraft mod Mekanism used for the creation of other chemicals, alongside ore refinery. It can be stored in gas tanks and transported with pressurized tubes.
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber, the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:&sp10 mB Water + 100 mB Hydrogen + 2 Bio Fuel --> 1 Substrate + 100 mB Ethylene
In a Rotary Condensentrator, the following reactions can be made to obtain ethylene:&sp1 mB Liquid Ethylene --> 1 mB Ethylene
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber, the following reactions can be made using ethylene:&sp200 mB Water + 100 mB Ethylene + 1 Substrate --> 8 Substrate + 10 mB Oxygen
In a Rotary Condensentrator, the following reactions can be made using ethylene:&sp1 mB Ethylene --> 1 mB Liquid Ethylene</div>
