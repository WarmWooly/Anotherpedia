      <div>For the video by D!NG, see Euler's Disk (D!NG video).&sp "Euler's Disk" is a YouTube Shorts made by Vsauce on January 12, 2025. Michael Stevens (YouTuber) places the Euler's Disk on a mirror surface before spinning it. Michael keeps eye contact throughout the entire video. After the disk spins for 1 minute and 30 second, Michael's eyes widen. The video's description reads:The eerie sound of the spinning disk and the prolonged eye contact without talking gives the video a rather offputting vibe to viewers, especially compared to other videos where Michaels explains how the scientific toy or phenomenon works.</div>
