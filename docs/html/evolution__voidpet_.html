      <h1>Evolution (Voidpet)</h1>
      <div>For the combinational mechanic in {{aiVoidpet Dungeon, see Ascension (aiVoidpet Dungeon).}}<br>Evolution is a process within the Voidpet (franchise) where a Voidpet (fictional species) changes its form and increases in power and ability. Each Voidpet starts at stage one and can be evolved up to stage five. Few Voidpets also have higher form (Voidpet) beyond their fifth stage (not covered here). Each form grows in complexity, with an additional set of eye per stage.

In Voidpet Garden, a Voidpet must reach a certain levels (Voidpet Garden) before they can evolve, with each evolution also costing an increasing amount of void matter (Voidpet Garden) (VM). Plants (Voidpet Garden) also evolve with the same level and VM requirements.<<tableStage|Level|VM||One|r--|r--||Two|r5|r25||Three|r10|r50||Four|r15|r75||Five|r20|r100table>>

<<notice(type=wip(content=This section is a work in progress (Anotherpedia). It is missing the information regarding the max levels for Voidpets based on rarity and stage. You can help by how to make/edit pages.notice>><br>In Voidpet Dungeon, a Voidpet can be evolved using special items (Voidpet Dungeon), which will increase their max levels (Voidpet Dungeon). Rarity (Voidpet) Voidpets will require more items to evolve, but also have a higher base cap per level. Each evolution increases the stats (Voidpet Dungeon) of the Voidpet.<<tableStage|Item|Max Level||One|--|r20/30/40||Two|4/6/8 Evolution Pebble (Voidpet Dungeon)|r30/30/40||Three|8/12/16 Evolution Pebbles|r40/40/40||Four|4/6/8 Evolution Stone (Voidpet Dungeon)|r50/?/?||Five|8/12/16 Evolution Stones|r?/?/?table>></div>
