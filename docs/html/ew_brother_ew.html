      <h1>Ew brother ew</h1>
      <div>Ew brother ew, also Ew, Brother, Ew! and Ew brother ew what's that?, is a internet meme originating from the 2019 video lecture "Are You a Man?! Very Powerful Speech!" spoken by Mohamed Hoblos. The meme has Hoblos in the center of the frame unedited, saying: "Ew, brother, ew! What's that? What's that brother?" During the "brother ew," Hoblos extends his arms out and looks away in disgust, adding to the humorous nature of the meme. It became a prominent TikTok sound on TikTok and a reaction video on Twitter in 2024.</div>
