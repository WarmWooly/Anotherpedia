      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Axe preferred)||Blast resistance|3||Hardness|1||Luminous|No||Transparent|No||Flammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The expanded barrel collector is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to automatically store items that land above it.
The expanded barrel collector can be crafted with 2 barrel collectors and 1 block of iron composite chains (place the barrels to the left and right of the chains)
When an item lands above the expanded barrel collector, it will automatically store the dropped item inside itself. The expanded barrel collector has 63 slots to store items within, 36 more than a barrel collector. The expanded barrel collector can be opened with right-click, even with the top covered. Storing all 52 cobblefiers then opening the expanded barrel collector awards the advancement Cobblestone is Everything.
In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 expanded barrel collector can fuel for 30 seconds (3 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (64 expanded barrel collectors, 1920 seconds, 192 items).</div>
