      <h1>Expatriate</h1>
      <div>An expatriate, or expat, is a person who is outside a country that they have citizenship in. This is often used to signify a temporary leave or that there is still a connection with the original country the expatriate came from. Workers and students abroad are considered expatriates.</div>
