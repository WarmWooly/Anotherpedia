      <h1>Experience (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div>For the enchantment and its associated rune, see experienced (aiNot Lazy Chainmail) and experienced rune (aiNot Lazy Chainmail).<br><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Experience is a placeholder item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail that results when the output of a process produces an experience orb.

When experience is "obtained", an experience orb with a value of 1 is generated instead. If multiple experience would be gained in a single operation, they are combined together.

Experience can be collected by sieving sculk with an iron sieve mesh (4 drops with a 100%, 80%, 50%, and 20% chance respectively). Separation can increase the chance/drops of experience from sieving.</div>
