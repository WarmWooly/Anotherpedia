  <h1>Experience (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div>For the enchantment (Minecraft) and its associated runes (Not Lazy Chainmail), see experienced ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail) and experienced rune (aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}&sp<<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Experience is a placeholder item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail that results when the output of a process produces an experience orb (Minecraft).
When experience is "obtained", an experience orb (Minecraft) with a value of 1 is generated instead. If multiple experience would be gained in a single operation, they are combined together.
Experience can be collected by sieving (Not Lazy Chainmail) Sculk (Minecraft) with an iron sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail) (4 drops with a 100%, 80%, 50%, and 20% chance respectively). Separation (Not Lazy Chainmail) can increase the chance/drops of experience from sieving.</div>
