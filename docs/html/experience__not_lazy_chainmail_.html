When experience is "obtained", an experience orb with a value of 1 is generated instead. If multiple experience would be gained in a single operation, they are combined together.
Experience can be collected by sieving sculk with an iron sieve mesh (4 drops with a 100%, 80%, 50%, and 20% chance respectively). Separation can increase the chance/drops of experience from sieving.</div>
