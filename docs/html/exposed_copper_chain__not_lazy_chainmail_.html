      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|6||Hardness|4||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The exposed copper chain is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used in crafting and as decoration.



The exposed copper chain can be crafted with an exposed block of copper chains (makes 4).

Either through random ticks or by right-clicking with a vinegar bottle, a copper chain will become an exposed copper chain. Using a vinegar bottle to oxidize will award the advancement Oxide On.

Right-clicking a weathered copper chain or a waxed exposed copper chain with an axe will turn the block into an exposed copper chain. Scraping the waxed block will award the advancement Wax Off.
