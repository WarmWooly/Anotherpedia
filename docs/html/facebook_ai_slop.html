      <h1>Facebook AI slop</h1>
      <div>Facebook AI slop is used to describe content posted onto Facebook generated by AI, especially ones made to garner attention, likes, and shares. There are many differing genres of slop generated by different accounts, most run by bots automatically to increase the chance that their posts will receive engagement. The following is a list of some genres that AI slop will contain (often mixed together):;;Religious imagery (often focused on Christianity, Jesus Christ, and the Bible)|Old people celebrating their birthday|Sick or disabled people in hospitals|Patriotic posts with American flags, soldiers, or veterans|Attractive women|Africans with impressive sculptures made of cans, bottles, and other trash|Cute or exotic animals|Airplanes and their cabin crew|Celebreties in unusual locations or situations|Massive trucks filled with random goods, such as American flags, Bibles, and babies|Characters from popular franchises (ex. The Simpsons, Family Guy, Toy Story)</div>
