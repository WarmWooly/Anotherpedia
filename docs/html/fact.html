      <h1>Fact</h1>
      <div>A fact is information that is proven to be true. Facts are one of the most important forms of information, guiding how people think and feel about events, topics, other people, and the world. Facts can be changed or discredited if new information going against the fact shows that the fact is no longer true.</div>
