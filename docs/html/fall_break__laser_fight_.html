      <h1>Fall break (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A fall break is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by jump (Laser Fight) (codeSpace) right before landing from a 35--89 stud drop where fall damage (Laser Fight) would normally ragdoll the player. Jumping too soon or too late will cause the fall break to fail, and spamming jumps before landing will only guarantee ragdolling. Fall breaks can't prevent a player from dying from a lethal height (90+ studs). Landing a fall break will award codedistance/10 rounded down in experience (Laser Fight), giving between 3 and 8.

Main page: Combo ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>

Main page: Roll ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>After landing a fall break, slide (Laser Fight) afterwards will perform a roll (Laser Fight) instead, being a faster, yet shorter burst of speed. Rolling awards 1 exp. If the fall break is after a dive (Laser Fight) (a belly flop (Laser Fight); gives 1 exp), sliding afterwards will perform a belly roll (Laser Fight), which gives 2 exp.

Main page: Leg breaker/yeeter ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>After player performs a lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight) by launching themselves 100+ studs in the air, it can be quite difficult to survive the fall. If the player ollies/nollies towards a raised platform, they can perform a fall break to land a leg breaker/yeeter (Laser Fight), awarding 10 and 12 exp respectively.</div>
