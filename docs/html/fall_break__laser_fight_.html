  <h1>Fall break ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortFall-cancel movement action in {{iLaser Fightshort>><<img(src=git/fall break laser fight.png(cap=A player landing from a fall.img>>A {{bfall break}} is a [[movement action|movement (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} triggered by [[jumping|jump (Laser Fight)]] ({{codeSpace}}) right before landing from a 35--89 stud drop where [[fall damage|fall damage (Laser Fight)]] would normally ragdoll the player. Jumping too soon or too late will cause the fall break to fail, and spamming jumps before landing will only guarantee ragdolling. Fall breaks can't prevent a player from dying from a lethal height (90+ studs). Landing a fall break will award {{codedistance/10}} rounded down in [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]], giving between 3 and 8.<<hrComboshr>>{{tMain page: [[Combo ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&sp<<hr2Rollinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Roll ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spAfter landing a fall break, [[sliding|slide (Laser Fight)]] afterwards will perform a [[roll|roll (Laser Fight)]] instead, being a faster, yet shorter burst of speed. Rolling awards 1 exp. If the fall break is after a [[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]] (a [[belly flop|belly flop (Laser Fight)]]; gives 1 exp), sliding afterwards will perform a [[belly roll|belly roll (Laser Fight)]], which gives 2 exp.<<hr2Leg breaker/yeeterhr2>>{{tMain page: [[Leg breaker/yeeter ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spAfter player performs a [[lethal ollie or nollie|lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight)]] by launching themselves 100+ studs in the air, it can be quite difficult to survive the fall. If the player ollies/nollies towards a raised platform, they can perform a fall break to land a [[leg breaker or yeeter|leg breaker/yeeter (Laser Fight)]], awarding 10 and 12 exp respectively.</div>
