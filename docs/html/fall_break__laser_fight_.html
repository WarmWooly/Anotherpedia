      <h1>Fall break (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A fall break is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by jumping (codeSpace) right before landing from a 35--89 stud drop where fall damage would normally ragdoll the player. Jumping too soon or too late will cause the fall break to fail, and spamming jumps before landing will only guarantee ragdolling. Fall breaks can't prevent a player from dying from a lethal height (90+ studs). Landing a fall break will award codedistance/10 rounded down in exp, giving between 3 and 8.

Main page: Roll (aiLaser Fight)<br>After landing a fall break, sliding afterwards will perform a roll instead, being a faster, yet shorter burst of speed. Rolling awards 1 exp. If the fall break is after a dive (a belly flop; gives 1 exp), sliding afterwards will perform a belly roll, which gives 2 exp.

Main page: Leg breaker/yeeter (aiLaser Fight)<br>After player performs a lethal ollie or nollie by launching themselves 100+ studs in the air, it can be quite difficult to survive the fall. If the player ollies/nollies towards a raised platform, they can perform a fall break to land a leg breaker or yeeter, awarding 10 and 12 exp respectively.</div>
