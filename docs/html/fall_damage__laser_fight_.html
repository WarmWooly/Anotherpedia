      <h1>Fall damage (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Fall damage is a penalty system for falling from a great height in Laser Fight, either ragdolling or killing the player. Fall damage is measured in studs and is calculated by the vertical distance between where the player started falling and their landing position. The following is a list of effects based on fall distance:<<tableDistance|Effect||<35 studs|No effect||35--89 studs|Ragdolling||90+ studs|Deathtable>>&spWhile a player is invincible, they will not take fall damage and instead will make a bouncing sound upon landing from a dangerous fall.
When falling from a height between 35 and 89 studs, the player will start ragdolling, where their body goes limp and moved around as a physics object. The player loses control, can't equip or grab guns, and has their camera sway from left to right. The player will be ragdolled for code(distance / 10) + 1 seconds (ex. a 50-stud drop causes 6 seconds of ragdolling). This penalty can be quite severe, allowing opponents to take advantage of the situation and kill the ragdolled player while they're down.
Main page: Fall break ({{aiLaser Fight)}}&spIf a player jumps right before landing while falling between 35--89 studs, they can perform a fall break, preventing the player from ragdolling. Additionally, the player can then roll for a faster boost of speed compared to sliding. Wallrunning can also be used to cancel fall damage.
If a player falls from a height 90 studs or greater, they will die on impact. The badge 90 Stud Drop is awarded through dying this way. The death screen will say, "Gravity killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X was yeeted to death|X had their legs skewer their brain|X forgot that gravity is real|X learned physics first-hand|X became fresh raspberry jam|X had done a backflip|X can't fly|X became a pancake|X has fallen and can't get up|X had their legs atomized|X forgot to equip their long fall boots|X only had feather falling I|X decreased their potential energy too fast;;On the map Spleef, players can't die from fall damage.
Main page: Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight)}}&spA lethal ollie is a bonus for doing a dive where the player gains 100 studs of height (such as building up a lot of speed and diving into a steep ramp). The outcome is usually death, but if the player lands on a raised surface and fall breaks, they can perform a leg breaker and survive. A lethal nollie requires a slide instead of a dive, being much more difficult, with fall breaking out of it being a leg yeeter. If a player wallruns out of a lethal ollie/nollie, they perform a wall save. Getting a lethal ollie/nollie will award the badge Lethal Ollie.</div>
