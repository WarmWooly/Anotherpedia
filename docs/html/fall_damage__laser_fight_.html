  <h1>Fall damage ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortFalling penalty in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/fall damage laser fight.png(cap=A ragdolled player from falling.img>>{{bFall damage}} is a penalty system for falling from a great height in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}}, either [[ragdolling]] or [[killing|death (Laser Fight)]] the player. Fall damage is measured in studs and is calculated by the vertical distance between where the player started falling and their landing position. The following is a list of effects based on fall distance:<<table{{bDistance}}|{{bEffect}}||<35 studs|No effect||35--89 studs|Ragdolling||90+ studs|Deathtable>>&spWhile a player is [[invincible|invincibility (Laser Fight)]], they will not take fall damage and instead will make a bouncing sound upon landing from a dangerous fall.<<hrRagdollinghr>>When falling from a height between 35 and 89 studs, the player will start ragdolling, where their body goes limp and moved around as a [[physics object]]. The player loses control, can't equip or grab [[guns|gun (Laser Fight)]], and has their camera sway from left to right. The player will be ragdolled for {{code(distance / 10) + 1}} seconds (ex. a 50-stud drop causes 6 seconds of ragdolling). This penalty can be quite severe, allowing opponents to take advantage of the situation and kill the ragdolled player while they're down.<<hr2Fall breakinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Fall break ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spIf a player jumps right before landing while falling between 35--89 studs, they can perform a [[fall break|fall break (Laser Fight)]], preventing the player from ragdolling. Additionally, the player can then [[roll|roll (Laser Fight)]] for a faster boost of speed compared to [[sliding|slide (Laser Fight)]]. [[Wallrunning|wallrun (Laser Fight)]] can also be used to cancel fall damage.<<hrDeathhr>>If a player falls from a height 90 studs or greater, they will [[die|death (Laser Fight)]] on impact. The [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[90 Stud Drop|90 Stud Drop (Laser Fight)]] is awarded through dying this way. The death screen will say, "Gravity killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X was yeeted to death|X had their legs skewer their brain|X forgot that gravity is real|X learned physics first-hand|X became fresh raspberry jam|X had done a backflip|X can't fly|X became a pancake|X has fallen and can't get up|X had their legs atomized|X forgot to equip their long fall boots|X only had feather falling I|X decreased their potential energy too fast;;On the [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] [[Spleef|Spleef (Laser Fight)]], players can't die from fall damage.<<hr2Lethal Ollie/Nolliehr2>>{{tMain page: [[Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spA lethal ollie is a bonus for doing a [[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]] where the player gains 100 studs of height (such as building up a lot of speed and diving into a steep ramp). The outcome is usually death, but if the player lands on a raised surface and [[fall breaks|fall break (Laser Fight)]], they can perform a [[leg breaker|leg breaker/yeeter (Laser Fight)]] and survive. A lethal nollie requires a [[slide|slide (Laser Fight)]] instead of a dive, being much more difficult, with fall breaking out of it being a [[leg yeeter|leg breaker/yeeter (Laser Fight)]]. If a player [[wallruns|wallrun (Laser Fight)]] out of a lethal ollie/nollie, they perform a [[wall save|wall save (Laser Fight)]]. Getting a lethal ollie/nollie will award the [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[Lethal Ollie|Lethal Ollie (Laser Fight badge)]].</div>
