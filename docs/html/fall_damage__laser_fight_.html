  <h1>Fall damage (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bFall damage}} is a penalty system for falling from a great height in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}}, either ragdolling or death (Laser Fight) the player. Fall damage is measured in studs and is calculated by the vertical distance between where the player started falling and their landing position. The following is a list of effects based on fall distance:<<table{{bDistance}}|{{bEffect}}||<35 studs|No effect||35--89 studs|Ragdolling||90+ studs|Deathtable>>&spWhile a player is invincibility (Laser Fight), they will not take fall damage and instead will make a bouncing sound upon landing from a dangerous fall.
When falling from a height between 35 and 89 studs, the player will start ragdolling, where their body goes limp and moved around as a physics object. The player loses control, can't equip or grab gun (Laser Fight), and has their camera sway from left to right. The player will be ragdolled for {{code(distance / 10) + 1}} seconds (ex. a 50-stud drop causes 6 seconds of ragdolling). This penalty can be quite severe, allowing opponents to take advantage of the situation and kill the ragdolled player while they're down.
{{tMain page: Fall break ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spIf a player jumps right before landing while falling between 35--89 studs, they can perform a fall break (Laser Fight), preventing the player from ragdolling. Additionally, the player can then roll (Laser Fight) for a faster boost of speed compared to slide (Laser Fight). wallrun (Laser Fight) can also be used to cancel fall damage.
If a player falls from a height 90 studs or greater, they will death (Laser Fight) on impact. The badge (Roblox) 90 Stud Drop (Laser Fight) is awarded through dying this way. The death screen will say, "Gravity killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X was yeeted to death|X had their legs skewer their brain|X forgot that gravity is real|X learned physics first-hand|X became fresh raspberry jam|X had done a backflip|X can't fly|X became a pancake|X has fallen and can't get up|X had their legs atomized|X forgot to equip their long fall boots|X only had feather falling I|X decreased their potential energy too fast;;On the map (Laser Fight) Spleef (Laser Fight), players can't die from fall damage.
{{tMain page: Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spA lethal ollie is a bonus for doing a dive (Laser Fight) where the player gains 100 studs of height (such as building up a lot of speed and diving into a steep ramp). The outcome is usually death, but if the player lands on a raised surface and fall break (Laser Fight), they can perform a leg breaker/yeeter (Laser Fight) and survive. A lethal nollie requires a slide (Laser Fight) instead of a dive, being much more difficult, with fall breaking out of it being a leg breaker/yeeter (Laser Fight). If a player wallrun (Laser Fight) out of a lethal ollie/nollie, they perform a wall save (Laser Fight). Getting a lethal ollie/nollie will award the badge (Roblox) Lethal Ollie (Laser Fight badge).</div>
