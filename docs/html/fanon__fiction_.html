      <h1>Fanon (fiction)</h1>
      <div>A fanon, combining the terms "fan" and "canon", is information not canon (not explicitly shown), but widely accepted as such by a fanbase. This can be because of the information's continuity matching with the plot/lore or being implied within the source material. Fanon that becomes popular enough can be spun off into fanworks and grow its own community around it.</div>
