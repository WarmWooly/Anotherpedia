      <h1>Fanon vs canon</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Canon, fanon, your design.&spFanon vs canon is a meme format used to mock fandoms when they make substantial changes to a character as displayed in the canon for their own community's fanon. It displays two sides with the words "canon" and "fanon" (or related terms) with a fanon version of the character listed with their fanon attributes and a happier canon version listing all the relevant canon information.</div>
