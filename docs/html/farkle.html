      <h1>Farkle</h1>
      <div>Farkle is a dice game played with six (or in some variations, five) six-sided dice where players roll to try and get the highest-scoring combination of dice based on the probability of getting a good roll. While the only things needed are six dice and a scorekeeping device (such as a piece of paper or a notation app), a dice cup may be used to ensure randomness between rolls.

Farkle is played between two or more players, with each player taking a turn in a round. To win, a player must reach a score of 10,000 or higher. After their turn, all other players get one more turn to try and beat that player's score. Other win conditions, such as having a different score requirement or playing a set number of rounds, can also be used.&pDuring a turn, a player will start with all six dice. All dice are rolled, where the player is allowed to set aside any number of scoring dice. If none of the dice can be used in scoring, then the player has "farkled" and scores no points for their turn. After each roll, the player can choose to score the points they earned and end their turn or continue rolling unscored dice to try and get a higher score while hoping to not farkle. In some variations, the player is required to keep rerolling until they get a certain number of points (such as 500). If all six dice are scored, the player can (or in some variations, must) reroll all their dice to continue adding to their score as if it were the start of their turn, while continuing to risk farkling and losing it all. Scoring dice can't be combined (such as having the two 5's and rolling a third is only worth 150 points and not 500). Once the player ends their turn, the dice are passed to the next player until the win condition is met.

Scoring is often the most variable part of Farkle, with the following base scoring rules that all variations tend to share:<<tableCombination|rScore||Each 1|r100||Each 5|r50||Three 1s|r1000||Three 2s|r200||Three 3s|r300||Three 4s|r400||Three 5s|r500||Three 6s|r600table>>

These are combinations that may be used, with the scoring varying wildly depending on the variation (generally scoring more points for rarer combinations):;;Farkling scores points (2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6)|Three pairs (1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4)|Two triplets (4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6)|Straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)|Short straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)|Full house (2, 2, 2, 3, 3)|Four-of-a-kind and pair (3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5)|Four-of-a-kind (1, 1, 1, 1)|Five-of-a-kind (6, 6, 6, 6, 6)|Six-of-a-kind (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3);;</div>
