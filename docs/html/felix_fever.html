  <h1>Felix FEVER</h1>
  <div>{{bFelix FEVER}} is a {{iWreck-It Ralph}} fan site on Nekoweb (<<link(src=https://felixfever.nekoweb.org/(text=felixfever.nekoweb.orglink>>) primarily based around the character Felix (Wreck-It Ralph). The website was created on February 28, 2024 by the digital artist Gaby Foronda. The site is broken up into many pages, including a variety of content. This includes information on several characters (such as Ralph (Wreck-It Ralph), Vanellope (Wreck-It Ralph), Calhoun (Wreck-It Ralph), and King Candy (Wreck-It Ralph)). Fan art, fan fiction, minigame, and other {{iWreck-It Ralph}}-themed content also inhabit the site. There are also occasional rants against the use of AI across the site. There is a dedicated Discord server for Felix FEVER.
On the home page, there is a dedicated section for "Precautions" describing what could be found on the site. The largest warning is "{{i{{uWATCH OUT FOR PICTURES OF FIX-IT FELIX NAKED OR SHIRTLESS!}}}}", yet still being called only "14 and up". The website also features a bombardment of loud sounds and flickering/flashing lights with poor contrast. Most pages will play different voice lines when hovering over interactive elements. The language on the website may be profanity at some points.</div>
