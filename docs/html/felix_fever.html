      <div><<short{{iWreck-It Ralph}} fan siteshort>><<img(src=git/felix fever.png(cap=A [[screenshot]] of Felix FEVER.img>>{{bFelix FEVER}} is a {{i[[Wreck-It Ralph]]}} [[fan site]] on [[Nekoweb]] (<<link(src=https://felixfever.nekoweb.org/(text=felixfever.nekoweb.orglink>>) primarily based around the [[character]] [[Felix|Felix (Wreck-It Ralph)]]. The website was created on February 28, 2024 by the [[digital artist]] [[Gaby Foronda]]. The site is broken up into many pages, including a variety of content. This includes information on several characters (such as [[Ralph|Ralph (Wreck-It Ralph)]], [[Vanellope|Vanellope (Wreck-It Ralph)]], [[Calhoun|Calhoun (Wreck-It Ralph)]], and [[King Candy|King Candy (Wreck-It Ralph)]]). [[Fan art]], [[fan fics|fan fiction]], [[minigames|minigame]], and other {{iWreck-It Ralph}}-themed content also inhabit the site. There are also occasional rants against the use of [[AI]] across the site. There is a dedicated [[Discord server]] for Felix FEVER.<<hrConcerns and precautionshr>>On the home page, there is a dedicated section for "Precautions" describing what could be found on the site. The largest warning is "{{i{{uWATCH OUT FOR PICTURES OF FIX-IT FELIX NAKED OR SHIRTLESS!}}}}", yet still being called only "14 and up". The website also features a bombardment of loud sounds and flickering/flashing lights with poor contrast. Most pages will play different voice lines when hovering over interactive elements. The language on the website may be [[profane|profanity]] at some points.<<hrWebsitehr>><<web(src=https://felixfever.nekoweb.org/(cap=The [[home page]] for Felix FEVER.web>></div>
