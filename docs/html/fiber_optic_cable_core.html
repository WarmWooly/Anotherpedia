      <h1>Fiber Optic Cable Core</h1>
      <div>For the core of optical fiber, see core (optical fiber).<br>Fiber Optic Cable Core, also known as Noun-Posting, is a meme in which noun in a clip (media) is then represented with an image of the noun on-screen for a brief period of time after it is said by a character or person. It is typically paired with the noun being repeated with minor audio distortion. It first appeared on TikTok in 2023 and has since spread to YouTube and YouTube Shorts. Since the meme's original use, it now may include other word which are not nouns and even phrase with only loosely connected imagery. Despite the first video being from The Sopranos (being a scene related to fiber-optic cable, hence the name), the YouTuber Markiplier has become a staple for many Fiber Optic Cable Cores. Fiber Optic Cable Core is possibly a spur off of Corecore.</div>
