Some, such as the [[Fidget Cube]], have multiple tactile movements for different hand motions. Others such as the [[fidget spinner]] rely on a single motion, such as [[spinning]] a [[ball bearing]]. There are also some, like the [[Infinity Cube]] or [[bike chain|bike chain (fidget toy)]], that require constant movement of the hands. There are also a plethora of [[tactile]] toys, where the main [[gimmik]] is not the motion, but rather the [[texture]] of the toy.</div>
