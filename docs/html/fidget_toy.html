      <h1>Fidget toy</h1>
      <div>A fidget toy is a small handheld toy with the purpose to be a device that the hands can be used to fidget with. Some, such as the Fidget Cube, have multiple tactile movements for different hand motions. Others such as the fidget spinner rely on a single motion, such as spinning a ball bearing. There are also some, like the Infinity Cube or bike chain, that require constant movement of the hands. There are also a plethora of tactile toys, where the main gimmik is not the motion, but rather the texture of the toy.</div>
