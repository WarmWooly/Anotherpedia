      <h1>Filament (incandescent light bulb)</h1>
      <div>A filament in an incandescent light bulb is a thin conducting coiled wire that connect to the contact wires, which glows due to heat generated by the resistance to the electricity flowing through the filament. Tungsten is the most used material for filaments due to tungsten's ability to withstand heat for long periods of time while conducting electricity.</div>
