      <div><<info||Stats||Health|100 HP||Speed|300%||Size|175%||Min.<br>Kills|100 killsinfo>>The Final Boss Roomba is the last boss enemy in Attack of the Roombas, having the abilities of the Factory Roomba (Attack of the Roombas), Cannon Roomba (Attack of the Roombas), Trapper Roomba (Attack of the Roombas), and Healer Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas). Every 10 seconds (or 12 seconds if it just spawned), a Minion Roomba (Attack of the Roombas) will be generated. Every 8.33 seconds, a Trap Roomba (Attack of the Roombas) will be generated. Every 5 seconds, it will shoot a rubber ball. Every 2 seconds, the Final Boss Roomba will heal 1 HP if damaged. The Final Boss Roomba will only appear once, and upon defeating it, will grant the player (Attack of the Roombas) a decreased reload time. To prevent an infinite score farm, each time the Final Boss Roomba heals, 1 score is removed.</div>
