      <h1>Find the exact value for cos(4pi/3)</h1>
      <div>"Find the exact value for cos(4pi/3)" is a YouTube video made by MSolved Tutoring on November 8, 2017, describing how to solve a cosine equal to 4 times pi divided by 3. The video depicts a unit circle chart with the sine and cosine values of various angle, alongside a pointer used to draw information throughout the video. The video is 45 second in length.

So I want to find the cosine of 4 pi over 3.<br>Full unit around is pi, so we're left with pi over 3 left, so it's actually down here.<br>And the cosine's -1, this is 2, and this is -square root3.<br>So it looks like this, the circle I'm going off of.<br>But this is cosine, so it's adjacent over hypotenuse, so this is going to be equal to -1/2.<br>It's -1, then the half, or 2.<br>Ok, that's it.

YouTube comment on the video suggests that the information provided was not satisfactory when trying to solve for cos(4&mpi/3). The main issue with the video is the lack of explanation for where the values of the triangle used to solve cosine come from (-1, 2, and -√3). Most information in the video is assumed to be known by the viewer, despite not being the case for many.</div>
