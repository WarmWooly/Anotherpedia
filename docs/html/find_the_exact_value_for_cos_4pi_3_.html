  <h1>Find the exact value for cos(4pi/3)</h1>
  <div><<shortYouTube video solving cos(4&mpi/3)short>><<img(src=git/cosine 4pi3.jpg(cap=The [[thumbnail]] of the video.img>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/unmfChvfcPc(cap=The video on YouTube.yt>>"{{bFind the exact value for cos(4pi/3)}}" is a [[YouTube]] [[video]] made by [[MSolved Tutoring]] on November 8, 2017, describing how to solve a [[cosine]] equal to 4 times [[pi]] divided by 3. The video depicts a [[unit circle chart]] with the [[sine]] and cosine values of various [[angles|angle]], alongside a pointer used to draw information throughout the video. The video is 45 [[seconds|second]] in length.<<hrTranscripthr>>So I want to find the cosine of 4 pi over 3.&spFull unit around is pi, so we're left with pi over 3 left, so it's actually down here.&spAnd the cosine's -1, this is 2, and this is -[[√|square root]]3.&spSo it looks like this, the circle I'm going off of.&spBut this is cosine, so it's adjacent over [[hypotenuse]], so this is going to be [[equal]] to -1/2.&spIt's -1, then the half, or 2.&spOk, that's it.<<hrCriticismhr>>[[Comments|YouTube comment]] on the video suggests that the information provided was not satisfactory when trying to solve for cos(4&mpi/3). The main issue with the video is the lack of explanation for where the values of the [[triangle]] used to solve cosine come from (-1, 2, and -√3). Most information in the video is assumed to be known by the viewer, despite not being the case for many. </div>
