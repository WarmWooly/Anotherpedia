      <h1>Find the exact value for cos(4pi/3)</h1>
      <div>"Find the exact value for cos(4pi/3)" is a YouTube video made by MSolved Tutoring on November 8, 2017, describing how to solve a cosine equal to 4 times pi divided by 3. The video depicts a unit circle chart with the sine and cosine values of various angles, alongside a pointer used to draw information throughout the video. The video is 45 seconds in length.

So I want to find the cosine of 4 pi over 3.&spFull unit around is pi, so we're left with pi over 3 left, so it's actually down here.&spAnd the cosine's -1, this is 2, and this is -√3.&spSo it looks like this, the circle I'm going off of.&spBut this is cosine, so it's adjacent over hypotenuse, so this is going to be equal to -1/2.&spIt's -1, then the half, or 2.&spOk, that's it.

Comments on the video suggests that the information provided was not satisfactory when trying to solve for cos(4&mpi/3). The main issue with the video is the lack of explanation for where the values of the triangle used to solve cosine come from (-1, 2, and -√3). Most information in the video is assumed to be known by the viewer, despite not being the case for many.</div>
