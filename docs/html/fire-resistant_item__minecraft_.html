      <h1>Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>A fire-resistant item in Minecraft is an item, that when thrown into fire or lava as an entity, will not burn and will not be destroyed. Fire-resistant items will slowly float in lava like items in water. Only netherite-related items have fire resistance, while all others will be destroyed as normal. Fire-resistant items can still be destroyed by other means, such as explosions, cacti, and being thrown into the void. There are currently 13 fire-resistant items in Minecraft <<asofJune 2025>>:;;Ancient Debris|Block of Netherite|Netherite Axe|Netherite Boots|Netherite Chestplate|Netherite Helmet|Netherite Hoe|Netherite Ingot|Netherite Leggings|Netherite Pickaxe|Netherite Scrap|Netherite Shovel|Netherite Sword;;</div>
