  <h1>Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)</h1>
  <div>A {{bfire-resistant item}} in {{iMinecraft}} is an item (Minecraft), that when thrown into fire (Minecraft) or lava (Minecraft) as an item (Minecraft entity), will not burn and will not be destroyed. Fire-resistant items will slowly float in lava like items in water (Minecraft). Only netherite (Minecraft)-related items have fire resistance, while all others will be destroyed as normal. Fire-resistant items can still be destroyed by other means, such as explosion (Minecraft), cactus (Minecraft), and being thrown into the void (Minecraft). There are currently 13 fire-resistant items in {{iMinecraft}} <<asofJune 2025>>:;;Ancient Debris (Minecraft)|Block of Netherite (Minecraft)|Netherite Axe (Minecraft)|Netherite Boots (Minecraft)|Netherite Chestplate (Minecraft)|Netherite Hemlet (Minecraft)|Netherite Hoe (Minecraft)|Netherite Ingot (Minecraft)|Netherite Leggings (Minecraft)|Netherite Pickaxe (Minecraft)|Netherite Scrap (Minecraft)|Netherite Shovel (Minecraft)|Netherite Sword (Minecraft);;</div>
