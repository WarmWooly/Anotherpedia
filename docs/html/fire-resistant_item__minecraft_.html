      <h1>Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>A fire-resistant item in Minecraft is an item (Minecraft), that when thrown into fire (Minecraft) or lava (Minecraft) as an item (Minecraft entity), will not burn and will not be destroyed. Fire-resistant items will slowly float in lava like items in water (Minecraft). Only netherite (Minecraft)-related items have fire resistance, while all others will be destroyed as normal. Fire-resistant items can still be destroyed by other means, such as explosion (Minecraft), cactus (Minecraft), and being thrown into the void (Minecraft). There are currently 13 fire-resistant items in Minecraft <<asofJune 2025>>:;;Ancient Debris (Minecraft)|Block of Netherite (Minecraft)|Netherite Axe (Minecraft)|Netherite Boots (Minecraft)|Netherite Chestplate (Minecraft)|Netherite Hemlet (Minecraft)|Netherite Hoe (Minecraft)|Netherite Ingot (Minecraft)|Netherite Leggings (Minecraft)|Netherite Pickaxe (Minecraft)|Netherite Scrap (Minecraft)|Netherite Shovel (Minecraft)|Netherite Sword (Minecraft);;</div>
