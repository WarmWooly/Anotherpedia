      <h1>Firewood</h1>
      <div>Firewood is a type of wood fuel using wood from trees with little processing used as fuel for a fire. Most firewood comes in the form of logs (both whole and split) and branches. Firewood is measured in cords based on their dry volume when racked and are most often sold by the cord or half cord. Firewood is kept dry and protected from the elements to allow it to burn efficiently. Firewood is used for cooking, heating, small-scale industrial use, to create charcoal, and other similar purposes. Firewood may be dried in a kiln to greatly reduce the time required for drying.</div>
