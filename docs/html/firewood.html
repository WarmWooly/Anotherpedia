  <h1>Firewood</h1>
  <div>{{bFirewood}} is a type of wood fuel using wood from tree with little processing used as fuel for a fire. Most firewood comes in the form of log (both whole wood and split wood) and branch. Firewood is measured in cord (unit) based on their dry measurement volume when racked and are most often sold by the cord or half cord. Firewood is kept dry and protected from the elements (outdoors) to allow it to burn efficiently. Firewood is used for cooking, heating, small-scale industrial use, to create charcoal, and other similar purposes. Firewood may be wood drying in a kiln to greatly reduce the time required for drying.</div>
