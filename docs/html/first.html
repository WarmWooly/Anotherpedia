The direct item behind the first is known as second.<br><br>It is commonly seen as a success to be the first of something, such as the first to cross a finish line or the first to invent a new thing. Metals such as gold are used as a symbol for getting first place.<br><br>This is the first page on Anotherpedia.</div>
