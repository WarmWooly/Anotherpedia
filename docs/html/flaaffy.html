      <h1>Flaaffy</h1>
      <div>Flaaffy is a sheep-based bipedal Electric type Pokémon from the second generation.
Flaaffy has a pink, rotund body with pairs of arms and legs, a tail, and a white wool-covered neck below its head. It has flipper-like arms and more defined legs, with the front part of its feet being white. Its tail has three black stripes connecting to a blue bulb. Its head has a rounded ovoid shape, with a mouth, flush nostrils, a pair of blue eyes, and a pair of conical horns with two black stripes on each. Its wool around its neck extends around the back of its head, wrapping above the head while making a pair of curls on the top.&pFlaaffy's official size is 2 ft and 7 in., while weighing 29.3 lbs. Shiny Flaaffies have slightly more muted skin, pink-ish wool, and a green orb instead of blue.&pFlaaffy's name possibly comes from fluffy, with the 'aa' either deriving from baa or from AA batteries.
Flaaffy's wool is packed with electricity, causing its tail bulb to glow when completely filled. Its power causes parts of its rubbery, insulating skin to be bare of wool. Flaaffy can launch its charged hairs at opponents.
A Flaaffy has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Flaaffy is the 180th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color pink.&pFlaaffy evolves from Mareep at level 15 and into Ampharos at level 30. Flaaffy's leveling rate is "Medium Slow".</div>
