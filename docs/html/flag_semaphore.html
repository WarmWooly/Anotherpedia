The way [[information]] is [[encoded|encoding]] in the flags is by their [[position]].&pThe [[standard]] flag used for flag semaphore is comprised of a short pole attached to a flag, where one triangular half is yellow, and the other is red. If the message is being sent on [[land]] and not at [[sea]], the colors would be white and blue. Flags are not required, only being used to make it more obvious what is being sent. The flags will not overlap unless a space is being sent.<<hrJapanese flag semaphorehr>>There is a unique code made for [[Japanese]], where the left flag is white and the right one is red. Due to the nature of the [[characters|character (linguistics)]], it can take up to three positions before a character is sent.<<hrPopular culturehr>>[[The Beatles|The Beatles (band)]]' [[album cover]] for their [[album|music album]] {{i[[Help!|Help! (album)]]}} has the Beatles semaphoring {{iRujv}}. This is because the semaphore for {{iHelp}} did not seem [[appealing|appeal]].&pIn the [[comedy]] [[series]] {{i[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python's Flying Circus (show)]]}}, they semaphored {{i[[Wuthering Heights|Wuthering Heights (novel)]]}}.&pIn the [[anime]] {{i[[Classroom of the Elite]]}}, [[Hideo Sotomura|Hideo Sotomura (Classroom of the Elite)]] signals the following messages in Japanese flag semaphore:<<quoたすけ もとむ ({{iTasuke motomu}}, or [[translated|translation]] to [[English]], {{iHelp requested}})quo>><<quo試着室 から 注意 を そらす ({{iShichakushitsu kara chūi o sorasu}}, or translated, {{iDraw attention away from the changing room}})quo>></div>
