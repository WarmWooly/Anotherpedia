      <h1>Flag semaphore</h1>
      <div>Flag semaphore is a type of semaphore that uses hand-held devices, such as flags, to visually transmit messages. The way information is encoded in the flags is by their position.&pThe standard flag used for flag semaphore is comprised of a short pole attached to a flag, where one triangular half is yellow, and the other is red. If the message is being sent on land and not at sea, the colors would be white and blue. Flags are not required, only being used to make it more obvious what is being sent. The flags will not overlap unless a space is being sent.
There is a unique code made for Japanese, where the left flag is white and the right one is red. Due to the nature of the characters, it can take up to three positions before a character is sent.
