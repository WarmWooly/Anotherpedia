      <h1>Flint (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>Flint is an item in Minecraft that is often used in crafting tools and weapons.
Flint can be obtained by mining gravel, where there is a 10% chance that flint will drop instead of gravel on destruction. When mined with Fortune, it increases to 16%, 25%, and 100% with I, II, and III respectively. Silk Touch and falling on non-solid blocks will never cause gravel to drop flint.
In both Bedrock and Java, the chances to find flint in chests are the following:&spA chest by a ruined portal has a 46.4% chance to contain 1-4 flint.&spIn a village, a chest in a Fletcher's house will have a 55.8% chance of containing 1-3 flint.
When trading, there is a 50%s-p(Bedrock only) chance or a 66.67%s-p(Java only) chance for a Novice-level fletcher to trade 10 flint for 10 gravel and 1 emerald.
Flint is used in the following crafting recipes:&spArrow x4 - 1 flint, 1 stick, and 1 feather (with each item listed stacked on top of each other, from top to bottom)&spFletching Table - 2 flint and 4 planks (make a 2x2 square of planks on the bottom, then place the flint above it)&spFlint and Steel - 1 flint and 1 iron ingot (shapeless)
For Apprentice-level fletchers, there is always a trade of 26 flint for an emerald.&spFor Apprentice-level leatherworkers, there is a 100%s-p(Bedrock only) chance or a 66.67%s-p(Java only) chance to trade 26 flint for an emerald.&spFor Journeyman-level toolsmith, there is a 100%s-p(Bedrock only) chance or a 40%s-p(Java only) chance to trade 30 flint for an emerald.&spFor Journeyman-level weaponsmith, there is always a trade of 24 flint for an emerald.</div>
