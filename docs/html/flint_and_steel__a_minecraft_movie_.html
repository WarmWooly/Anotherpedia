      <h1>Flint and Steel (A Minecraft Movie)</h1>
      <div>Flint and steel is the Minecraft item flint and steel present within A Minecraft Movie that became a meme due to its usage in promotional material for the movie. The flint and steel was first seen 37 seconds into "A Minecraft Movie &vl Final Trailer" on February 27, 2025, becoming a meme phrase from the movie due to how Steve (Jack Black) yelled "Flint and steel!" while using it.

Steve, while exploring with his tamed wolf Dennis, finds the flint and steel in a chest beside an "obsidian gateway" (a Nether portal), which he uses on the gateway after repairing it. This causes the gateway to activate, making a connection to the Nether.</div>
