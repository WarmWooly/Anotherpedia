      <h1>Flint and Steel (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|64s-uJE/65s-uBE||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Flint and steel is a tool in Minecraft that can be used to ignite blocks and mobs and to create fire.



Flint and steel can be crafted with 1 flint and 1 iron ingot (shapeless).

In both Bedrock and Java, the chances to find flint in chests are the following:<br>A chest by a ruined portal has a 46.4% chance to contain 1 flint and steel.<br>A chest in a nether fortress has a 19% chance to contain 1 flint and steel.



On right click, a fire will be created on a block as long as it is on the top or on the side of a flammable block.<br>Igniting a valid obsidian frame will activate a nether portal.<br>TNT will activate and count an attack made by the player on detonation. It will not ignite, but rather place fire on the TNT if it is clicked while sneaking.<br>Creepers will be forced to explode when ignited. This can't be canceled by getting out of its radius.<br>Unlit candles and campfires and be lit using a flint and steel.<br>Dispensers holding a flint and steel on activated will ignite blocks such as campfires and TNT.

Flint and steel can be enchanted using an anvil and enchanted books with Unbreaking (max III), Mending (max I), and Curse of Vanishing (max I).</div>
