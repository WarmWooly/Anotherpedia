      <h1>Flint and Steel (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|64s-uMinecraft: Java Edition/65s-uMinecraft: Bedrock Edition||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Flint and steel is a tool (minecraft) in Minecraft that can be used to igniton block (minecraft) and mob (minecraft) and to create fire (minecraft).



Flint and steel can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 flint (Minecraft) and 1 iron ingot (Minecraft) (shapeless).

In both Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition, the chances to find flint in chest (Minecraft) are the following:<br>A chest by a ruined portal (Minecraft) has a 46.4% chance to contain 1 flint and steel.<br>A chest in a nether fortress (Minecraft) has a 19% chance to contain 1 flint and steel.



On right click, a fire will be created on a block as long as it is on the top or on the side of a flammable block (Minecraft).<br>Igniting a valid obsidian (Minecraft) frame will activate a nether portal (Minecraft).<br>TNT (Minecraft) will activate and count an attack made by the player on detonation. It will not ignite, but rather place fire on the TNT if it is clicked while sneaking (Minecraft).<br>Creeper (Minecraft) will be forced to explode when ignited. This can't be canceled by getting out of its radius.<br>Unlit candle (Minecraft) and campfire (Minecraft) and be lit using a flint and steel.<br>dispenser (Minecraft) holding a flint and steel on activated will ignite blocks such as campfires and TNT.

Flint and steel can be enchanting (Minecraft) using an anvil (Minecraft) and enchanted book (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft) (max III), Mending (Minecraft) (max I), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft) (max I).</div>
