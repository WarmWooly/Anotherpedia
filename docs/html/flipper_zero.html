There is also a mobile app on the Apple App Store and on Google Play.

There are a lot of uses for the Flipper Zero. Usage may be considered illegal when used on property not owned by the person using the device.

You have the ability to clone RFID and NFC using a Flipper Zero. These can be used to bypass many ID scanners that have little security.

The infrared transceiver can replicate remotes for a wide array of appliances, including TVs, ACs, and all-in-one remotes.

The GPIO pins allow use in programming and interacting with simple devices. This can also lead to adding attachments to make the Flipper Zero more powerful.

A Flipper Zero can be made to brute-force passwords to be able to log into devices unwillingly.
