      <h1>Flow worm (fictional species)</h1>
      <div>Flow worms are a fiction species within the rhythm game Bits & Bops, appearing within the Minigames (Bits & Bops) Flow Worms (Bits & Bops), Sky Mixtape (Bits & Bops), and Final Mixtape (Bits & Bops). They are seen bouncing other flow worms along their heads to move them along.

Flow worms are bug-like, with tall, rounded bodies and a large head. They have two legs and four arms, with a pair of antenna at the top. Flow worms have black dot eyes and a smoothed W-shape mouth. Their bodies are one color, while their limbs and the area around their mouth are a different shade. Flow worms are seen bioluminescence in the dark. During the Sky Mixtape, all but the controlled flow worm have a pair of small wings and a halo over their heads.</div>
