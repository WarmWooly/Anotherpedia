      <div><<shortStrongest superacidshort>><<img(src=git/fluoroantimonic acid.png(cap=A [[diagram]] of the structure of fluoroantimonic acid.(brightImgimg>>{{bFluoroantimonic acid}} is a [[mixture]] between [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[antimony pentafluoride]]. Fluroantimonic acid comes in the form of a [[colorless]] [[liquid]]. Fluoroantimonic acid's [[chemical formula]] is [[Sb|Antimony]][[H|Hydrogen]][[F|Fluorine]]{{s-b6}}. It is considered [[corrosive]] due to how [[acidic|acidity (chemistry)]] and a [[health hazard]] due to being [[lethal|lethality]] on [[digestion]] or [[inhalation]], severe [[skin burns|chemical burn]], and a potential [[carcinogen]].&pFluoroantimonic acid is considered a [[superacid]] due to being trillions of times more acidic than 100% [[sulfuric acid]], with a [[H{{s-b0}}|hammett acidity function]] of -28.<<hrReactionhr>>The [[reaction|chemical reaction]] between hydrogen fluoride and antimony pentafluoride is the following:<<quoSbF{{s-b5}} + 2HF &equ SbF{{s-b6}}{{s-p−}} + H{{s-b2}}F{{s-p+}}quo>>The true reaction is more complex, but this is a good [[approximation]] of the reaction. The reaction is [[exothermic|exothermic reaction]], where fluorine is stripped from a hydrogen fluoride alongside the hydrogen's [[electron]] as they combine with the antimony pentafluoride. This makes the [[hexafluoroantimonate ion]] (SbF{{s-b6}}{{s-p-}}). The single hydrogen atom combines with another hydrogen fluoride to make the [[fluoronium]] (H{{s-b2}}F{{s-p+}}).</div>
