  <h1>Fluoroantimonic acid</h1>
  <div>Fluoroantimonic acid is a mixture between hydrogen fluoride and antimony pentafluoride. Fluroantimonic acid comes in the form of a colorless liquid. Fluoroantimonic acid's chemical formula is AntimonyHydrogenFluorines-b6. It is considered corrosive due to how acidity (chemistry) and a health hazard due to being lethality on digestion or inhalation, severe chemical burn, and a potential carcinogen.&pFluoroantimonic acid is considered a superacid due to being trillions of times more acidic than 100% sulfuric acid, with a hammett acidity function of -28.
The chemical reaction between hydrogen fluoride and antimony pentafluoride is the following:The true reaction is more complex, but this is a good approximation of the reaction. The reaction is exothermic reaction, where fluorine is stripped from a hydrogen fluoride alongside the hydrogen's electron as they combine with the antimony pentafluoride. This makes the hexafluoroantimonate ion (SbFs-b6s-p-). The single hydrogen atom combines with another hydrogen fluoride to make the fluoronium (Hs-b2Fs-p+).</div>
