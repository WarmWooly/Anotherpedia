      <h1>Flygon</h1>
      <div>Flygon is a bug-like bipedal Ground Type (Pokémon) and Dragon Type (Pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation III (Pokémon).

Flygon has a light green body, with a rounded bottom and long, thick neck. A pair of red-trimmed kite (shaped) wings connect to its upper back. It has short, three-clawed arms and large legs with toeless feet, with the tops of the legs and the ends of the feet a darker green. Its tail has four dark green stripes, with a V-shaped cutout pointing towards the end at the top of the first three stripes. At the end of its tail are three red-trimmed kite shapes stacked together. Its head has a pair of dark green, long, and pointed antenna-like horns, eyes covered with a translucent red spheroids, flush nostrils, and a mouth.<br><br>Flygon's official size is 6 foot (unit) and 7 inch, while weighing 180.8 Pound. Shiny (Pokémon) Flygons are a light blue instead of dark green, with a gold (color)-like yellow replacing red.<br><br>Flygon is possibly a portmanteau of fly and dragon (or a rearrangement of dragonfly).

Flygon can use its wings to kick up sand in desert and generate sandstorm to keep itself hidden and trap prey (notably Krookodile). It has shields that cover their eyes to prevent sand from blinding them. When Flygon flaps its wings, the sound resembles a woman singing, which it can use to attract prey. Because of this, it is known as "the elemental spirit of the desert" or "the Desert Spirit". This sound can even be faintly heard while Flygon sleep. The sound it generates can cause person to become lost, or worse...

A Flygon has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Flygon is the 330th Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color green.<br><br>Flygon evolution (pokémon) from Vibrava at level (pokémon) 45, which evolves from a level 35 Trapinch. Flygon's leveling rate is "Medium Slow".</div>
