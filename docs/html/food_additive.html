      <h1>Food additive</h1>
      <div>A food additive is a substance, whether natural or synthetic, that is added to food to improve appearance, taste, texture, nutrition, shelf life, or other desirable attribute of it. As "food additive" is relatively broad, salt, sugar, and corn syrup are the most common food additives used in the United States. Other food additives includes citric acid, carrageenan, sodium nitrite, and tartrazine.</div>
