In this age of ever-more elaborate diets and conflicting health advice, Food Rules brings welcome simplicity to our daily decisions about food. Written with clarity, concision, and wit that has become bestselling author Michael Pollan’s trademark, this indispensable handbook lays out a set of straightforward, memorable rules for eating wisely, one per page, accompanied by a concise explanation.

Whether at the supermarket or an all-you-can-eat buffet, this is the perfect guide for anyone who ever wondered, “What should I eat?”<br><br>"In the more than four decades that I have been reading and writing about the findings of nutritional science, I have come across nothing more intelligent, sensible and simple to follow than the 64 principles outlined in a slender, easy-to-digest new book called Food Rules: An Eater’s Manual, by Michael Pollan." —Jane Brody, {{iThe New York Times<br><br>"It doesn't get much easier than this. Each page has a simple rule, sometimes with a short explanation, sometimes without, that promotes Pollan's back-to-the-basics-of-food (and-food-enjoyment) philosophy." —The Los Angeles Times}}

<<AsofDecember 2024>>, this book has a rating of 4.4/5 star (rating) on Amazon (company). Here are a few ratings:<br><br>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - S Williams, United States on September 26, 2024<br>A very quick read<br>This is a very quick read of his rules for eating healthy, which is basically too avoid processed food.<br><br>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - CDOI, United States on August 29, 2011<br>A Gem Given to 'Fast Foodie' Friends and Loved Ones<br>The 'One Star Reviewers' seemed primarily let down by the simplicity and sparse length of this book. Most had read earlier works by the author and expected/hoped for more content in this brief book. I get that... But as a spring board to healthful eating concepts, given to 'fast foodie' loved ones(and we all have them)this book is a gem. I have studied healthy diet, nutrition and cooking techniques for many years. I found this book an easily digestible overview and reminder of much valuable information, that can be given as a caring non-offensive gift to loved ones and friends. Why do I use the word non-offensive? Because people embrace, guard, defend and protect their habituated food practices as fiercely as any other habitual substance. Food Rules presents simple stripped down truths regarding having a healthy relationship with food. That's it - that's all. I am gifting this book to many of my friends and loved ones -why? Because, being unsolicited, it is a short read that they may actually read through, and one that could turn out to be the impetus for change in their relationships with food. Face it - we all have loved ones and friends who are sick, obese, addicted to poor eating habits and toxic food choices. Many who are responsible for the eating habits of future generations. They may think of you as a 'health nut' and look for a quick exit when the topic of health and diet surfaces in conversation. Okay - so gift them with this book. If you are reading this you obviously value healthy eating - pay it forward and who knows...it may be the spring board of consciousness that gives your loved one a toe hold on changing this most important life factor.<br><br>⭐⭐⭐ - C. B. St Hilaire, United States on May 8, 2010<br>a very basic guide to cure the American diet woes<br>I do think this would cure America, but I also think that this book was so/so. Don't get me wrong - I think that Michael Pollan is wonderful and I'm so grateful that he exists as a writer and researcher. However, if you are a healthy eater at all or have any concern for what goes into your body (and what shouldn't), then you know what is in here already. And I'm guessing that most people that even look at this Amazon record already have put a lot of thought into their diet. It took me 20 minutes to read this book. It is simply little clips and short rules to adhere to: don't eat something that is pink and in a tube--GoGurt--eat real food instead; stay away from overprocessed stuff; stop eating before you are full; eat mostly plants; etc. I am a vegetarian and very aware of what I'm eating, so I am probably more critical than the masses who think that fast food is still an OK thing to eat.<br><br>I gave this a 3 because I don't think it is a bad thing to refer to from time to time. I also think it is good to pass it to someone you just know doesn't eat their veggies and thinks that they can drink soda all day long.<br><br>However, if you already understand the basic realities of how to eat healthy in this overprocessed world, then you can save your $5 and buy another one of Pollan's books instead.</div>
