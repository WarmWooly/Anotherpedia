  <h1>Fortnight</h1>
  <div>A fortnight is a period of time over 14 day, or 2 week. This term has slowly faded out in British English and American English because of the limited use cases and the simplicity of "two weeks" compared to "a fortnight." Fortnight is said to have come from Middle English, being a combination of fourteen and night. A fortnight is nearly half a lunar month.</div>
