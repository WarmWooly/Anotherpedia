This term has slowly faded out in [[Britsh|British English]] and [[American English]] because of the limited use cases and the simplicity of "two weeks" compared to "a fortnight." Fortnight is said to have come from [[Middle English]], being a combination of {{i[[fourteen]]}} and {{i[[night]]}}. A fortnight is nearly [[half]] a [[lunar month]].</div>
