      <h1>Forward pass (American football)</h1>
      <div>A forward pass is when the football is thrown in the same direction the offensive team is trying to go. If the ball is caught by the same team, then it is considered a completion, but if the ball is caught by the opposing team, it is considered an interception. If the ball touches the ground or goes out of bounds, it is considered an incomplete pass.</div>
