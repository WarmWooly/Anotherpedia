      <h1>Forward pass (American football)</h1>
      <div>A forward pass is when the football (American football) is thrown in the same direction the offensive team (American football) is trying to go. If the ball is caught by the same team, then it is considered a completion (American football), but if the ball is caught by the opposing team, it is considered an interception (American football). If the ball touches the ground or goes out of bounds (American football), it is considered an incomplete pass (American football).</div>
