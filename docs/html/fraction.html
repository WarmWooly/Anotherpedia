  <h1>Fraction</h1>
  <div>A fraction is a representation in mathematics of part of a whole quantity which is not a whole number (i.e. half, third). Fractions have a numerator and a denominator, with the numerator above the denominator and a line between. Fractions can be converted into a division equation and vice versa. Fractions aid in keeping numbers compact and easy to calculate compared to decimal (i.e. 0.666... = 2/3). Fractions may be represented with a whole number counterpart, such as 7/2 = 3 1/2.</div>
