  <h1>Fraction</h1>
  <div><<shortNumerical representation of part of a wholeshort>><<img(src=git/fraction.svg(cap=Examples of fractions with [[shapes|shape]].(brightImgimg>>A {{bfraction}} is a [[representation]] in [[mathematics]] of [[part]] of a [[whole]] [[quantity]] which is not a [[whole number]] (i.e. [[1/2|half]], [[1/3|third]]). Fractions have a [[numerator]] and a [[denominator]], with the numerator above the denominator and a line between. Fractions can be converted into a [[division]] [[equation]] and vice versa. Fractions aid in keeping numbers compact and easy to calculate compared to [[decimals|decimal]] (i.e. 0.666... = 2/3). Fractions may be represented with a whole number counterpart, such as 7/2 = 3 1/2.</div>
