      <h1>Franzient</h1>
      <div>Franzient was a Minecraft Better Than Wolves SMP created by Franzy in September 2024 in response to multiple players being banned from Transient Season 6. The founding players of Franzient include Franzy, ITL Supress (server host), Igorex, Warm_Wooly, and ChrisMC127.



A team of players was assembled for Transient Season 6, including ITL Supress, Franzy, Cahd, Warm_Wooly, Igorex, Lonmower, and Shadda for September 28, 2024. When the server opened, it was repeatedly crashing and going down. When the server stabilized, a fistfight occurred at spawn, including Franzy and Cahd, who attacked Battosay. Battosay, a moderator for the Better Than Wolves Discord server and Transient, banned Franzy and Cahd from the server. Warm, Lon, and Shadda would venture out to survive. Igorex would later become un-whitelisted from the server. After the first few nights, the idea of a separate server was created.

Franzy would create the Discord server for Franzient the same day as the opening of Season 6, adding Cahd, Igorex, Warm_Wooly, Lonmower, ChrisMC127, and ITL Supress. To start, the originating members of Franzient started seed hunting for a good seed for the first season of Franzient. Multiple seeds, including code-6179774138385506497, code-9057352651117540831, codeTransient fell off, codeBetter than omega smp, and codeFranzyient is goog would be tested, with codeFRANZY being selected because of its nearby proximity to a Desert Temple, Villages, and a Mineshaft with Melon Seeds. The server would open the following day with a plan set in place to survive the first nights.

Season 0 of Franzient, a test run for a server separate from Transient, ran on Better Than Wolves 3.0.0a Beta (Minecraft 1.6.4), the latest beta release for Better Than Wolves when the server was started (September 29, 2024). The IP for the server was codefranzient.itlesports.com. The server was closed on November 20, 2024, after lasting for 53 days. The server was closed due to inactivity after completing the full SFS beacon three weeks prior.

Upon starting the server, Shafts and Sharp Stones were swiftly collected, with Igorex and Franzy focusing on looting the Desert Temple and Warm collecting food and building a hole for the night. During the looting of the Desert Temple, a Pile of Sand fell on the Pressure Plate, destroying the Powder Kegs and Hampers. Warm, Franzy, and Igorex held out the night in the base, with Warm becoming the "cook" of the group as they ate the no-longer-local wildlife that was harvested. When day broke again, the group continued forth to collect food and resources to prepare for a Brick Oven.



A common phrase at the start of the server was "Transient is skibidi while Franzient is hawk tuah". The meme hawk tuah would continue to be prominent amongst server members, along with references to Among Us, Parkour Civilization, and "Chris cow pen".

The server had progressed to a Crucible when animals started to get wrangled to the base to harvest food and other resources. After a pair of Sheep were brought over to the base, Franzy ventured out to collect Cows and tasked ChrisMC127 (shortened to Chris) with constructing a pen to house the Cows on October 2, 2024. Chris started creating a large wall out of Cobbled Blackstone that formed with the terrain, with no set shape, size, or wall height. When Franzy returned to the base with a pair of Cows, he became outraged when he saw the sorry, unfinished state of the pen. Chris would repeatedly place blocks, causing the Cows to panic and kick Franzy as the Sun started to set. Warm aided in adding lighting through Blocks of Redstone and patched up several holes and openings in the pen. A Creeper then blew a hole in the wall the same night, requiring it to be patched. Fortunately, both the Cows survived the endeavor.<br><br>On October 26th, one of the Cows was killed, leaving only one remaining in the pen. It is unknown how the Cow was killed.

ITL Supress, the host of the server, acted as a "god" for the server, flying around in Creative Mode and creating large structures. ITL was mostly passive when it came to player affairs, and he was not seen abusing his power to an absurd degree. ITL created two structures, each with a different purpose. The first structure was a large temple made out of Stone Bricks that held a Nether Portal. Franzy symbolically destroyed 10 Obsidian to pay for "access" to the portal held within. The temple was also used to host Franzy's birthday. Chests full of gear, materials to build a Wither, and other valuable items and blocks were inside, but they were later destroyed as they were seen as going too far. A second structure made out of Quartz Blocks was also created, acting as a pseudo-mob farm. This was never used and was removed after the structure got broken up through the second wave of chunk corruption.

ITL's server was prone to crashing or going offline. Two of these crashes caused chunk corruption. The first one on October 5th caused minor displacement of chunks, with little repercussions caused by the relatively few structures built around the base. The second wave of chunk corruption on October 10th caused more relative damage. The ladder to the Squid Farm and the staircase to the End Portal were removed. The Cauldron and Wolves connected to the base were relocated, disturbing the Melon farm. The pseudo-mob farm was separated into three different chunks before being torn down. The nearby Village also had buildings misplaced, but none of the Villagers went missing. Chris' cow pen had to be quickly patched up again as a portion of the wall was misplaced. Paths and other minor structures were repaired throughout the rest of the day.

The first Wither was fought by Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and Chris on October 9, 2024. The Wither fight took place in 3rd strata in a location roughly 1000 blocks away from the base connected via the Nether. The room was then carved out to support the Wither, with several small interconnected tunnels to allow players to safely weave and travel in case of danger. Franzy and Warm came equipped mostly with diamond armor, with Chris and Igorex mostly wearing leather and padded armor respectively. All four players came equipped with Diamond Swords and Picks, Potions of Healing, and Compound Bows and Arrows to take pot shots at the Wither. After the Wither was constructed, the players all ran into separate tunnels to avoid hitting others in the crossfire. The bombardment of arrows quickly chipped away at the Wither's health, bringing it to its second phase. The players then rushed the Wither with swords, splashing potions close to others to maximize the healing. The Wither was then defeated, and Igorex collected the Nether Star, and it dropped. The Nether Star was then used to turn a Dormant Soulforge into a Soulforge.<br><br>Franzy would complete a second Wither fight on October 20, 2024, in full diamond armor to obtain the second Nether Star required for a Beacon. Franzy was streaming the Wither fight, getting coached by Battosay throughout.

The Ender Dragon was fought by Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and Chris on October 13, 2024. Franzy, Igorex, and Warm came equipped with full diamond (mostly full for Igorex), while Chris came in with chainmail. All players had Snowballs, Diamond Swords and Picks, Potions of Healing, and Water Buckets. Igorex and Warm came with Compound Bows and Arrows, while Franzy had a Bow and Rotted Arrows. All players hopped into the End Portal at the same time and dug out a staircase to the surface. Chris, Igorex, and Franzy collected End Stone to process after the battle. The group created large bodies of Water to protect themselves from Endermen and from being launched by the Ender Dragon, using Snowballs and Arrows to take out the End Crystals on the pillars around the island. After the End Crystals were dealt with, the players grouped up and shot at the Ender Dragon as it swooped down. Chris died during one of the swoops, effectively kept out of the rest of the fight. Igorex had also been injured several times throughout the fight by the Ender Dragon's constant bombardment. The Ender Dragon was finally slain, with Franzy collecting the Dragon Egg before the remaining players returned to the Overworld.

Better Than Tuah was a fictional podcast between Franzy, Warm_Wooly, Battosay, and "guest" Wdbittle on October 26th. The name was a play on Better Than Wolves and Talk Tuah with Haliey Welch. The location was a 4x4 White Stone Table with a 2x2 Netherrack firepit embedded inside, with a 6x6 ring of White Stone Benches to stand on next to the base. During the period, discussions regarding chocolate within the United States, the number of ingredients within ketchup based on country, the 2024 United States presidential election, voter registration in Indiana, Conservative media in the United States including Fox News, learning English through popular media, and Wdbittle's Newgrounds favorited art history were conducted. Wdbittle was killed multiple times by Franzy for tossing items into the firepit, including Sawdust, Loose Stones, and Loose Cobblestone Slabs, with Warm teleporting Wdbittle back. The podcast ended when Battosay's connection to the Discord call impeded talking and listening at the same time.

After the Ender Dragon was defeated, the server was immediately geared towards creating Soulforged Steel to create a full SFS beacon to set spawn. Iron was harvested from the Stronghold and nearby Mineshafts prior to prepare some iron. Warm created a Silverfish Farm while Igorex constructed an auto Kiln, auto Saw, mass Mill Stone, auto Urn turner and Soul-er, and other invaluable machines to create SFS. Franzy and Calebrune3 had spent most of the time collecting mass amounts of iron for SFS. On October 31, 2024, the 164 Blocks of Soulforged Steel was fully obtained. Warm_Wooly and Tetro48 assembled the full SFS beacon in the End, with Tetro48 being the first player to bind themselves to it.
