      <h1>Franzient</h1>
      <div>Franzient was a Minecraft Better Than Wolves Minecraft Survival Multiplayer created by franzy14 in September 2024 in response to multiple player (Minecraft) being banned from Transient (Better Than Wolves SMP) Season 6. The founding players of Franzient include Franzy, ITL Supress (server host), igorex95, Warm_Wooly, and ChrisMC128.



A team of players was assembled for Transient Season 6, including ITL Supress, Franzy, Cahd, Warm_Wooly, Igorex, Lonmower, and Shadda for September 28, 2024. When the server opened, it was repeatedly crashing and going down. When the server stabilized, a fistfight occurred at spawn, including Franzy and Cahd, who attacked Battosay. Battosay, a moderator for the Better Than Wolves Discord server and Transient, ban (Minecraft) Franzy and Cahd from the server. Warm, Lon, and Shadda would venture out to survive. Igorex would later become un-whitelisted from the server. After the first few nights, the idea of a separate server was created.

Franzy would create the Discord server for Franzient the same day as the opening of Season 6, adding Cahd, Igorex, Warm_Wooly, Lonmower, ChrisMC127, and ITL Supress. To start, the originating members of Franzient started seed hunting (Minecraft) for a good seed for the first season of Franzient. Multiple seeds, including code-6179774138385506497, code-9057352651117540831, codeTransient fell off, codeBetter than omega smp, and codeFranzyient is goog would be tested, with codeFRANZY being selected because of its nearby proximity to a Desert Temple (Better Than Wolves), Village (Better Than Wolves), and a Mineshaft (Better Than Wolves) with Melon Seeds (Better Than Wolves). The server would open the following day with a plan set in place to survive the first nights.

Season 0 of Franzient, a test run for a server separate from Transient, ran on Better Than Wolves 3.0.0a Beta (Minecraft: Java Edition 1.6.4), the latest beta release for Better Than Wolves when the server was started (September 29, 2024). The IP for the server was codefranzient.itlesports.com. The server was closed on November 20, 2024, after lasting for 53 days. The server was closed due to inactivity after completing the full SFS beacon three weeks prior.

Upon starting the server, Shaft (Better Than Wolves) and Sharp Stone (Better Than Wolves) were swiftly collected, with Igorex and Franzy focusing on looting the Desert Temple and Warm collecting food and building a hole for the night. During the looting of the Desert Temple, a Pile of Sand (Better Than Wolves) fell on the Wooden Pressure Plate (Better Than Wolves), destroying the Powder Keg (Better Than Wolves) and Hamper (Better Than Wolves). Warm, Franzy, and Igorex held out the night in the base, with Warm becoming the "cook" of the group as they ate the no-longer-local wildlife that was harvested. When day broke again, the group continued forth to collect food and resources to prepare for a Brick Oven (Better Than Wolves).



A common phrase at the start of the server was "Transient is skibidi while Franzient is hawk tuah". The internet meme hawk tuah would continue to be prominent amongst server members, along with references to Among Us, Parkour Civilization, and "Chris cow pen".

The server had progressed to a Crucible (Better Than Wolves) when animals started to get wrangled to the base to harvest food and other resources. After a pair of sheep (Better Than Wolves) were brought over to the base, Franzy ventured out to collect Cow (Better Than Wolves) and tasked ChrisMC127 (shortened to Chris) with constructing a pen to house the Cows on October 2, 2024. Chris started creating a large wall out of Cobbled Blackstone (Better Than Wolves) that formed with the terrain, with no set shape, size, or wall height. When Franzy returned to the base with a pair of Cows, he became outraged when he saw the sorry, unfinished state of the pen. Chris would repeatedly place blocks, causing the Cows to panic and kick Franzy as the Sun (Minecraft) started to set. Warm aided in adding lighting through Block of Redstone (Better Than Wolves) and patched up several holes and openings in the pen. A Creeper (Better Than Wolves) then blew a hole in the wall the same night, requiring it to be patched. Fortunately, both the Cows survived the endeavor.<br><br>On October 26th, one of the Cows was killed, leaving only one remaining in the pen. It is unknown how the Cow was killed.

ITL Supress, the host of the server, acted as a "god" for the server, flying around in Creative Mode (Minecraft) and creating large structures. ITL was mostly passive when it came to player affairs, and he was not seen abusing his power to an absurd degree. ITL created two structures, each with a different purpose. The first structure was a large temple made out of Stone Brick (Better Than Wolves) that held a Nether Portal. Franzy symbolically destroyed 10 Obsidian (Better Than Wolves), to pay for "access" to the portal held within. The temple was also used to host Franzy's birthday. Chests full of gear, materials to build a Wither (Better Than Wolves), and other valuable items and blocks were inside, but they were later destroyed as they were seen as going too far. A second structure made out of Quartz Block (Better Than Wolves) was also created, acting as a pseudo-mob farm (Better Than Wolves). This was never used and was removed after the structure got broken up through the second wave of chunk corruption.

ITL's server was prone to server crash or going offline. Two of these crashes caused chunk corruption (Minecraft). The first one on October 5th caused minor displacement of chunks, with little repercussions caused by the relatively few structures built around the base. The second wave of chunk corruption on October 10th caused more relative damage. The ladder to the Squid Farm (Better Than Wolves) and the staircase to the End Portal were removed. The Cauldron (Better Than Wolves) and Wolf (Better Than Wolves) connected to the base were relocated, disturbing the Melon (Better Than Wolves) farm. The pseudo-mob farm was separated into three different chunks before being torn down. The nearby Village (Better Than Wolves) also had buildings misplaced, but none of the Villager (Better Than Wolves) went missing. Chris' cow pen had to be quickly patched up again as a portion of the wall was misplaced. Paths and other minor structures were repaired throughout the rest of the day.

The first Wither (Better Than Wolves) was fought by Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and Chris on October 9, 2024. The Wither fight took place in Strata (Better Than Wolves) in a location roughly 1000 Block (Minecraft unit) away from the base connected via the Nether (Better Than Wolves). The room was then carved out to support the Wither, with several small interconnected tunnels to allow players to safely weave and travel in case of danger. Franzy and Warm came equipped mostly with diamond armor, with Chris and Igorex mostly wearing leather and padded armor respectively. All four players came equipped with Diamond Sword (Better Than Wolves) and Diamond Pickaxe (Better Than Wolves), Potion of Healing (Better Than Wolves), and Compound Bow (Better Than Wolves) and Arrow (Better Than Wolves) to take pot shots at the Wither. After the Wither was constructed, the players all ran into separate tunnels to avoid hitting others in the crossfire. The bombardment of arrows quickly chipped away at the Wither's health, bringing it to its second phase. The players then rushed the Wither with swords, splashing potions close to others to maximize the healing. The Wither was then defeated, and Igorex collected the Nether Star (Better Than Wolves), and it dropped. The Nether Star was then used to turn a Dormant Soulforge (Better Than Wolves) into a Soulforge (Better Than Wolves).<br><br>Franzy would complete a second Wither fight on October 20, 2024, in full diamond armor to obtain the second Nether Star required for a Beacon (Better Than Wolves). Franzy was streaming the Wither fight, getting coached by Battosay throughout.

The Ender Dragon (Better Than Wolves) was fought by Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and Chris on October 13, 2024. Franzy, Igorex, and Warm came equipped with full diamond (mostly full for Igorex), while Chris came in with chainmail. All players had Snowball (Better Than Wolves), Diamond Swords and Picks, Potions of Healing, and Water Bucket (Better Than Wolves). Igorex and Warm came with Compound Bows and Arrows, while Franzy had a Bow (Better Than Wolves) and Rotted Arrow (Better Than Wolves). All players hopped into the End Portal (Minecraft) at the same time and dug out a staircase to the surface. Chris, Igorex, and Franzy collected End Stone (Better Than Wolves) to process after the battle. The group created large bodies of Water (Better Than Wolves) to protect themselves from Enderman (Better Than Wolves) and from being launched by the Ender Dragon, using Snowballs and Arrows to take out the End Crystal (Better Than Wolves) on the pillars around the island. After the End Crystals were dealt with, the players grouped up and shot at the Ender Dragon as it swooped down. Chris died during one of the swoops, effectively kept out of the rest of the fight. Igorex had also been injured several times throughout the fight by the Ender Dragon's constant bombardment. The Ender Dragon was finally slain, with Franzy collecting the Dragon Egg (Better Than Wolves) before the remaining players returned to the Overworld (Better Than Wolves).

Better Than Tuah was a fictional podcast between Franzy, Warm_Wooly, Battosay, and "guest" Wdbittle on October 26th. The name was a play on Better Than Wolves and Talk Tuah with Haliey Welch. The location was a 4x4 White Stone Table (Better Than Wolves) with a 2x2 Netherrack (Better Than Wolves) firepit embedded inside, with a 6x6 ring of White Stone Bench (Better Than Wolves) to stand on next to the base. During the period, discussions regarding chocolate within the United States, the number of ingredient within ketchup based on country, the 2024 United States presidential election, voter registration in Indiana, Conservative media in the United States including Fox News, learning English through popular media, and Wdbittle's Newgrounds favorited art history were conducted. Wdbittle was killed multiple times by Franzy for tossing item (Minecraft) into the firepit, including Sawdust (Better Than Wolves), Loose Stone (Better Than Wolves), and Loose Cobblestone Slab (Better Than Wolves), with Warm teleporting Wdbittle back. The podcast ended when Battosay's connection to the Discord call impeded talking and listening at the same time.

After the Ender Dragon was defeated, the server was immediately geared towards creating Soulforged Steel (Better Than Wolves) to create a full SFS beacon to set spawn. Iron ingot (Better Than Wolves) was harvested from the Stronghold (Better Than Wolves) and nearby Mineshaft (Better Than Wolves) prior to prepare some iron. Warm created a Silverfish Farm (Better Than Wolves) while Igorex constructed an auto Kiln (Better Than Wolves), auto Saw (Better Than Wolves), mass Mill Stone (Better Than Wolves), auto Unfired Urn (Better Than Wolves) Turntable (Better Than Wolves) and Soul Urn (Better Than Wolves), and other invaluable machines to create SFS. Franzy and Calebrune3 had spent most of the time collecting mass amounts of iron for SFS. On October 31, 2024, the 164 Block of Soulforged Steel (Better Than Wolves) was fully obtained. Warm_Wooly and Tetro48 assembled the full SFS beacon in the End (Better Than Wolves), with Tetro48 being the first player to bind themselves to it.
