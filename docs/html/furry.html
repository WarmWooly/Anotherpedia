      <h1>Furry</h1>
      <div>For the anthropomorphic mix between dogs and other mammals with humans, see furry (anthropomorphic animal).<br>Furry is an adjective in which the object or animal has a similar appearance to or which is covered in fur. An example would be saying that an old, ragged cleaning cloth was gray and furry. While furry is used for thick covering over a body, hairy describes a less dense mass of hair, with hairy associated with humans and furry for other hair-covered mammals.</div>
