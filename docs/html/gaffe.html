      <h1>Gaffe</h1>
      <div>A gaffe is a blunder when talking that causes embarrassment to the one speaking. It's socially awkward to let a gaffe slip out, but most have little effect on a situation. Gaffes are most likely seen when a political figure makes a mistake, such as during an interview or speech. Gaffes are usually only as long as a phrase or a sentence, but it may also form from a single word or along multiple sentences. Gaffes can occasionally be good, lightening up the mood or showing a more imperfect, human side of a person.</div>
