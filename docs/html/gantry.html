      <h1>Gantry</h1>
      <div>A gantry is an overhead support structure made out of steel to hold up something. Gantries can have legs extending to the ground to be affixed or connected to wheels (especially on railroad tracks) to make the gantry mobile. Gantry cranes utilize a gantry to hold a crane above a payload. Gantries are also seen holding highway signs, railway signals, and cameras above roads and along railways.</div>
