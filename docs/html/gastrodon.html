  <h1>Gastrodon</h1>
  <div>Gastrodon is a sea slug-like water type (pokémon) and Ground type (Pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation IV (Pokémon).
Gastrodon resembles a slug with a pair of black eyes with large white pupils, with the third 'eye' in the middle being a fake marking. The separation from its underbelly and top is yellow, crossing under the eyes, while having six legs. West Sea Gastrodons have a pink underbelly and a brown top, while East Sea Gastrodons have a cyan underbelly and a green top. West Sea Gastrodons also have six pink spots and two lumps on their backs, alongside a pair of brown horns and tendrils on their heads, while East Sea Gastrodons have four cyan spots and two wavy yellow-edged fins on their backs with a pair of green tentacles on their heads.&pGastrodon's official size is 2 foot (unit) and 11 inch, while weighing 65.9 Pound. shiny (pokémon) Gastrodons have a golden trim instead of yellow, with West Sea Gastrodons a redder pink and yellower brown and East Sea Gastrodons a lighter blue and yellower green.&pIt is likely that Gastrodon is a portmanteau consisting of gastropod, with the other portion unclear.
Gastrodon is most often located at shoreline, feeding off of plankton in the sea and beach sand on land. They will use an acidic mucus to melt prey. They often go on land when it rain to avoid drying out. When in danger, they can produce a sticky, yet harmless, purple goo to dissuade attackers. They also leave a sticky trail while moving. They used to have shell, but devolve them. They are also able to regeneration at an extremely fast rate, even when dismemberment.&pDespite no changes besides aesthetics, when the weather permits, the two forms of Gastrodon may be seen fight each other.
Gastrodon has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Gastrodon is the 423rd Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color purple or blue (form-dependent).&pGastrodon evolves from Shellos (pokémon), which will be in its West and East Sea form respectively. Gastrodon's leveling rate is "Medium Fast".</div>
