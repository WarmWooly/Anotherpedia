      <h1>Geeking off Elixer</h1>
      <div>"Geeking off Elixer" is a diss track created by Sklumper and released on May 11, 2024. The song is a diss on the character Fergus (a reoccurring antagonist in Sklumper's 13th Century Live Streams).

Oh my, this ale is quite strong<br>It's gonna have me speaking my mind pretty soon<br>Fergus, we went to your kingdom and nobody knows who you are<br><br>I'm smoking on my opps (opps)<br>Serf's about to turn up,<br>We're not talking 'bout our crops<br>You're maidens in my field,<br>Oh my heavens, what's she doing in there?<br>She can't believe our yield (noo)<br>Gold around my neck,<br>But all my armor's made of steel (yeah, right)<br><br>Fergus, you're my top opp<br>This wagon is a drop top<br>Arrow to your dome, yeah<br>I bet it make your heart stop<br>Your maiden is for the streets<br>We don't want to fix her<br>Smoking Fergus pack<br>And I'm geeking off elixer<br><br>We're geeking off this elixer<br>My, oh my gosh<br>Fergus, not sure you can step outside the castle walls after that one</div>
