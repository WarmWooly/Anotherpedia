      <h1>Generator Room (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Generator Room is a room in the map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp that is used to store the Facility's power generator. It slowly uses fuel over time, which can be refueled by a Maintenance Staff (SCP: Devolved Revamp) member with a jerrycan (SCP: Devolved Revamp). The room is located in Sector 1 of the Facility labeled "Generator" with an electrical hazard warning sign above. The room requires a Level 1 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp) to enter.<br><br>On the left and right sides of the room, multiple crates and jerrycans are lying around, and on the left side, right when the player enters the room, there is a rack filled with jerrycans and a note above that says "(please do not drink the gas) ((it's expensive))". The room is lit up by one LED panel and two wall lights on the back wall that are between a TV. At the back of the room sits the generator, with writing that resembles a company name on it that says "STUDTECH Electronics". The generator's fuel percentage can be seen by walking up to the generator, and a prompt to fill it will appear.</div>
