      <h1>Geometry</h1>
      <div>Geometry is a study under mathematics relating to points, lines, shapes, solids, and other objects related to their dimension. The earliest form of geometry was Euclidean geometry, strictly relating to physical space. It is taught in elementary schools early on, which aids in a child's development and observational abilities of the world around them.</div>
