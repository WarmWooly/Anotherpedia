      <h1>George Washington's skin cancer</h1>
      <div>Source issue: George Washington did have lesions in his skin, but it is not fully clear if it was specifically a form of melanoma. Because of that, this page is debatable.&spGeorge Washington had possibly suffered from melanoma, a type of skin cancer. In June of 1794, Washington was treated by Dr. James Tate, who cut into the flesh to remove the tumor. It is rumored that Washington requested Tate to cut deeper to make sure that the cancer couldn't spread. The operation seemed to be a success, as Washington no longer had this supposed skin cancer.</div>
