      <h1>Gift</h1>
      <div>For the current point in time, see present.<br> A gift or present is something, usually a physical object, that is given to someone without expected payment. Traditionally, a layer of wrapping paper will cover the entire gift, in order to surprise the recipient, as they will have to rip off the wrapping to reveal their gift. Gifts are commonly given to friends or loved ones as a reward for something, or for a special occasion, such as Christmas or their birthday.</div>
