      <h1>Glass</h1>
      <div>Glass is a brittle material which is often transparent. The most common method of production is to mix sand with soda ash and lime and to rapidly cool after heating. Glass is often used in construction (mainly windows), drinkwear, and storage (jars, beakers, test tubes, etc.).</div>
