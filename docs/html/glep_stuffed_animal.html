      <h1>Glep stuffed animal</h1>
      <div>This is for fan-made items related to the character. For the official product (business), see Adult Swim Official - Smiling Friends Glep Plushie.<br>A Glep stuffed animal or Glep plush is a stuffed toy of the Smiling Friends character Glep (Smiling Friends). While there have been limited official releases of Glep as a stuffed animal in 2024 (San Diego Comic-Con 2024 in July and on Amazon (company) in November), Smiling Friends fandom have created their own Glep toys to both have and sell. The quality of each stuffed animal would vary from person to person, especially as it was often made for the creator or as a gift. Most of the stuffed animals are handmade and amateur, with plushes being sold tending to be of higher quality. Sewing and crochet are prominent methods of producing stuffed Gleps. While they tend to be on the smaller side (~6 inch), a few creations are life-sized (1 foot (unit) and 6 in.).</div>
