      <h1>Gloom (Better Than Wolves)</h1>
      <div>Gloom is the effect of being in complete darkness (light level 0) in the Minecraft mod Better Than Wolves, punishing players who are in complete darkness with negative effects and eventually death. Light levels that low can be caused by going into caves, hiding in a hole, being in an unlit building, or being outside during a new moon. Every 8 days (the length of the moon cycle) there will be a new moon. As the world always starts on a full moon, there are 5 days to get some light for the night. There is no way to see while in darkness, so  it is imperative to obtain a light source.

As a player spends more time in darkness, the effects caused will worsen. After 2 minutes, they will start to be eaten by a grue (based on the game Zork).<<tableEffect|Cause|Result||Gloom|Enter darkness|50% mining and movement speed||Dread|Stay in darkness for 1 minute|Wolf growling sounds play||Terror|Stay in darkness for 2 minutes|Take 1 damage randomly over timetable>></div>
