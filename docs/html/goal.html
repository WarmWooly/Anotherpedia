  <h1>Goal</h1>
  <div><<shortTarget for completionshort>><<img(src=git/goal.jpg(cap=A person using the acronym to make it easier to reach their goal.img>>A {{bgoal}} is a [[target]] that is set to be [[completed|completion]].<<hrAcronymhr>>There is an [[acronym]] associated to creating goals:<<quo{{bS}} - Specific&sp{{bM}} - [[Measureable|Measurement]]&sp{{bA}} - Attainable&sp{{bR}} - [[Relevant|Relevancy]]&sp{{bT}} - [[Time-Tabled|Time Constraint]]quo>><<hr2Specifichr2>>Specific refers to making goals that have a clear [[criteria]] for completion. If a goal is not specific, it will be harder to tell when it is reached. It will also decrease the ability to gauge how far along someone is to complete a goal.<<hr2Measureablehr2>>It is important to make sure that there is a [[metric]] or other measurement that can be used as a way to see how far someone is into a goal. Goals that can't be measured compound the difficulty of completing a goal.<<hr2Attainablehr2>>Goals which are [[impossible]] or highly unlikely to be completed should not be gone after because it will [[waste]] [[time]] and [[resources|resource]] on something that can't or most likely won't be completed.<<hr2Relevanthr2>>Going for goals which do not align with a [[person]] will only make it even harder to complete. Goals should be relevant to the person and for the wanted [[outcome]].<<hr2Time-tabledhr2>>A goal should have a [[time constraint]] to limit [[procrastination]] and [[delays|delay]]. Goals with an unclear end date are much more likely to be pushed back further, potentially to the point where the goal can no longer be completed.</div>
