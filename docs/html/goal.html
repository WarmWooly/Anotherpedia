      <h1>Goal</h1>
      <div>A goal is a target that is set to be completed.

There is an acronym associated to creating goals:S - Specific<br>M - Measureable<br>A - Attainable<br>R - Relevant<br>T - Time-Tabled

Specific refers to making goals that have a clear criteria for completion. If a goal is not specific, it will be harder to tell when it is reached. It will also decrease the ability to gauge how far along someone is to complete a goal.

It is important to make sure that there is a metric or other measurement that can be used as a way to see how far someone is into a goal. Goals that can't be measured compound the difficulty of completing a goal.

Goals which are impossible or highly unlikely to be completed should not be gone after because it will waste time and resources on something that can't or most likely won't be completed.

Going for goals which do not align with a person will only make it even harder to complete. Goals should be relevant to the person and for the wanted outcome.

A goal should have a time constraint to limit procrastination and delays. Goals with an unclear end date are much more likely to be pushed back further, potentially to the point where the goal can no longer be completed.</div>
