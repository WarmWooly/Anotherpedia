      <h1>Going out for milk</h1>
      <div>Going out for milk is a meme about family abandonment, typically by the father. The thing the father is getting may vary from milk, such as cigarettes or chocolate. The typical setup is either the child being unaware of the father's permanent milk-getting or the child being upset that his father is getting the milk. Some spin the meme positively with the father actually coming back with the milk.</div>
