Oh...img>>{{bGoing out for milk}} is a [[meme|internet meme]] about [[family abandonment]], typically by the [[father]]. The [[thing]] the father is getting may vary from [[milk]], such as [[cigarettes|Cigarette]] or [[chocolate]]. The typical setup is either the [[child]] being unaware of the father's permanent milk-getting or the child being upset that his father is getting the milk. Some spin the meme positively with the father actually coming back with the milk.</div>
