      <div>Not to be confused with Gold Seal ({{aiBalatro) or Gold Stake (aiBalatro).}}&spA Gold Card is an Enhancement for playing cards in Balatro. When a Gold Card is held in the hand at the end of the round, the player is awarded $3. This effect stacks for every Gold Card in the hand (1 card --> $3, 2 cards --> $6, 3 cards --> $9, ...). The Tarot Card The Devil can be used to turn 1 card into a Gold Card.</div>
