      <h1>Gold Seal (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Gold Stake ({{aiBalatro) or Gold Card (aiBalatro).}}&spA Gold Seal is a Seal for playing cards in Balatro. When a Gold Seal is scored, the player is awarded $3. This effect stacks for every Gold Card scored in a poker hand (1 card --> $3, 2 cards --> $6, 3 cards --> $9, ...). Gold Seal can be obtained through the Spectral Card Talisman or on cards randomly created in booster packs or the Shop.</div>
