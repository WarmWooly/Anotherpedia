      <h1>Goo (Inanimate Insanity)</h1>
      <div>Goo is a fictional character in the web series Inanimate Insanity who appears in the third season for Inanimate Insanity Invitational. He is voiced by Justin Chapman.

It is not fully clear what Goo is, seeming to be a sort of slime. It has a pair of dot eyes and eyebrows (only shown when being expressive), alongside a large mouth with two sets of solid teeth and a tongue. Its body seems to conform to a rotund shape with a flattened bottom, suggesting that the darker inside is keeping Goo's shape. He has the power to inflate, which was used to cushion the fall of another contestant.

Goo, also known as The Fluid, Goo Guy, and Goo Goo Gaga, is an optimist who enjoys making others happy. He attempts to talk to other contestants often, rambling on and on with analogies that are often profound or unusual. He claims that they just don't "stick". He is even willing to fail challenges in order to cheer someone up.<br><br>Goo has also been seen to have symptoms similar to anxiety, fearing that his communication difficulties, odd appearance, and other traits would cause him to be ostracized by others.<br><br>Goo enjoys pinecones.

Taylor Gordin, a major part of the Inanimate Insanity team, confirmed that Goo is a reference to the Pokémon Goomy.<br><br>Goo is revealed to be good at counting.<br><br>Goo is the first contestant to use the confessional.</div>
