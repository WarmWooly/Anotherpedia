      <h1>Goo Goo Cluster</h1>
      <div>Goo Goo Cluster is an American candy bar which was created in 1912 by Howard Campbell from the Standard Candy Company in Nashville, Tennessee. The bar consists of marshmallow, caramel, and roasted peanuts covered in chocolate. Variations include the Goo Goo Pecan (with pecans instead of peanuts, which was renamed from Goo Goo Supreme) and Peanut Butter Goo Goo (with a peanut butter filling instead of marshmallows and caramel).</div>
