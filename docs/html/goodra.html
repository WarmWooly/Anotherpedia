      <h1>Goodra</h1>
      <div>Goodra is a snail-like Dragon type Pokémon from the sixth generation. Goodra is considered a Pseudo-legendary Pokémon.

Goodra resembles a dragon with a pair of large green eyes while being constantly coated in a thick layer of pale green slime. The majority of Goodra's body is a light purple, where it has a deeper purple underside. It has two green spots on each of its cheeks, alongside three on its curled tail on each side. It has a small snout and two pairs of flexible horns, with the front two much shorter than the back two, with the tips slightly curled. It has stubby arms and legs, only having two fingers and toes respectively. Goo is constantly dripping from its chin and arms.<br><br>Goodra's official size is 6 ft, 7 in, while weighing 331.8 lbs. Shiny Goodras have a yellow body, an orange underside, and purple spots instead of light/dark purple and green respectively, alongside purple eyes and goo.<br><br>It is almost certain that Goodra's name is a portmanteau of goo and dragon.

Goodra is considered friendly, hugging ones that it enjoys, covering them in ooze. It is also teased for being weak. When left alone, Goodra cries tears of goo. Goodra is able to swim at great speeds through water. Goodra has difficulty listening to instructions, becoming bewildered. When enraged, it will become an unstoppable force to be reckoned with. Its horns can hit 100 times as hard as a heavyweight boxer, or roughly 75000 lbs-bf (which is instantly lethal), while also being able to throw a decent punch. Physical attacks against it, however, slide off, negating blunt strikes.

A Goodra has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Goodra is the 706th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color purple.<br><br>Goodra evolves from Sliggoo at level 50 during rain or fog, which evolves from at level 40 Goomy. Hisuian Goodra evolves from Hisuian Sliggoo. Goodra's leveling rate is "Slow".

Hisuian Goodra is both Dragon type and Steel type. Goodra has silver-colored eyes, spots, and goo, alongside a hunchback due to the weight of the large steel shell its tail curls into. It also has thinner, yet longer, horns. It only has one spot per cheek and two spots on each side of its tail. Its shiny form has gold eyes, spots, and goo, alongside a bronze shell, with the rest of the coloring unchanged. Goodra will rarely leave its shell, with the ability to change how hard it is at will. It is very clingy and will get utterly vexed when left alone. Hisuian Goodra official size is 5 ft, 7 in, while weighing 736.6 lbs.</div>
