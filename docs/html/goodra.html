  <h1>Goodra</h1>
  <div><<short706th Dragon type Pokémonshort>><<img(src=git/goodra.png(cap=Goodra.img>>{{bGoodra}} is a [[snail]]-like [[Dragon type|dragon type (pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] from the [[sixth generation|Generation VI (Pokémon)]]. Goodra is considered a [[Pseudo-legendary Pokémon]].<<hrAppearance and naminghr>>Goodra resembles a [[dragon]] with a pair of large green eyes while being constantly coated in a thick layer of pale green [[slime]]. The majority of Goodra's body is a light purple, where it has a deeper purple underside. It has two green spots on each of its cheeks, alongside three on its curled tail on each side. It has a small snout and two pairs of flexible horns, with the front two much shorter than the back two, with the tips slightly curled. It has stubby arms and legs, only having two fingers and toes respectively. [[Goo]] is constantly dripping from its chin and arms.&pGoodra's official size is 6 [[ft|foot (unit)]], 7 [[in|inch]], while weighing 331.8 [[lbs|Pound]]. [[Shiny|Shiny (Pokémon)]] Goodras have a yellow body, an orange underside, and purple spots instead of light/dark purple and green respectively, alongside purple eyes and goo.&pIt is almost certain that Goodra's name is a [[portmanteau]] of {{igoo}} and {{idragon}}.<<hrBehaviorhr>><<img(src=git/goodra rain.gif(cap=Goodra standing in the [[rain]] next to a [[Pikachu|Pikachu (pokémon)]].img>>Goodra is considered friendly, hugging ones that it enjoys, covering them in ooze. It is also [[teased|teasing]] for being [[weak]]. When left alone, Goodra cries tears of goo. Goodra is able to swim at great speeds through [[water]]. Goodra has difficulty listening to instructions, becoming [[bewildered]]. When [[enraged]], it will become an unstoppable force to be reckoned with. Its horns can hit 100 times as hard as a heavyweight [[boxer]], or roughly 75000 [[lb{{s-bf}}|pound-force]] (which is instantly [[lethal]]), while also being able to throw a decent punch. Physical attacks against it, however, slide off, negating blunt strikes.<<hrGame mechanicshr>>A Goodra has a 50/50 chance to be [[male]] or [[female]]. Goodra is the 706th Pokémon in the [[Pokédex|Pokédex (Pokémon)]] and has the Pokédex color purple.&pGoodra [[evolves|evolution (pokémon)]] from [[Sliggoo|sliggoo (pokémon)]] at level 50 during rain or fog, which evolves from at level 40 [[Goomy|Goomy (Pokémon)]]. Hisuian Goodra evolves from Hisuian Sliggoo. Goodra's leveling rate is "Slow".<<hrHisuian formhr>><<img(src=git/hisuian goodra.png(cap=The Hisuain form of Goodra.img>>Hisuian Goodra is both Dragon type and [[Steel type|steel type (pokémon)]]. Goodra has silver-colored eyes, spots, and goo, alongside a hunchback due to the weight of the large steel [[shell]] its tail curls into. It also has thinner, yet longer, horns. It only has one spot per cheek and two spots on each side of its tail. Its shiny form has gold eyes, spots, and goo, alongside a bronze shell, with the rest of the coloring unchanged. Goodra will rarely leave its shell, with the ability to change how hard it is at will. It is very [[clingy]] and will get utterly [[vexed]] when left alone. Hisuian Goodra official size is 5 [[ft|foot (unit)]], 7 [[in|inch]], while weighing 736.6 [[lbs|Pound]].</div>
