      <h1>Googledebunker</h1>
      <div>A Googledebunker or Google debunker is a slang term for people who use Google Search to find information, especially on topics they may be unfamiliar with, when debunking another person. The term was popularized by the archaeologist YouTuber Miniminuteman (Milo Rossi) in a two-part video series discussing and debunking the TikTokker/YouTuber Filip Zieba, making fun of Filip's use of "Googledebunker" to describe people who don't agree with his alternative theories. Googledebunker has since been used to criticize conspiracy theorists and as a joke, such as "I'm going Googledebunkers!" when someone gets mad at a theorist.</div>
