      <h1>Goomy</h1>
      <div>Goomy is a slime (fictional creature)-like blob dragon type (pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation VI (Pokémon).

For more images, see Gallery of Goomy.<br>Goomy resembles a slug or a slime with a pair of dot black eyes. It has a lower, darker portion and an upper, lighter portion separated by the wiggly line for the mouth. There are five green spots in between the two sections, with the front two being the edges of its mouth. It has a pair of antenna-like horns, short in the front, and long in the back, used for navigation. It may be related to blue dragon.<br><br>Goomy's official size is 1 foot (unit), while weighing 6.3 Pound. shiny (pokémon) Goomies have a yellow top, an orange bottom, and purple spots instead of light/dark purple and green respectively.<br><br>It is likely that Goomy is a portmanteau of goo and slimy.

Goomy is often seen eating leaf as its primary source of food. Mostly comprised of water, Goomy is able to dry out in arid conditions, killing it. Goomy is covered in a slimy membrane that prevents physical attacks from making a direct strike, greatly weakening blunt attacks.

A Goomy has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Goomy is the 704th Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color purple.<br><br>At leveling (pokémon) 40, Goomy evolves into Sliggoo (pokémon), and at level 50 during rain or fog, Goodra (pokémon). When evolved in Hisui (pokémon), the evolutions are the Hisuian forms of Sliggoo and Goodra respectively. Goomy's leveling rate is "Slow".</div>
