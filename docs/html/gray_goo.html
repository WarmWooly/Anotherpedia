      <h1>Gray goo</h1>
      <div>This is often confused for the video game of a similar name, {{aiGrey Goo (game).}}<br>Gray goo is a fictional nanomachine often used in science fiction relating to the idea of a self-replicating nanobots. Gray goo is only theoretical, where it uses all available matter to create more of itself, usually uncontrolled. This creates a massive swarm that destroys all that stands in its way, which can cause the end of the world.</div>
