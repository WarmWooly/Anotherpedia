      <h1>Green boss monster (CircleToonsHD)</h1>
      <div>The green boss monster is an insert for a generic boss within Elden Ring created by CircleToonsHD for his animations. The monster appears in two YouTube videos, "When You Refuse to Use Resources in an RPG" and "How One Item Fractured Elden Ring's Fanbase". The monster is also voiced by CircleToonsHD.

The green boss monster is light green and is very round in shape. It has stubby arms and legs attached to its torso and a sauropod-like head and neck. Its eyes are fully black and it has a white tongue. The monster sports a pair of cyan wing-like appendages on its back that are not shown to have a purpose besides appearance. It wields a morning star with four spikes in its right arm. The center ball of the morning star is orange, with the color of the handle and spikes being either purple or gray based on the video it appears in.

The first video the monster appears in is the YouTube short "When You Refuse to Use Resources in an RPG", uploaded on July 13, 2024. In the video, the monster stomps on a person wearing armor and a cape, proceeding to laugh "HUHAHAHA" before swinging left to right going "BLRBLHRB" as if to mock the person. The short then proceeds to have a player complain that the boss is too hard, continuing from there.<br><br>The second video the monster appears in is the YouTube video "How One Item Fractured Elden Ring's Fanbase", uploaded on September 21, 2024. While CircleToonsHD describes how he feels that the $40 DLC for Elden Ring, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, would be pointless if players could easily defeat all the new monsters with high-leveled characters, a person with armor, a hat and cloak made from a wolf, and a large sword walks up to the monster. The person with a single slice cleaves the monster, causing its top half to slide to the ground while going expressionless.</div>
