      <h1>Griddy</h1>
      <div>The Griddy is a dance created by Davis Allen. The name came from Allen's nickname, Griddy.

To do the Griddy, the dancer first taps their heels against the ground while moving forward. The movement of the foot should be minute, and between each heel tap should be a bit of air time. Their head and body are slightly arched downward during the motion. They then swing their arms from behind them and in front of the middle of their chest repeatedly.

The most common variation is for the dancer to look through their hands as if they were glasses. They press their index finger and their thumb together while extending the rest of their fingers. During the swinging motion, instead of going to the center of the chest, their hands come up to their face around their eyes. Another change that many do is to use their toes instead of their heels, adding more bounce and speed while sacrificing difficulty and finesse.<br><br>One of the most iconic variations was the one performed by Blippi (character), where he bobs his head side to side while hopping left to right with both his feet together.</div>
