      <h1>Gun spawning (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Gun spawning is the mechanic for several modes to generate guns into a map for the player to use. Guns will typically fall from the sky near the center of the map, incentivizing players to run towards the center and grab what they can while fighting others. All guns (besides the Basic Gun) will spawn based on that gun's spawn rate. The spawn rate is used to balance out more powerful guns by making it less likely to appear. Maps where guns can easily fall off, such as Tower and Highway, have an increased spawn rate to compensate. The mode Gun Rain greatly increases the spawn rate of guns.</div>
