      <h1>Gun spawning ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
      <div><<shortMechanic for gun generation in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/gun spawning laser fight.png(cap=Spawned guns in the map [[Spleef|Spleef (Laser Fight)]].img>>{{bGun spawning}} is the mechanic for several [[modes|mode (Laser Fight)]] to generate [[guns|gun (Laser Fight)]] into a [[map|map (Laser Fight)]] for the player to use. Guns will typically fall from the sky near the center of the map, incentivizing players to run towards the center and grab what they can while fighting others. All guns (besides the [[Basic Gun|Basic Gun (Laser Fight)]]) will spawn based on that gun's spawn rate. The spawn rate is used to balance out more powerful guns by making it less likely to appear. Maps where guns can easily fall off, such as [[Tower|Tower (Laser Fight)]] and [[Highway|Highway (Laser Fight)]], have an increased spawn rate to compensate. The mode [[Gun Rain|Gun Rain (Laser Fight)]] greatly increases the spawn rate of guns.</div>
