      <h1>Gun spawning (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Gun spawning is the mechanic for several mode (Laser Fight) to generate gun (Laser Fight) into a map (Laser Fight) for the player to use. Guns will typically fall from the sky near the center of the map, incentivizing players to run towards the center and grab what they can while fighting others. All guns (besides the Basic Gun (Laser Fight)) will spawn based on that gun's spawn rate. The spawn rate is used to balance out more powerful guns by making it less likely to appear. Maps where guns can easily fall off, such as Tower (Laser Fight) and Highway (Laser Fight), have an increased spawn rate to compensate. The mode Gun Rain (Laser Fight) greatly increases the spawn rate of guns.</div>
