      <h1>Hallucination (artificial intelligence)</h1>
      <div>For psychosis caused by AI, see Chatbot psychosis.<br>A hallucination within artificial intelligence is misinformation or incorrect information presented as fact. This may be caused by overfitting (machine learning) training data, bias within training data, and/or a high complexity within the model. The effects of hallucinations include minor deviations from reality to entirely fiction events or people. Hallucinations can appear in any AI, but are most prominent within chatbot or Artificial intelligence visual art.</div>
