The hand size will also determine how many cards can be displayed when opening a [[Tarot|Tarot Cards (Balatro)]] or [[Spectral|Spectral Cards (Balatro)]] [[Pack|Booster Packs (Balatro)]]. The normal hand size is set to 8. Larger hands are often beneficial as they can make it more likely to draw cards for larger [[hand types|Poker hand (Balatro)]] and can hold more cards with held-in-hand effects (ex. [[Steel Card|Steel Card (Balatro)]], [[Blue Seal|Blue Seal (Balatro)]]). Hand size does not limit the maximum amount of cards that can be held in the hand. Besides in [[The Serpent|The Serpent (Balatro)]] [[Boss Blind|Boss Blinds (Balatro)]], after every played poker hand, cards from the [[deck|deck (Balatro)]] will be drawn until the hand is full or the deck runs out of cards.<<hrHow to changehr>>There are plenty of things that affect hand size, including [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]], [[Tags|Tags (Balatro)]], [[Boss Blinds|Boss Blinds (Balatro)]], [[Decks|Decks (Balatro)]], [[Challenges|Challenges (Balatro)]], [[Vouchers|Vouchers (Balatro)]], and [[Spectral Cards|Spectral Cards (Balatro)]].
