      <h1>Hand size (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Hand size is a value used to determine the amount of playing cards that can be drawn into the hand in Balatro. The hand size will also determine how many cards can be displayed when opening a Tarot or Spectral Pack. The normal hand size is set to 8. Larger hands are often beneficial as they can make it more likely to draw cards for larger hand types and can hold more cards with held-in-hand effects (ex. Steel Card, Blue Seal). Hand size does not limit the maximum amount of cards that can be held in the hand. Besides in The Serpent Boss Blind, after every played poker hand, cards from the deck will be drawn until the hand is full or the deck runs out of cards.

There are plenty of things that affect hand size, including Jokers, Tags, Boss Blinds, Decks, Challenges, Vouchers, and Spectral Cards. The following are all ways the hand size can be changed:<<tableName|Type|Effect||Turtle Bean|Joker|+5 hand size, reduces by 1 every round||Juggler|Joker|+1 hand size||Troubadour|Joker|+2 hand size, -1 hand||Merry Andy|Joker|+3 discards, -1 hand size||Stuntman|Joker|+250 chips, -2 hand size||Painted Deck|Deck|+2 hand size, -1 Joker slot||Luxury Tax|Challenge|+2 hand size, -1 hand size per $5||Five-Card Draw|Challenge|-3 hand size||Paint Brush|Voucher|+1 hand size||Palette|Voucher|+1 hand size||Ouija|Spectral Card|Turns all cards in hand into the same random Rank and -1 hand size||Ectoplasm|Spectral Card|Adds Negative to a random Joker and -1 hand size; hand reduction stacks per Ectoplasm (1 card → -1 size, 2 cards → -2 size, 3 cards → -3 size)||Juggle Tag|Tag|+3 hand size for the next round||The Manacle|Boss Blind|-1 hand sizetable>></div>
