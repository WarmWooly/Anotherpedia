  <h1>Harry Potter Obama Sonic Backpack</h1>
  <div><<short2009--10 bootleg backpackshort>><<img(src=git/harry potter obama sonic.png(cap=The backpack.img>>The {{bHarry Potter Obama Sonic Backpack}} is a black [[backpack]] with the words "[[Harry Potter|Harry Potter (character)]]" and "[[Obama|Barack Obama]]", the character [[Sonic|Sonic the Hedgehog (character)]] with a "10" on his chest, and a pair of red [[tulips|tulip]]. While the [[origins|image origin]] of the backpack is unknown, the image surfaced around 2009--10 online and has since become a [[meme|internet meme]] due to its absurdity. The backpack seems to be a [[bootleg]], taking elements from the {{i[[Harry Potter]]}} and {{i[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]}} franchises and the last name of the then-[[president of the United States]] Barack Obama. The other elements, the number 10 and the tulips, add to the strange elements of the backpack. There has been no physical confirmation of its existence, and only a single image of the backpack is known to exist.</div>
