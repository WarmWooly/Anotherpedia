  <h1>Harry Potter Obama Sonic Backpack</h1>
  <div>The {{bHarry Potter Obama Sonic Backpack}} is a black backpack with the words "Harry Potter (character)" and "Barack Obama", the character Sonic the Hedgehog (character) with a "10" on his chest, and a pair of red tulip. While the image origin of the backpack is unknown, the image surfaced around 2009--10 online and has since become a internet meme due to its absurdity. The backpack seems to be a bootleg, taking elements from the {{iHarry Potter}} and {{iSonic the Hedgehog}} franchises and the last name of the then-president of the United States Barack Obama. The other elements, the number 10 and the tulips, add to the strange elements of the backpack. There has been no physical confirmation of its existence, and only a single image of the backpack is known to exist.</div>
