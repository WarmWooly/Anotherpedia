      <h1>Harry Potter Obama Sonic Backpack</h1>
      <div>The Harry Potter Obama Sonic Backpack is a black backpack with the words "Harry Potter" and "Obama", the character Sonic with a "10" on his chest, and a pair of red tulips. While the origins of the backpack is unknown, the image surfaced around 2009--10 online and has since become a meme due to its absurdity. The backpack seems to be a bootleg, taking elements from the Harry Potter and Sonic the Hedgehog franchises and the last name of the then-president of the United States Barack Obama. The other elements, the number 10 and the tulips, add to the strange elements of the backpack. There has been no physical confirmation of its existence, and only a single image of the backpack is known to exist.</div>
