      <h1>Headlight fluid</h1>
      <div>Headlight fluid is a fake fluid made to joke or swindle people who are car illiterate, as there is no need to apply fluids to a car headlight. Other similar names include "blinker fluid", "headlight repair fluid", or "headlight restore". Headlight fluid is often claimed to increase or restore the brightness of headlights. While headlight fluid itself may not be real, headlight restoration kit are used to defog old headlights. It has since been turned into a gag gift in the form of a bottle or container labeled "headlight fluid" used to make a fool out of people who don't know that headlight fluid isn't real.</div>
