      <h1>Headphones</h1>
      <div>Headphones are a pair of earphones with a band connecting the phones, which is also used to rest against the head. It can be used to listen to audio files and/or be connected to electronic devices. Headphones are often used to listen to music or other speech, such as in videos, especially to prevent others from being forced to listen. Many headphones are attached to an AUX cable, but others connect using Bluetooth.</div>
