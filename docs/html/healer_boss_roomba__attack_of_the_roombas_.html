      <div><<info||Stats||Health|40 HP||Speed|250%||Size|138%||Min.<br>Kills|75 killsinfo>>The Healer Boss Roomba is a boss enemy in Attack of the Roombas, having the ability to slowly heal HP over time. Every 2.67 seconds, the Healer Boss Roomba will heal 1 HP if damaged. The Healer Boss Roomba will only appear once, and upon defeating it, will grant the player an increased camera view, an increased movement speed, and a decreased reload time. To prevent an infinite score farm, each time the Healer Boss Roomba heals, 1 score is removed.</div>
