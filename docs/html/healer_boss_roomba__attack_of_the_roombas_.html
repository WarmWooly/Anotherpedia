Every 2.67 seconds, the Healer Boss Roomba will heal 1 HP if damaged. The Healer Boss Roomba will only appear once, and upon defeating it, will grant the [[player|player (Attack of the Roombas)]] an increased camera view, an increased movement speed, and a decreased reload time. To prevent an infinite score farm, each time the Healer Boss Roomba heals, 1 score is removed.</div>
