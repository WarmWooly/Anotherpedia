      <h1>Heat Capacity (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>Heat Capacity is a characteristic of liquid (Mindustry) in Mindustry formerly used to determine how fast a liquid would be used as a coolant in the Thorium Reactor (Mindustry), but <<asofversions (Mindustry) 7.0 (Mindustry)>>, is used to determine the benefit to turret (Mindustry) fire rate. The following table shows the Heat Capacity of all liquids in Mindustry:<<tableLiquid|Heat Capacity||Water (Mindustry)|r40%||Slag (Mindustry)|r50%||Oil (Mindustry)|r70%||Cryofluid (Mindustry)|r90%||Neoplasm (Mindustry)|r40%||Arkycite (Mindustry)|r50%||Ozone (Mindustry)|r50%||Hydrogen (Mindustry)|r50%||Nitrogen (Mindustry)|r50%||Cyanogen (Mindustry)|r50%table>><br>Both turrets on Serpulo (Mindustry) and Erekir (Mindustry) can use liquid cooling. Only Water and Cryofluid can be used for cooling, so Heat Capacity in other liquids is meaningless. Cryofluid is unavailable on Erekir, so Erekir turrets cannot be cooled through Cryofluid. The following is a table listing each turret and the boost they gain to fire rate with Water and Cryofluid:<<tableTurret|Water|Cryofluid|Rate||Duo (Mindustry)|r120%|r145%|r6/sec||Scatter (Mindustry)|r140%|r190%|r12/sec||Scorch (Mindustry)|r106%|r113.5%|r6/sec||Hail (Mindustry)|r120%|r145%|r6/sec||Lancer (Mindustry)|r140%|r190%|r12/sec||Arc (Mindustry)|r120%|r145%|r6/sec||Swarmer (Mindustry)|r160%|r235%|r18/sec||Salvo (Mindustry)|r140%|r190%|r12/sec||Fuse (Mindustry)|r160%|r235%|r18/sec||Ripple (Mindustry)|r160%|r235%|r18/sec||Cyclone (Mindustry)|r160%|r235%|r18/sec||Foreshadow (Mindustry)|r116%|r136%|r60/sec||Spectre (Mindustry)|r120%|r145%|r60/sec||Meltdown (Mindustry)|r100%|r225%|r30/sec||Breach (Mindustry)|r160%|c-|r15/sec||Diffuse (Mindustry)|r160%|c-|r15/sec||Titan (Mindustry)|r130%|c-|r30/sec||Disperse (Mindustry)|r133.33%|c-|r20/sec||Scathe (Mindustry)|r160%|c-|r15/sec||Smite (Mindustry)|r160%|c-|r15/sectable>></div>
