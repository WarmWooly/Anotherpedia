  <h1>Heat Capacity (Mindustry)</h1>
  <div><<shortCharactaristic of turret fire rate boosting in {{iMindustry}}short>><<img(src=git/mindustry heat capacity.gif(cap=The Water-cooled Duo (top) is firing slower than the Cryofluid-cooled Duo (bottom).img>>{{bHeat Capacity}} is a characteristic of [[liquids|liquid (Mindustry)]] in {{i[[Mindustry]]}} formerly used to determine how fast a liquid would be used as a coolant in the [[Thorium Reactor|Thorium Reactor (Mindustry)]], but <<asof[[version|versions (Mindustry)]] [[7.0|7.0 (Mindustry)]]>>, is used to determine the benefit to [[turrets'|turret (Mindustry)]] fire rate. The following table shows the Heat Capacity of all liquids in {{iMindustry}}:<<table{{bLiquid}}|{{bHeat Capacity}}||[[Water|Water (Mindustry)]]|{{r40%}}||[[Slag|Slag (Mindustry)]]|{{r50%}}||[[Oil|Oil (Mindustry)]]|{{r70%}}||[[Cryofluid|Cryofluid (Mindustry)]]|{{r90%}}||[[Neoplasm|Neoplasm (Mindustry)]]|{{r40%}}||[[Arkycite|Arkycite (Mindustry)]]|{{r50%}}||[[Ozone|Ozone (Mindustry)]]|{{r50%}}||[[Hydrogen|Hydrogen (Mindustry)]]|{{r50%}}||[[Nitrogen|Nitrogen (Mindustry)]]|{{r50%}}||[[Cyanogen|Cyanogen (Mindustry)]]|{{r50%}}table>>&spBoth turrets on [[Serpulo|Serpulo (Mindustry)]] and [[Erekir|Erekir (Mindustry)]] can use liquid cooling. Only Water and Cryofluid can be used for cooling, so Heat Capacity in other liquids is meaningless. Cryofluid is unavailable on Erekir, so Erekir turrets cannot be cooled through Cryofluid. The following is a table listing each turret and the boost they gain to fire rate with Water and Cryofluid:<<table{{bTurret}}|{{bWater}}|{{bCryofluid}}|{{bRate}}||[[Duo|Duo (Mindustry)]]|{{r120%}}|{{r145%}}|{{r6/sec}}||[[Scatter|Scatter (Mindustry)]]|{{r140%}}|{{r190%}}|{{r12/sec}}||[[Scorch|Scorch (Mindustry)]]|{{r106%}}|{{r113.5%}}|{{r6/sec}}||[[Hail|Hail (Mindustry)]]|{{r120%}}|{{r145%}}|{{r6/sec}}||[[Lancer|Lancer (Mindustry)]]|{{r140%}}|{{r190%}}|{{r12/sec}}||[[Arc|Arc (Mindustry)]]|{{r120%}}|{{r145%}}|{{r6/sec}}||[[Swarmer|Swarmer (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{r235%}}|{{r18/sec}}||[[Salvo|Salvo (Mindustry)]]|{{r140%}}|{{r190%}}|{{r12/sec}}||[[Fuse|Fuse (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{r235%}}|{{r18/sec}}||[[Ripple|Ripple (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{r235%}}|{{r18/sec}}||[[Cyclone|Cyclone (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{r235%}}|{{r18/sec}}||[[Foreshadow|Foreshadow (Mindustry)]]|{{r116%}}|{{r136%}}|{{r60/sec}}||[[Spectre|Spectre (Mindustry)]]|{{r120%}}|{{r145%}}|{{r60/sec}}||[[Meltdown|Meltdown (Mindustry)]]<<note(content=Unlike other turrets where the additional boost is based on the Heat Capacity, the Meltdown's total fire rate is influenced by the Heat Capacity.(text=noteCountnote>>|{{r100%}}|{{r225%}}|{{r30/sec}}||[[Breach|Breach (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{c-}}|{{r15/sec}}||[[Diffuse|Diffuse (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{c-}}|{{r15/sec}}||[[Titan|Titan (Mindustry)]]|{{r130%}}|{{c-}}|{{r30/sec}}||[[Disperse|Disperse (Mindustry)]]|{{r133.33%}}|{{c-}}|{{r20/sec}}||[[Scathe|Scathe (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{c-}}|{{r15/sec}}||[[Smite|Smite (Mindustry)]]|{{r160%}}|{{c-}}|{{r15/sec}}table>></div>
