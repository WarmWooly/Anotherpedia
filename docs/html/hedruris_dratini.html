Scale bar: 500 µm."img>>{{b{{iHedruris dratini}}}} or {{i{{bH. dratini}}}} is a [[species]] of {{i[[Hedruris]]}} which is a [[parasitic|parasite]] [[nematode]] in [[Argentina]] who uses the [[Argentine snake-necked turtle]] and the [[Hilaire's toad-headed turtle]] as its [[host|parasitic host]] and [[amphipods|amphipod]] as an [[intermediary host]]. {{iH. dratini}} was [[discovered|species discovery]] and published to the [[Journal of Helminthology]] on October 4, 2019, titled "[[A new species of {{iHedruris}} (Nematoda: Hedruridae) from freshwater turtles, its life cycle and biogeographic distribution of the genus]]," whose [[lead author]] was [[Ezequiel Palumbo]].<<hrEtymologyhr>>The [[etymology]] of {{iH. dratini}} is a [[latin binomial]] of the [[family|family (biology)]] and what is described to be an [[arbitrary]] combination of {{i[[dragon]]}} ({{idra}}) and {{i[[tiny]]}} ({{itini}}). However, in a post on [[Twitter]], the official Journal of Helminthology account states that {{iHedruris dratini}} is named after the [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] [[Dratini]].<<hrFollow-up researchhr>>Following "A new species of {{iHedruris}} (Nematoda: Hedruridae) from freshwater turtles, its life cycle and biogeographic distribution of the genus," Ezeqiel Palumbo alongside [[María Julia Cassano]], [[Leandro Alcalde]], and [[Julia Inés Diaz]] wrote the paper "[[Seasonal variation of {{iHedruris dratini}} (Nematoda) parasitizing {{iHydromedusa tectifera}} (Chelidae), with focus on host’s torpor state]]," which was published on May 1, 2021 to [[BMC Zoology]]. This follow-up found an increase in {{iH. dratini}} during the [[summer]] and decrease during the [[winter]], and that their [[life cycle]] remains in motion regardless of [[season]].</div>
