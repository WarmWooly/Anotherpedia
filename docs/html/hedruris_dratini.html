      <h1>Hedruris dratini</h1>
      <div>Hedruris dratini or H. dratini is a species of Hedruris which is a parasitic nematode in Argentina who uses the Argentine snake-necked turtle and the Hilaire's toad-headed turtle as its host and amphipods as an intermediary host. H. dratini was discovered and published to the Journal of Helminthology on October 4, 2019, titled "A new species of Hedruris (Nematoda: Hedruridae) from freshwater turtles, its life cycle and biogeographic distribution of the genus," whose lead author was Ezequiel Palumbo.

The etymology of H. dratini is a latin binomial of the family and what is described to be an arbitrary combination of dragon (dra) and tiny (tini). However, in a post on Twitter, the official Journal of Helminthology account states that Hedruris dratini is named after the Pokémon Dratini.

Following "A new species of Hedruris (Nematoda: Hedruridae) from freshwater turtles, its life cycle and biogeographic distribution of the genus," Ezeqiel Palumbo alongside María Julia Cassano, Leandro Alcalde, and Julia Inés Diaz wrote the paper "Seasonal variation of Hedruris dratini (Nematoda) parasitizing Hydromedusa tectifera (Chelidae), with focus on host’s torpor state," which was published on May 1, 2021 to BMC Zoology. This follow-up found an increase in H. dratini during the summer and decrease during the winter, and that their life cycle remains in motion regardless of season.</div>
