      <h1>Hexagonal water</h1>
      <div>For the organization, see Hexagonal Water (organization).<br>Hexagonal water, also known as gel water or cluster water, is a marketing scam for the chemical hydroxide hydrate, with the chemical formula of Hs-b3Os-b2s-p-. Due to the "scientific" nature of water, this pseudoscience looks legitimate to gullible people.

The hexagonal water is said to form a star tetrahedron in the body, which is the most efficient way for water to store information (aka water memory). It is claimed that it is better than water because it can be an antioxidant, detoxification agent, and a boost for the immune system, alongside skin health and vitality.</div>
