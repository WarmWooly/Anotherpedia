      <h1>Hexaria</h1>
      <div>For the puzzle game by Auroriax, see {{aiHexaria (Auroriax).}}<br>{{iHexaria}} is a card video game MMORPG on Roblox developed by Bitsquid Games. Players build up deck (Hexaria) containing various card (Hexaria) to combat (Hexaria) enemies or PvP (Hexaria) on a hexagonal grid. Players fight enemies in order to get more cards or Gold (Hexaria)/items to obtain more cards, often allowing strategies and synergies to be formed. Hexaria is comprised of many public and private Roblox server between areas of the game, creating a sense of distance between unique places and allowing private raid (Hexaria) for both solo players and party (Hexaria).



Main page: Locations ({{aiHexaria)}}<br>Exploration is a key element of Hexaria, where players are encouraged to explore different regions and dimensions to fight stronger and unique enemies alongside gaining unique rewards. Hexaria (Hexaria) is the main dimensions (Hexaria) of Hexaria, with players starting in Cambris (Hexaria). Cambris is a large, grassy, mountainous portion of Hexaria that contains various factions and quests for the player to complete through low-level enemies. Olbrek (Hexaria) is the second major nation that players explore, containing many denominations of magic with their own unique card sets and abilities. Other nations, such as Arcovia (Hexaria), and dimensions, such as Kishuf (Hexaria) and the Nether (Hexaria), can be explored later on with stronger enemies and valuable, powerful cards. There are also raids, where players can enter by themselves or with a party to take on private challenges and fight bosses (Hexaria) for some of the most powerful cards in the game. During holiday or other unique events, additional locations may appear with limited-time cards and reskin (Hexaria).

Main page: Card ({{aiHexaria)}}<br>There are hundreds of cards within Hexaria that can be used during combat, falling into 6 categories: attack card (Hexaria) (red background), healing card (Hexaria) (green background), effect (Hexaria) (blue background), buff card (Hexaria) (yellow background), trap card (Hexaria) (purple background), or field card (Hexaria) (orange background). Attack cards deal damage (Hexaria) to a target, which can have a range, Area of Effect (Hexaria), additional effects, or bonuses based on the situation. Healing cards increase health (Hexaria) or apply regenerative effect (Hexaria) onto a target (including self), often with stipulations, range, and/or an AOE. Effect cards are the broadest category, applying status effects, summon card (Hexaria) allies, drawing and redrawing cards, gaining Bit (Hexaria), and other effects. Buff cards apply attack buff (Hexaria) and defense buff (Hexaria) or attack debuff (Hexaria) and defense debuff (Hexaria) to targets alongside other attack/defense-related effects. Trap cards place an object onto the field that triggers when an enemy stands on or walks over it, often dealing damage, applying a negative effect, or even summoning allies. Lastly, field cards apply an effect to the entire battlefield over a duration. Cards also come in 4 card rarity (Hexaria): common (grey border), rare (white border), ultra-rare (yellow border), and legendary (cyan border). Rarities determine how many copies of a card can be in a deck (including reskins), starting at 4 copies for commons down to 1 copy for legendaries. Many cards are unobtainable card (Hexaria), either being NPC-exclusive or no longer having the obtainment method available to players.

Main page: Combat ({{aiHexaria)}}<br>Combat is the core mechanic behind Hexaria, where a player uses their cards to defeat enemies or other players for rewards or valor. Combat is turn-based combat, where each turn, the players and enemies each get a chance to take their actions. Entities have many stats, including health, max health, Bits, status effects, buffs and debuffs, their deck, their hand (Hexaria), and their discard pile (Hexaria). At the start of a turn, a player/entity gains a Bit, with various effects increasing/decreasing earned and max Bits, which are used to play most cards. Standard players and entities can move up to 2 tiles away and play a card. Some cards are quickplay (Hexaria), which means they can be played mid-turn without ending it. Every turn for players lasts 30 seconds in most cases, where if a player hasn't selected an option, they will automatically skip their turn. At the end of a turn, all damage/healing effects trigger. Traps triggered will immediately deal damage/effects mid-turn. A battle ends when all players die (not including summoned allies) or when all enemies die. A battle can have up to 4 players in most cases, with enemies/allies only limited by the size of the battle area.</div>
