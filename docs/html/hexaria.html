  <div><<shortHexagonal card-based Roblox MMORPGshort>>{{tFor the [[puzzle game]] by [[Auroriax]], see [[{{aiHexaria}} (Auroriax)]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/hexaria logo.jpg(cap=The [[logo]] for {{iHexaria}}.img>>{{b{{iHexaria}}}} is a [[card-based|card video game]] [[MMORPG]] on [[Roblox]] developed by [[Bitsquid Games]]. Players build up [[decks|deck (Hexaria)]] containing various [[cards|card (Hexaria)]] to [[fight|combat (Hexaria)]] enemies or [[other players|PvP (Hexaria)]] on a [[hexagonal grid]]. Players fight enemies in order to get more cards or [[Gold|Gold (Hexaria)]]/items to obtain more cards, often allowing strategies and synergies to be formed. {{iHexaria}} is comprised of many public and private [[servers|Roblox server]] between areas of the game, creating a sense of distance between unique places and allowing private [[raids|raid (Hexaria)]] for both solo players and [[parties|party (Hexaria)]].<<hrGameplayhr>><<hr2Explorationhr2>>{{tMain page: [[Locations ({{aiHexaria}})}}]]&sp<<img(src=git/hexaria exploration.png(cap=A part of [[Olbrek Extern 01|Olbrek Extern 01 (Hexaria)]].img>>Exploration is a key element of {{iHexaria}}, where players are encouraged to explore different regions and dimensions to fight stronger and unique enemies alongside gaining unique rewards. [[Hexaria|Hexaria (Hexaria)]] is the main [[dimension|dimensions (Hexaria)]] of {{iHexaria}}, with players starting in [[Cambris|Cambris (Hexaria)]]. Cambris is a large, grassy, mountainous portion of Hexaria that contains various factions and quests for the player to complete through low-level enemies. [[Olbrek|Olbrek (Hexaria)]] is the second major nation that players explore, containing many denominations of magic with their own unique card sets and abilities. Other nations, such as [[Arcovia|Arcovia (Hexaria)]], and dimensions, such as [[Kishuf|Kishuf (Hexaria)]] and the [[Nether|Nether (Hexaria)]], can be explored later on with stronger enemies and valuable, powerful cards. There are also raids, where players can enter by themselves or with a party to take on private challenges and fight [[bosses|bosses (Hexaria)]] for some of the most powerful cards in the game. During [[holidays|holiday]] or other unique events, additional locations may appear with limited-time cards and [[reskins|reskin (Hexaria)]].<<hr2Cardshr2>>{{tMain page: [[Card ({{aiHexaria}})]]}}&sp<<img(src=git/hexaria cards.gif(cap=180 cards in {{iHexaria}}.img>>There are hundreds of cards within {{iHexaria}} that can be used during combat, falling into 6 categories: [[attack|attack card (Hexaria)]] (red background), [[healing|healing card (Hexaria)]] (green background), [[effect|effect (Hexaria)]] (blue background), [[buff|buff card (Hexaria)]] (yellow background), [[trap|trap card (Hexaria)]] (purple background), or [[field|field card (Hexaria)]] (orange background). Attack cards deal [[damage|damage (Hexaria)]] to a target, which can have a range, [[AOE|Area of Effect (Hexaria)]], additional effects, or bonuses based on the situation. Healing cards increase [[health|health (Hexaria)]] or apply regenerative [[effects|effect (Hexaria)]] onto a target (including self), often with stipulations, range, and/or an AOE. Effect cards are the broadest category, applying status effects, [[summoning|summon card (Hexaria)]] allies, drawing and redrawing cards, gaining [[Bits|Bit (Hexaria)]], and other effects. Buff cards apply [[attack|attack buff (Hexaria)]] and [[defense buffs|defense buff (Hexaria)]] or [[attack|attack debuff (Hexaria)]] and [[defense debuffs|defense debuff (Hexaria)]] to targets alongside other attack/defense-related effects. Trap cards place an object onto the field that triggers when an enemy stands on or walks over it, often dealing damage, applying a negative effect, or even summoning allies. Lastly, field cards apply an effect to the entire battlefield over a duration. Cards also come in 4 [[rarities|card rarity (Hexaria)]]: common (grey border), rare (white border), ultra-rare (yellow border), and legendary (cyan border). Rarities determine how many copies of a card can be in a deck (including reskins), starting at 4 copies for commons down to 1 copy for legendaries. Many cards are [[unobtainable|unobtainable card (Hexaria)]], either being NPC-exclusive or no longer having the obtainment method available to players.<<hr2Combathr2>>{{tMain page: [[Combat ({{aiHexaria}})]]}}&sp<<img(src=git/hexaria combat.png(cap=The card [[Burning Pledge|Burning Pledge (Hexaria)]] being used to gain Bits in combat.img>>Combat is the core mechanic behind {{iHexaria}}, where a player uses their cards to defeat enemies or other players for rewards or valor. Combat is [[turn-based|turn-based combat]], where each turn, the players and enemies each get a chance to take their actions. Entities have many stats, including health, max health, Bits, status effects, buffs and debuffs, their deck, their [[hand|hand (Hexaria)]], and their [[discard pile|discard pile (Hexaria)]]. At the start of a turn, a player/entity gains a Bit, with various effects increasing/decreasing earned and max Bits, which are used to play most cards. Standard players and entities can move up to 2 tiles away and play a card. Some cards are [[quickplay|quickplay (Hexaria)]], which means they can be played mid-turn without ending it. Every turn for players lasts 30 seconds in most cases, where if a player hasn't selected an option, they will automatically skip their turn. At the end of a turn, all damage/healing effects trigger. Traps triggered will immediately deal damage/effects mid-turn. A battle ends when all players die (not including summoned allies) or when all enemies die. A battle can have up to 4 players in most cases, with enemies/allies only limited by the size of the battle area.</div>
