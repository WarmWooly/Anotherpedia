      <h1>Hexaria</h1>
      <div>For the puzzle game by Auroriax, see {{aiHexaria (Auroriax).}}<br>{{iHexaria}} is a card-based MMORPG on Roblox developed by Bitsquid Games. Players build up decks containing various cards to fight enemies or other players on a hexagonal grid. Players fight enemies in order to get more cards or Gold/items to obtain more cards, often allowing strategies and synergies to be formed. Hexaria is comprised of many public and private servers between areas of the game, creating a sense of distance between unique places and allowing private raids for both solo players and parties.



Main page: Locations ({{aiHexaria)}}<br>Exploration is a key element of Hexaria, where players are encouraged to explore different regions and dimensions to fight stronger and unique enemies alongside gaining unique rewards. Hexaria is the main dimension of Hexaria, with players starting in Cambris. Cambris is a large, grassy, mountainous portion of Hexaria that contains various factions and quests for the player to complete through low-level enemies. Olbrek is the second major nation that players explore, containing many denominations of magic with their own unique card sets and abilities. Other nations, such as Arcovia, and dimensions, such as Kishuf and the Nether, can be explored later on with stronger enemies and valuable, powerful cards. There are also raids, where players can enter by themselves or with a party to take on private challenges and fight bosses for some of the most powerful cards in the game. During holidays or other unique events, additional locations may appear with limited-time cards and reskins.

Main page: Card ({{aiHexaria)}}<br>There are hundreds of cards within Hexaria that can be used during combat, falling into 6 categories: attack (red background), healing (green background), effect (blue background), buff (yellow background), trap (purple background), or field (orange background). Attack cards deal damage to a target, which can have a range, AOE, additional effects, or bonuses based on the situation. Healing cards increase health or apply regenerative effects onto a target (including self), often with stipulations, range, and/or an AOE. Effect cards are the broadest category, applying status effects, summoning allies, drawing and redrawing cards, gaining Bits, and other effects. Buff cards apply attack and defense buffs or attack and defense debuffs to targets alongside other attack/defense-related effects. Trap cards place an object onto the field that triggers when an enemy stands on or walks over it, often dealing damage, applying a negative effect, or even summoning allies. Lastly, field cards apply an effect to the entire battlefield over a duration. Cards also come in 4 rarities: common (grey border), rare (white border), ultra-rare (yellow border), and legendary (cyan border). Rarities determine how many copies of a card can be in a deck (including reskins), starting at 4 copies for commons down to 1 copy for legendaries. Many cards are unobtainable, either being NPC-exclusive or no longer having the obtainment method available to players.

Main page: Combat ({{aiHexaria)}}<br>Combat is the core mechanic behind Hexaria, where a player uses their cards to defeat enemies or other players for rewards or valor. Combat is turn-based, where each turn, the players and enemies each get a chance to take their actions. Entities have many stats, including health, max health, Bits, status effects, buffs and debuffs, their deck, their hand, and their discard pile. At the start of a turn, a player/entity gains a Bit, with various effects increasing/decreasing earned and max Bits, which are used to play most cards. Standard players and entities can move up to 2 tiles away and play a card. Some cards are quickplay, which means they can be played mid-turn without ending it. Every turn for players lasts 30 seconds in most cases, where if a player hasn't selected an option, they will automatically skip their turn. At the end of a turn, all damage/healing effects trigger. Traps triggered will immediately deal damage/effects mid-turn. A battle ends when all players die (not including summoned allies) or when all enemies die. A battle can have up to 4 players in most cases, with enemies/allies only limited by the size of the battle area.</div>
