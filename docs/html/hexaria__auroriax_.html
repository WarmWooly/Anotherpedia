      <h1>Hexaria (Auroriax)</h1>
      <div>{{iHexaria}} is a hexagon-based puzzle game made by Auroriax and released onto itch.io. Hexaria is comprised of a hexagonal grid of colored hexagons where the player created a repeating pattern to destroy hexagons, increasing the score. The goal is to get the highest score or last the longest, depending on the gamemode, through destroying hexagons. A valid pattern requires the repetition of a 2 or more color combination at least twice (such as passing through a red, then a blue, another red, and another blue, creating the pattern RB repeated twice). The number of colors increases with difficulty, forcing the player to find better combinations to efficiently clear hexagons.</div>
