      <div>Hibberts Gore is a gore in Lincoln County, Maine. <<Asofthe 2020 census>>, it has a population of 1. The gore has an area of 0.752 mis-p2.&pHibberts Gore was a part of Maine that was looked over by surveyors, where a local happened to live. It currently remains unincorperated.&pThere was a sudden spike in population of 100% in 1980, which then reduced back to 1 in the following decade.
The only resident, Karen Keller, moved to the gore after a divorce. She moved from Vermont with her husband in the late 1970s, where she later divorced him, accounting for the sudden population rise and dip. After a 2001 Boston Globe article thrust her into the spotlight, she has been attempting to conceal herself, notably by asking if she could be counted with the rest of Lincoln County, which was denied. Her house is relatively close to the town Palermo. Karen dislikes the idea that she is special, yet isolated, due to arbitrary boundaries, as she stated:The article in the Boston Globe that spread Karen's name was by Cindy Rodriguez and titled Population 1. It had multiple errors, such as claiming that it had no mailbox, that the house had an A-frame and not a square frame, and that bipolar disorder caused Karen to live in Hibberts Gore and not a failed marriage. Despite Karen's requests to the United States Census Bureau, she only got this in response:</div>
