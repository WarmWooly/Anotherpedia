  <h1>Hibberts Gore</h1>
  <div><<shortSmall gore in Maineshort>><<graph(src=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTe_vwKiiKr-EWUaeUV-ybDKJMnjrP57bm3LWUha6l58HVwkVv0HYnnkw_IJWzO-L8IfuIVurTaV_O_/pubchart?oid=1409452204&amp;format=interactive(width=600(height=371(cap=The population of Hibberts Gore from 1940 to 2020.graph>><<img(src=git/hibberts gore maine.png(cap=An [[aerial photo]] of the only residence in Hibberts Gore.(leftImgimg>><<img(src=git/hibberts gore wide.jpg(cap=A wider shot, showing the entire gore.(leftImgimg>>{{bHibberts Gore}} is a [[gore|gore (surveying)]] in [[Lincoln County|Lincoln County]], [[Maine]]. <<Asofthe [[2020 census|2020 United States census]]>>, it has a [[population]] of 1. The gore has an [[area]] of 0.752 [[mi|mile]]{{s-p2}}.&pHibberts Gore was a part of Maine that was looked over by [[surveyors|surveyor]], where a local happened to live. It currently remains [[unincorperated|unincorperated area]].&pThere was a sudden spike in population of 100% in 1980, which then reduced back to 1 in the following decade.<<hrResidentshr>>The only resident, [[Karen Keller]], moved to the gore after a [[divorce]]. She moved from [[Vermont]] with her husband in the late 1970s, where she later divorced him, accounting for the sudden population rise and dip. After a 2001 [[Boston Globe]] article thrust her into the spotlight, she has been attempting to conceal herself, notably by asking if she could be counted with the rest of Lincoln County, which was denied. Her [[house]] is relatively close to the [[town]] [[Palermo|Palermo]]. Karen dislikes the idea that she is special, yet isolated, due to arbitrary boundaries, as she stated:<<quoThese people from these big papers come. Why? What have I done? It's a bunch of lines on a map. Nothing else. What have I accomplished? What have I ever done to make anyone's life better? What good for the planet? What good for people? What good for anybody? Why? It's hogwash. It's a crock.quo>>The article in the Boston Globe that spread Karen's name was by [[Cindy Rodriguez]] and titled {{iPopulation 1}}. It had multiple errors, such as claiming that it had no [[mailbox]], that the house had an A-frame and not a square frame, and that [[bipolar disorder]] caused Karen to live in Hibberts Gore and not a failed marriage. Despite Karen's requests to the [[United States Census Bureau]], she only got this in response:<<quo{{iBecause Hibberts Gore is a legally defined geographic entity, even though it has no governmental functions, the Census Bureau must recognize this existence as a political unit and does not have the authority to incorporate it into the neighboring towns for the purpose of data. If collection tabulation and presentation of the boundary were to change for the 2020 census legal action would have to be taken on the local level.}}quo>></div>
