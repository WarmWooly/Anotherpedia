      <h1>Hibberts Gore</h1>
      <div>Hibberts Gore is a gore (surveying) in Lincoln County, Maine. <<Asofthe 2020 United States census>>, it has a population of 1. The gore has an area of 0.752 miles-p2.<br><br>Hibberts Gore was a part of Maine that was looked over by surveyor, where a local happened to live. It currently remains unincorperated area.<br><br>There was a sudden spike in population of 100% in 1980, which then reduced back to 1 in the following decade.

The only resident, Karen Keller, moved to the gore after a divorce. She moved from Vermont with her husband in the late 1970s, where she later divorced him, accounting for the sudden population rise and dip. After a 2001 Boston Globe article thrust her into the spotlight, she has been attempting to conceal herself, notably by asking if she could be counted with the rest of Lincoln County, which was denied. Her house is relatively close to the town Palermo. Karen dislikes the idea that she is special, yet isolated, due to arbitrary boundaries, as she stated:These people from these big papers come. Why? What have I done? It's a bunch of lines on a map. Nothing else. What have I accomplished? What have I ever done to make anyone's life better? What good for the planet? What good for people? What good for anybody? Why? It's hogwash. It's a crock.The article in the Boston Globe that spread Karen's name was by Cindy Rodriguez and titled Population 1. It had multiple errors, such as claiming that it had no mailbox, that the house had an A-frame and not a square frame, and that bipolar disorder caused Karen to live in Hibberts Gore and not a failed marriage. Despite Karen's requests to the United States Census Bureau, she only got this in response:Because Hibberts Gore is a legally defined geographic entity, even though it has no governmental functions, the Census Bureau must recognize this existence as a political unit and does not have the authority to incorporate it into the neighboring towns for the purpose of data. If collection tabulation and presentation of the boundary were to change for the 2020 census legal action would have to be taken on the local level.</div>
