      <h1>Hickory tussock moth</h1>
      <div>The hickory tussock moth, also known as the hickory tiger moth or hickory halisidota, is a species of moth located in northeastern North America. The scientific name is Lophocampa caryae. It is well known for causing skin irritation on contact with the caterpillar.
The larva is covered in white spines, with a black stripe down the middle, and two pairs at the front and back of its body. This design may be a form of aposematism to reduce the chance of being eaten. Contact of these hairs can cause a reaction, known as contact dermatitis. They eat from a variety of trees, notably the Hickory tree, where they get their common name. The caterpillar grows up to 4.5 centimeters, or roughly 1.7 inches.
The moth has a pair of brown forewings covered in white spots, while the hindwings are a dirty white. The body is covered in brown hair. Their wingspan is between 3.8 and 5 centimeters (1.5 to 2 inches). They are nocturnal, and spend most of their time awake mating.</div>
