      <h1>Highway</h1>
      <div>A highway is a main road used for travelling, usually by a motor vehicle, between towns and cities. Highways are often mixed with freeways, but freeways are a type of highway. A highway is technically any public road (including train tracks), but it is most often used for large roads for faster travel.</div>
