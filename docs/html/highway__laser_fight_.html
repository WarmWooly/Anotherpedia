      <h1>Highway (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Highway is a medium-sized outdoor map (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox Game) based on highway bridges. Players spawn on one of the sides of the bridge. Various drivable and damageable vehicles litter the map, acting as a dynamic obstacle in such a thin battlefield. Small movable pillars separate the highway into two sides. A tall rock formation can be reached by the side of the bridge, awarding the badge (Roblox) You Rock! (Laser Fight)

The river covering the bottom of the map is lethal, killing players on contact. The death screen will say, "The River killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X drowned|X forgot how to swim|X hates water|X overhydrated|X forgot to put on their life jacket|X hit water too fast|X slept with the fishes|X went to Davy Jone's locker|X had aquaphobia|X inhaled H2O|X thought they were Aquaman|X tried to become a fish;;

The vehicles can be entered by walking on top of them, sitting the player down and going into third person. Some vehicles have seats that do not control the vehicle towards their backs. Players can still shoot while driving. Jump (Space) to exit a vehicle. Vehicles will take damage by being shot or by driving into other objects, with higher speeds increasing the damage dealt to the vehicle. A vehicle will start smoking and burning when it is low on HP, and will explode on death. Players near the explosion will get killed, with the death screen saying "An Explosion killed you!" with one of the following death messages appearing in the feed:;;X was turned into dust|X blew up|X didn't get an extended warrenty|X went out with a bang|X missed the creeper behind them|X exploded;;Exploded cars will despawn after a few seconds.</div>
