      <h1>Hindsight is 20/20</h1>
      <div>For the book, see {{aiHindsight is 2020 (book).}}<br>"Hindsight is 20/20" is a proverb describing how in hindsight would change the actions a person would do. Similar to "woulda, coulda, shoulda", "hindsight is 20/20" is a dynamic way to express that the past is always clear and known because it has already happened, which is in contrast with planning for the future. The "20/20" is based on visual acuity, with 20/20 vision being the standard vision clarity expected.</div>
