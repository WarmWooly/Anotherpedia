  <h1>Horizon</h1>
  <div><<shortLine between the surface and the skyshort>><<img(src=git/horizon.svg(cap=A [[diagram]] of different horizons from the observer's perspective and a side view.img>>The {{bhorizon}} is the line between the [[surface]] of a [[celestial body]] and the [[sky]] based on the [[perspective]] of an [[observer]]. The [[true horizon]] is the point where the [[view]] from the observer crosses the surface of the celestial body as if there were no [[obstructions|obstruction]] or [[refraction|atmospheric refraction]], while the [[apparent horizon]] takes the effects of the [[atmosphere]] into account. The [[visible horizon]] is the point where the view from the observer actually meets the sky, taking obstructions into account. The [[astronomical horizon]] is a [[right angle]] from the [[zenith]] of the observer extending outwards.</div>
