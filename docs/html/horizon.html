      <h1>Horizon</h1>
      <div>The horizon is the line between the surface of a celestial body and the sky based on the perspective of an observer. The true horizon is the point where the view from the observer crosses the surface of the celestial body as if there were no obstructions or refraction, while the apparent horizon takes the effects of the atmosphere into account. The visible horizon is the point where the view from the observer actually meets the sky, taking obstructions into account. The astronomical horizon is a right angle from the zenith of the observer extending outwards.</div>
