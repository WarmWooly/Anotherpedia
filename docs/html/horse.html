      <h1>Horse</h1>
      <div>A horse (with the name of {{bEquus ferus caballus}}) is a four-legged mammal that has been domesticated by humans which belongs in the family of Equidae. Horses evolved from an ancestor over 45 million years ago from a small animal close to the Eohippus. It is believed that humans started horse domestication around 4000 BCE, with it becoming widespread in 3000 BCE. Horses are well known for their ability to run at high speeds, often between 10 to 16 mph, but they can get up to over 25 mph when galloping. Horses age up to 25 to 30 years old, and are fully mature by five. Horses graze on grass and grain.</div>
