      <h1>Horse Race Tests</h1>
      <div>For the fan game based on the series, see {{aihorse race tests (fan game).}}<br>{{iHorse Race Tests}} is a physics simulation video game web series on Twitter by the user <<link(src=https://x.com/snakesandrews(text=@snakesandrewslink>> starting on April 1, 2025. The series follows various crudely-drawn pixel art horse horse racing on 2D maps bouncing around randomly to achieve a simple objective, such as collecting food or shooting a basketball into a basketball hoop. As the series has gone on, production quality (such as audio and colorblind accessibility) has increased. <<AsofJune 2025>>, Horse Race Tests is on its second season. There is a large Horse Race Tests fanbase around the series, often discussing the Horse Race Tests lore and the various Horse Race Tests characters, creating Horse Race Tests fanart of the series, and "betting" on which horses will win in subsequent races.</div>
