      <div>For the fan game based on the series, see aihorse race tests (fan game).&spHorse Race Tests is a simulated video game web series on Twitter by the user <<link(src=https://x.com/snakesandrews(text=@snakesandrewslink>> starting on April 1, 2025.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/snakesandrews/status/1907202085478596821(text=refCountref>> The series follows various crudely-drawn pixel art horses racing on 2D maps bouncing around randomly to achieve a simple objective, such as collecting food or shooting a basketball into a hoop. As the series has gone on, production quality (such as audio and colorblind friendliness) has increased. <<AsofJune 2025>>, Horse Race Tests is on its second season. There is a large fanbase around the series, often discussing the lore and the various horses, creating fanart of the series, and "betting" on which horses will win in subsequent races.</div>
