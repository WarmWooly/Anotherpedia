  <h1>How to make/edit pages</h1>
  <div><<shortGuidelines to make pages on Anotherpediashort>>Want to {{bmake a page}}, or add something new to one that currently exists? Anyone can do it (yes, anyone, on {{b{{ianything}}}}).&pMaking a page is easy, only requiring some time and effort. <<hrEditing syntaxhr>>Just like the non-random counterpart [[Wikipedia]], Anotherpedia has different tags that can be used to do a variety of things, such as adding links, images, and styling. To create/edit a page, click "Edit Page" or type in the search bar for a page that does not exist yet.<<hr2Linkshr2>>{{tMain page: [[Link (Anotherpedia)]]}}&spLinks are vital for finding information. Links are created by surrounding text in a pair of square brackets, also known as &lsqb;&rsqb;. Surrounding text in brackets creates a link:&sp<<nostyle[[Person]]nostyle>> = [[Person]]&spIn cases where you want to have the text of the link differ from where the link goes to, add a bar in the middle.&sp<<nostyle[[People|Person]]nostyle>> = [[People|Person]]&spAttempt to only use a link once per page on the first instance of the term, unless required due to page length.<<hr2Paragraphshr2>>To add paragraph breaks, use an ampersand, displayed as &, behind a p or an sp: <<nostyle&p, &spnostyle>>. They each represent a full break (2 line breaks) {{codeAlt + P}} and a half break (1 line break) {{codeAlt + S}} respectively.<<hr2Imageshr2>><<img(src=git/orbit.gif(cap=An example of adding a [[GIF]].img>>To add images, start the tag with &lt;&lt;img, then add your source with (src=your file here, and the caption with (cap=This is an <<nostyle[[example]]nostyle>> of a <<nostyle[[caption]]nostyle>>. Close it off with another <<nostyleimg>>nostyle>> tag. {{codeAlt + I}}&sp<<nostyle<<img(src=git/orbit.gif(cap=An example of adding a [[GIF]].img>>nostyle>>&spImages can be gotten by using their link as the source. Avoid using the same image on multiple pages when possible.&pYou can add tags after the image based on the need, especially when images may be hidden by a light/dark background, if the image, is short, or if the image is packed with information.&sp(brightImg - This can be used to give a bright background to the image inside.&sp(darkImg - This is used to give a dark background to the image inside.&sp(galleryImg - Used for image galleries, allows multiple images to be side-by-side.&sp(spanImg - This causes the image to go across the entire page, which is useful for short, yet long, images.&sp(bigImg - This increases the maximum size of the image, which is useful for information-dense images.<<hr2Videoshr2>><<vid(src=git/balatro gameplay.mp4(cap=An example of adding a [[video]].vid>>To add videos, start the tag with <<nostyle<<vid, then add your source with (src=your file here, and the caption with (cap=This is an [[example]] of a [[caption]]. Close it off with another vid>>nostyle>> tag. {{codeAlt + V}}&sp<<nostyle<<vid(src=git/balatro gameplay.mp4(cap=An example of adding a [[video]].vid>>nostyle>><<hr2YouTube videoshr2>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ(cap=A popular [[song]].yt>>To add youtube videos, start with <<nostyle<<ytnostyle>>, add the video link under (src=, add a caption with (cap=, and close it with <<nostyleyt>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + Y}}&sp<<nostyle<<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ(cap=A popular [[song]].yt>>nostyle>><<hr2Audiohr2>>To add audio, start with <<nostyle<<aud, add the file's link, then close it with aud>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + U}}&sp<<nostyle<<audgit/tired.oggaud>>nostyle>>&sp<<audgit/tired.oggaud>><<hr2Quoteshr2>>To add a separation for a quote, surround the quote in <<nostyle<<quo and quo>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + Q}}&sp<<nostyle<<quo"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly."quo>>nostyle>><<quo"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly."quo>><<hr2Codehr2>>To add a separation for code, surround the code in <<nostyle<<code and code>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + K}}&sp<<nostyle<<codedocument.getElementById("Fortnite").innerHTML = "Bad"&amp;spdocument.getElementById("Minecraft").innerHTML = "Good"code>>nostyle>><<codedocument.getElementById("Fortnite").innerHTML = "Bad"&spdocument.getElementById("Minecraft").innerHTML = "Good"code>><<hr2Headershr2>>To add headers and subheaders, such as these, surround the header in <<nostyle<<hr and hr>> or <<hr2 and hr2>>nostyle>> respectively. Adding {{code(forceBreak}} to  a <<nostyle<<hr>>nostyle>> tag will prevent content, such as images, from overflowing past the header.&sp<<nostyle<<hrEditing & Stylinghr>>nostyle>> {{codeAlt + 1}}&sp<<nostyle<<hr2Headershr2>>nostyle>> {{codeAlt + 2}}&sp<<nostyle<<hr3Smaller headershr3>>nostyle>> {{codeAlt + 3}}<<hr2Listshr2>>To create lists, surround the list with a pair of colons, which are <<nostyle::, or semicolons, which are ;;nostyle>>. Colons will be used for ordered lists (using numbers), while semicolons will be for unordered lists (using bullet points). When splitting elements up, use |. Here is an example of a list:&sp<<nostyle;;Apple|Orange|Banana;;nostyle>> ;;Apple|Orange|Banana;;<<hr2Infoboxeshr2>>Infoboxes contain basic information about a topic. To create an infobox, first write the tags <<nostyle<<info and info>>nostyle>>. By default, entries will take up a whole row. To add another row, insert ||. To split a row into a field and entry (i.e. {{bData}} 10), use |. Here's an example infobox:&sp<<nostyle<<info{{bI'm an infobox!}}||{{bRow 1}}|Entry 1||{{bRow 2}}|Entry 2info>>nostyle>><<info{{bI'm an infobox!}}||{{bRow 1}}|Entry 1||{{bRow 2}}|Entry 2info>><<hr2Tableshr2>>Tables can be used for any large set of data. To create a table, first write the tags <<nostyle<<table and table>>nostyle>>. To add a column, use |, and to add another row, use ||. Here's an example table:&sp<<nostyle<<table{{bReaders}}|{{bEditors}}||10|1table>>nostyle>><<table{{bReaders}}|{{bEditors}}||10|1table>><<hr2Short texthr2>>To add short text to help find a page when searching and to summarize the content in three to ten words, surround the short text for the page with <<nostyle<<short and short>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + H}} It should be put at the start of the page, and shouldn't start with words such as "A", "The", "Is", or "Are" for best practice. Only one short tag can be used per page.<<hr2Stylinghr2>>To style text, you surround it in double braces, which are <<nostyle{{ and }}nostyle>>. Depending on the first character or characters, it will create a span with that styling.&sp<<nostyle{{bBold Text}}nostyle>> = {{bBold Text}} - Used to make text bold. {{codeCtrl + B}}&sp<<nostyle{{iItalic Text}}nostyle>> = {{iItalic Text}} - Used to make text italic. {{codeCtrl + I}}&sp<<nostyle{{uUnderline Text}}nostyle>> = {{uUnderline Text}} - Used to make an underline for text. {{codeCtrl + U}}&sp<<nostyle{{u-dUnderline (Dotted) Text}}nostyle>> = {{u-dUnderline (Dotted) Text}} - Used to make a dotted underline for text.&sp<<nostyle{{u-eUnderline (Error) Text}}nostyle>> = {{u-eUnderline (Error) Text}} - Used to make an error underline for text.&sp<<nostyle{{sStrikethrough Text}}nostyle>> = {{sStrikethrough Text}} - Used to cross out text.&sp<<nostyle{{s-bSubscript Text}}nostyle>> = {{s-bSubscript Text}} - Used to add subscripts, such as in chemical formulas. {{codeCtrl + .}}&sp<<nostyle{{s-pSupercript Text}}nostyle>> = {{s-pSuperscript Text}} - Used to add superscripts, such as in exponents. <<nostyle{{s-unostyle>> can also be used. {{codeCtrl + ,}}&sp<<nostyle{{tTopper Text}}nostyle>> = {{tTopper Text}} - Used to display text that contains important information, usually put at the beginning of a page or section. {{codeCtrl + Q}}&sp<<nostyle{{aiAnti-italic Text}}nostyle>> = {{aiAnti-italic Text}} - Used to reverse italic text. Ex. {{tFor the [[TV show]], see [[{{ai24}} (TV show)]].}} {{codeCtrl + E}}&sp<<nostyle{{codeCode Text}}nostyle>> = {{codeCode Text}} - Used to add inline code text, such as for programming variables. {{codeCtrl + K}}&spThese styles can be stacked by nesting them inside each other.<<hr2Symbolshr2>>{{tFor a more comprehensive list, see [[Symbol syntax for Anotherpedia]].}}&spThese are some of the symbols that are able to be added with codes:&sp<<nostyle&regnostyle>> - &reg&sp<<nostyle&copynostyle>> - &copy&sp<<nostyle&tradenostyle>> - &trade&sp<<nostyle&degnostyle>> - &deg<<hr2Notes & referenceshr2>>Notes and references are used to add hoverable text that that contains information or external sources. These can be added with <<nostyle<<note(content=[your text here](text=[a]note>>nostyle>> {{codeAlt + O}} and <<nostyle<<ref(content=[your text here](text=[1]ref>>nostyle>> {{codeAlt + R}}. The text area can be replaced with {{inoteCount}} and {{irefCount}} to automatically generate the note's external appearance (such as {{n[a]}} or {{n[2]}}).<<hr2As ofshr2>>Information can become dated. By using <<nostyle<<asof>>nostyle>>, information that can change over time will be viewable in [[as ofs in Anotherpedia pages]]. By doing <<nostyle<<asofMonth Year>>nostyle>> or other measurement of time, an "as of Month Date" will replace it. By doing <<nostyle<<Asof>>nostyle>>, "As of" will be used instead. <<hr2Disclaimershr2>>Disclaimers are used to give an easily viewable warning to readers regarding content that may fall under the [[Anotherpedia disclaimer]], such as content covering medical, legal, or potentially dangerous information. {{bThere is NO REQUIREMENT to use disclaimers!}} Disclaimers should be used when applicable, but as an author or editor for pages, there is no responsibility for you to use disclaimers.&p<<nostyle<<nomedical>>nostyle>> should be used for articles covering [[medicine]], [[healthcare]], or other relevant topics.&sp<<nostyle<<nolegal>>nostyle>> should be used for articles covering the [[practice of law]] or other relevant topics.&sp<<nostyle<<nodanger>>nostyle>> should be used for articles covering topics that may be [[dangerous]] or [[illegal]] if performed.<<hr2Commentshr2>>Comments are used to add information to a page for other editors to read. Article content should not be put into comments.<<commentOnly editors will see this!comment>> Surround the text your wish to comment with <<nostyle<<comment and comment>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + M}}<<hr2No stylinghr2>>Sometimes syntax and styles can override text when unwanted, such as for <<nostyle::nostyle>> automatically making lists. Surround the text with your wish to not be styled with <<nostyle<<nonostyle>>style and nostyle<<nostyle>>nostyle>>. {{codeAlt + N}}<<hrKeybindshr>>Keybinds are various combinations of keys used to decrease the amount of time spent writing. Instead of writing out the full <<nostyle{{i}}nostyle>> around the text you wish to italicize, you can just use {{codeCtrl + I}}! These are the following keybinds:<<hr2Defaulthr2>>{{codeCtrl + C}} -- Copies selected text&sp{{codeCtrl + V}} -- Pastes selected text&sp{{codeCtrl + X}} -- Cuts selected text&sp{{codeCtrl + Z}} -- Undo&sp{{codeCtrl + Shift + Z}} or {{codeCtrl + Y}} -- Redo<<hr2Stylinghr2>>{{codeCtrl + B}} -- Bolds text&sp{{codeCtrl + I}} -- Italicizes text&sp{{codeCtrl + U}} -- Underlines text&sp{{codeCtrl + .}} -- Subscripts text&sp{{codeCtrl + ,}} -- Superscripts text&sp{{codeCtrl + Q}} -- Topper-ifies text&sp{{codeCtrl + E}} -- Anti-italicizes text&sp{{codeCtrl + K}} -- Code-ifies text<<hr2Tagshr2>>{{codeAlt + 1}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<hr>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + 2}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<hr2>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + 3}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<hr3>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + T}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<table>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + K}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<code>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + H}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<short>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + Q}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<quo>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + N}} -- Creates &lt;&lt;nostyle&gt;&gt; tag&sp{{codeAlt + M}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<comment>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + F}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<safe>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + U}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<aud>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + I}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<img>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + V}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<vid>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + Y}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<yt>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + R}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<ref>>nostyle>> tag&sp{{codeAlt + O}} -- Creates <<nostyle<<note>>nostyle>> tag<<hr2Symbolshr2>>{{codeAlt + P}} -- Creates <<nostyle&pnostyle>> symbol&sp{{codeAlt + S}} -- Creates <<nostyle&spnostyle>> symbol<<hr2Commandhr2>>{{codeAlt + C}} -- Copies the article code&sp{{codeAlt + G}} -- Regenerates section titles for sidebar<<hrWriting information and tipshr>>{{tFor the full guide on best practices, see [[Anotherpedia best practices]].}}&spThis information is used for consistency, common style, and other information.&sp<<hr2Copy Codehr2>>When editing, there is a button labeled "Copy Code". This will automatically put a [[JSON object]] in your [[clipboard|clipboard (copy and paste)]], which can then be copied and pasted. This is used to share and store the contents of the page externally, and the code is used to call the page contents when the website loads it. {{codeAlt + C}}<<hr2.txt Codehr2>>This button will copy the code onto a [[text file]], which will automatically be downloaded to the browser. It is also much more efficient for sending larger pages.<<hr2Submithr2>>This button generates a text file that gets sent to the Anotherpedia [[Discord|Discord (application)]] (which can be joined at <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>>) to be reviewed and added to Anotherpedia.<<hr2Restorehr2>>When editing, changes are automatically stored in [[local storage|local storage (JavaScript)]], which is saved to the browser. The last automatic save can be retrieved by clicking the "Restore" button. It will override the contents of the page with what was last saved. Saving only occurs when the page is edited. The use of this feature is in the case of accidentally unloading the page (clicking a link while editing, reloading the page, closing the page) and should {{bNOT}} be used as a method of storing pages.&p{{bWARNING:}} As soon as the page is edited, the save is overridden, which cannot be reversed. As said before, this is not intended to be for storage, but as a way to fix a mistake in the simplest way possible. Edits on pages that have not been made yet will automatically be restored.<<hr2Mobile Edithr2>>This button will bring up a draggable input which will be displayed over the page. The use of this is to watch edits made when editing larger pages. It can be dragged by clicking on the top of the input (labeled --- Drag Me! ---) and resized in the bottom right corner. It will work just like the input box below. It can be disabled by hitting the mobile edit button again. All edits made in the lower input box will be transferred to the mobile input box and vice versa. This feature is not accessible to mobile users.<<hr2Reg. Sectionshr2>>This button will regenerate the sections as displayed by the sidebar while editing. This will allow editors to update the sidebar to view how the sections will be displayed when the page is submitted and in use. The reason it can't be updated live is because of the lag and delay caused by updating the section with every change to the page while editing. {{codeAlt + G}}<<hr2Page titleshr2>>Make the title as simple as possible. If there are multiple topics with the same name, add information in parentheses.&sp[[Taboo (game)]] - Because "Taboo" is both a word and a game, the game is given parentheses to distinguish them. Titles can also be {{iitalicized}}, such as {{i[[Minecraft]]}}.<<hr2Page contenthr2>>The more random information, the better! Avoid repeating statements and including information with poor and/or biased sourcing. Also, {{bnever copy from Wikipedia}}. It's not only plagiarism and removes the uniqueness of this website, but Wikipedia may also be outdated/wrong.<<hr2Starting sentencehr2>>Try to use the page title at the start of a sentence whenever possible.&sp[[Water]] - {{uWater}}, also known as H{{s-b2}}O or dihydrogen monoxide, is a clear liquid substance found across Earth.<<hr2Disambiguationhr2>>If there are multiple terms that primarily include or are the same as a page, then make a disambiguation page! It should only be used in the case where there are three or more related terms, such as [[cannonball (disambiguation)]] and [[goo (disambiguation)]].<<hr2Author styleshr2>>Want to have a cool-looking author text for making or helping on a lot of pages? To do so, just help or create more! Authors will automatically be given stylized text based on their count:&sp{{b10 pages}} - <span class="another10">authorName</span>&sp{{b25 pages}} - <span class="another25">authorName</span>&sp{{b50 pages}} - <span class="another50">authorName</span>&sp{{b100 pages}} - <span class="another100">authorName</span>&sp{{b200 pages}} - <span class="another200">authorName</span>&sp{{b500 pages}} - <span class="another500">authorName</span><<shortGuidelines to make pages on Anotherpediashort>></div>
