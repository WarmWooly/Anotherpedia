      <h1>How to make/edit pages</h1>
      <div>Want to make a page, or add something new to one that currently exists? Anyone can do it (yes, anyone, on {{ianything}}).&pMaking a page is easy, only requiring some time and effort. 
Just like the non-random counterpart Wikipedia, Anotherpedia has different tags that can be used to do a variety of things, such as adding links, images, and styling. To create/edit a page, click "Edit Page" or type in the search bar for a page that does not exist yet.
Main page: Link (Anotherpedia)&spLinks are vital for finding information. Links are created by surrounding text in a pair of square brackets, also known as &lsqb;&rsqb;. Surrounding text in brackets creates a link:&spPerson = Person&spIn cases where you want to have the text of the link differ from where the link goes to, add a bar in the middle.&spPeople = People&spAttempt to only use a link once per page on the first instance of the term, unless required due to page length.
To add paragraph breaks, use an ampersand, displayed as &, behind a p or an sp: &p, &sp. They each represent a full break (2 line breaks) codeAlt + P and a half break (1 line break) codeAlt + S respectively.
To add images, start the tag with &lt;&lt;img, then add your source with (src=your file here, and the caption with (cap=This is an example of a caption. Close it off with another img>> tag. codeAlt + I&sp&spImages can be gotten by using their link as the source. Avoid using the same image on multiple pages when possible.&pYou can add tags after the image based on the need, especially when images may be hidden by a light/dark background, if the image, is short, or if the image is packed with information.&sp(brightImg - This can be used to give a bright background to the image inside.&sp(darkImg - This is used to give a dark background to the image inside.&sp(galleryImg - Used for image galleries, allows multiple images to be side-by-side.&sp(spanImg - This causes the image to go across the entire page, which is useful for short, yet long, images.&sp(bigImg - This increases the maximum size of the image, which is useful for information-dense images.
To add videos, start the tag with tag. codeAlt + V&sp
To add youtube videos, start with . codeAlt + Y&sp
To add audio, start with . codeAlt + U&sp&sp
To add a separation for a quote, surround the quote in . codeAlt + Q&sp
To add a separation for code, surround the code in . codeAlt + K&sp
To add headers and subheaders, such as these, surround the header in 
 or 
 respectively. Adding code(forceBreak to a 
 tag will prevent content, such as images, from overflowing past the header.&sp
 codeAlt + 1&sp
 codeAlt + 2&sp
 codeAlt + 3
To create lists, surround the list with a pair of colons, which are ::, or semicolons, which are ;;. Colons will be used for ordered lists (using numbers), while semicolons will be for unordered lists (using bullet points). When splitting elements up, use |. Here is an example of a list:&sp;;Apple|Orange|Banana;; ;;Apple|Orange|Banana;;
Infoboxes contain basic information about a topic. To create an infobox, first write the tags <<info and info>>. By default, entries will take up a whole row. To add another row, insert ||. To split a row into a field and entry (i.e. Data 10), use |. Here's an example infobox:&sp<<infoI'm an infobox!||Row 1|Entry 1||Row 2|Entry 2info>><<infoI'm an infobox!||Row 1|Entry 1||Row 2|Entry 2info>>
Tables can be used for any large set of data. To create a table, first write the tags <<table and table>>. To add a column, use |, and to add another row, use ||. Here's an example table:&sp<<tableReaders|Editors||10|1table>><<tableReaders|Editors||10|1table>>
To add short text to help find a page when searching and to summarize the content in three to ten words, surround the short text for the page with . codeAlt + H It should be put at the start of the page, and shouldn't start with words such as "A", "The", "Is", or "Are" for best practice. Only one short tag can be used per page.
To style text, you surround it in double braces, which are and . Depending on the first character or characters, it will create a span with that styling.&spBold Text = Bold Text - Used to make text bold. codeCtrl + B&spItalic Text = Italic Text - Used to make text italic. codeCtrl + I&spuUnderline Text = uUnderline Text - Used to make an underline for text. codeCtrl + U&spu-dUnderline (Dotted) Text = u-dUnderline (Dotted) Text - Used to make a dotted underline for text.&spu-eUnderline (Error) Text = u-eUnderline (Error) Text - Used to make an error underline for text.&spsStrikethrough Text = sStrikethrough Text - Used to cross out text.&sps-bSubscript Text = s-bSubscript Text - Used to add subscripts, such as in chemical formulas. codeCtrl + .&sps-pSupercript Text = s-pSuperscript Text - Used to add superscripts, such as in exponents. s-u can also be used. {{codeCtrl + ,&spTopper Text = Topper Text - Used to display text that contains important information, usually put at the beginning of a page or section. codeCtrl + Q&spaiAnti-italic Text = aiAnti-italic Text - Used to reverse italic text. Ex. For the TV show, see {{ai24 (TV show).}} codeCtrl + E&spcodeCode Text = codeCode Text - Used to add inline code text, such as for programming variables. codeCtrl + K&spThese styles can be stacked by nesting them inside each other.
For a more comprehensive list, see Symbol syntax for Anotherpedia.&spThese are some of the symbols that are able to be added with codes:&sp&reg - &reg&sp&copy - &copy&sp&trade - &trade&sp&deg - &deg
Notes and references are used to add hoverable text that that contains information or external sources. These can be added with <<note(content=[your text here](text=[a]note>> codeAlt + O and <<ref(content=[your text here](text=[1]ref>> codeAlt + R. The text area can be replaced with noteCount and refCount to automatically generate the note's external appearance (such as n[a] or n[2]).
Information can become dated. By using <<asof>>, information that can change over time will be viewable in as ofs in Anotherpedia pages. By doing <<asofMonth Year>> or other measurement of time, an "as of Month Date" will replace it. By doing <<Asof>>, "As of" will be used instead. 
Disclaimers are used to give an easily viewable warning to readers regarding content that may fall under the Anotherpedia disclaimer, such as content covering medical, legal, or potentially dangerous information. There is NO REQUIREMENT to use disclaimers! Disclaimers should be used when applicable, but as an author or editor for pages, there is no responsibility for you to use disclaimers.&p<<nomedical>> should be used for articles covering medicine, healthcare, or other relevant topics.&sp<<nolegal>> should be used for articles covering the practice of law or other relevant topics.&sp<<nodanger>> should be used for articles covering topics that may be dangerous or illegal if performed.
Comments are used to add information to a page for other editors to read. Article content should not be put into comments. Surround the text your wish to comment with . codeAlt + M
Sometimes syntax and styles can override text when unwanted, such as for :: automatically making lists. Surround the text with your wish to not be styled with <<nostyle and nostyle>>. codeAlt + N
Keybinds are various combinations of keys used to decrease the amount of time spent writing. Instead of writing out the full around the text you wish to italicize, you can just use codeCtrl + I! These are the following keybinds:
codeCtrl + C -- Copies selected text&spcodeCtrl + V -- Pastes selected text&spcodeCtrl + X -- Cuts selected text&spcodeCtrl + Z -- Undo&spcodeCtrl + Shift + Z or codeCtrl + Y -- Redo
codeCtrl + B -- Bolds text&spcodeCtrl + I -- Italicizes text&spcodeCtrl + U -- Underlines text&spcodeCtrl + . -- Subscripts text&spcodeCtrl + , -- Superscripts text&spcodeCtrl + Q -- Topper-ifies text&spcodeCtrl + E -- Anti-italicizes text&spcodeCtrl + K -- Code-ifies text
codeAlt + 1 -- Creates <<hr>> tag&spcodeAlt + 2 -- Creates <<hr2>> tag&spcodeAlt + 3 -- Creates <<hr3>> tag&spcodeAlt + T -- Creates <<table>> tag&spcodeAlt + K -- Creates <<code>> tag&spcodeAlt + H -- Creates</div>
