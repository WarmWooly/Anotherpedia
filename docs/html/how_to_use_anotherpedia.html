  <h1>How to use Anotherpedia</h1>
  <div><<shortInformation regarding the usage of Anotherpediashort>>{{tThis page covers [[navigation|website navigation]] and use. To learn how to make and edit pages, see [[How to make/edit pages]].}}&sp[[Anotherpedia]] is designed closely to [[Wikipedia]], following many similar principles for navigation and use. The main goal is to make this [[website]] as usable as possible to allow users to fully experience Anotherpedia. Please read our [[disclaimer|Anotherpedia disclaimer]]!<<hrNavigationhr>>This sections discusses how to navigate the website, such as searching for other pages, using links, and going to the settings and home page.&sp<<hr2Linkshr2>>Links are the most prominent method for navigating around Anotherpedia. These are any text which is blue, purple, or red, which underlines when hovered. They may also display a tooltip, which can be toggled in the [[settings]]. Most links will go to another [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]], but some may take you to another website. Red links do not go to a page, but rather to a page creation screen. This is because red links go to pages that have not been made yet. They do not have reading content and should be avoided when attempting to casually browse around. You can use it to create pages, however, as outlined in  [[How to make/edit pages]].<<hr2Redirectshr2>>Redirects are a way for multiple terms to link to the same page, such as if the name has multiple forms ([[Satirical]] --> [[Satire]]), [[abbreviations|abbreviation]] ([[DMS]] --> [[Dynamic message sign]]), full names ([[Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi]] --> [[Indira Gandhi]]), or for other variations ([[Dragonair (Pokémon)]] --> [[Dragonair]]). Redirects will be notified using text under the page's title, such as "⤷ Redirected from Satirical". This will not affect the content on the page.<<hr2Searchinghr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia search.png(cap=The search bar for Anotherpedia with the prompt "qu".img>>One of the main methods of navigating Anotherpedia is by using the [[search bar]]. Typing in a prompt, such as {{ilog}}, will show a list of [[pages|page (Anotherpedia)]], such as [[{{bLog}}o|Logo]], [[Complication (horo{{blog}}y)|Complication (horology)]], and [[Etymo{{blog}}y|Etymology]]. These all have the term 'log' in some position of the name. It will first display all pages that start with the prompt, then those that include the prompt, and then any redirects. They will also attempt to find pages using the short text, which can be enabled and disabled in the [[settings]]. Hitting [[enter|enter key]] will select the top page based on the prompt, and clicking on the name will send you to the page selected.&pIf the exact name for a page has not been made yet, an option labeled "Make page for xyz" will be shown, which can be clicked to go and make a new page with the given prompt. If many pages match the search (such as the letter {{ia}}), an option labeled "See more for xyz" will be shown, which will bring you to a page listing all other pages with the given prompt.<<hr2Home pagehr2>>To get to the [[home page]], either click the word "Anotherpedia" or the button with the [[logo]] for Anotherpedia when displayed on mobile. This will automatically send you to the home page. By default, this is [[Main page]], which can be changed in the settings.<<hr2Settingshr2>>To get to the [[settings]], either click on the word "Settings" or the button with the gear emoji when displayed on mobile. You can also search for the settings in the search bar or find the link on the [[Main page]]. This will automatically send you to the settings. This will not be displayed when already in the settings page.<<hr2Random pagehr2>>Going to a random page is often used to explore topics that you wouldn't normally search for. To go to a random page, either click on the words "Random Page" or the button with the dice emoji when displayed on mobile. The page selected will be random and not influenced by any other actions.<<hrSettingshr>>[[Settings]] are made to have Anotherpedia be as usable for as many people as possible, while also allowing self-expression. This section will discuss all the options available to users and what they do. Settings will only update in different tabs when they are reloaded.<<hr2Visualshr2>>These settings primarily change the appearance of Anotherpedia and not the displayed content. {{bTheme}} changes the color scheme of the website, including text, links, background, and other elements. There are several default color scheme options which can be chosen,  which can be manually edited when advanced settings are enabled. {{bFont}} changes the text font of the website. There are several default font combinations which can be chosen, which can be manually eduted when advanced settings are enabled. {{bText size}} changes the size of all text on the website, which can be changed via the slider. {{bAuthor colors}} toggles whether authors at the bottom of pages will have colored text. {{bSidebar size}} changes how large the sidebar and the article are in relation to one another.<<hr2Mediahr2>>These settings change the visible media on the website, such as [[images|image]] and [[videos|video]]. {{bImages}} toggles whether images will be displayed on the website. {{bImage brightness}} changes the brightness of images on the website. {{bPDFs}} toggles whether [[PDFs|PDF]] will be displayed on the website. {{bYouTube videos}} toggles whether videos from [[YouTube]] will be displayed on the website. {{bGraphs}} toggles whether [[graphs|graph]] from [[Google Sheets]] will be displayed on the website. {{bWebsites}} toggles whether other websites, in the form of a box on the page, will be displayed on the website. {{bExternal links}} toggles whether links to other websites will be able to be used.{{bExternal link preview}} toggles whether link tooltips will show a preview of the website when possible (disabled by default).<<hr2Tooltipshr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia tooltip.png(cap=A tooltip for Anotherpedia.img>>These settings relate to tooltips, which appear when hovering over links or notes. {{bTooltips}} toggles whether a tooltip will be displayed when hovering over a link or note. {{bAutomatic scrolling}} determines how fast tooltips scroll when the content is larger than what the tooltip can display. This is not an option on mobile, which can manually scroll on the tooltip. {{bAutomatic scroll delay}} determines how long you have to hover over a tooltip before it starts to automatically scroll. This is also not an option on mobile.<<hr2Searchhr2>>These settings relate to the [[search bar]] and features related to it. {{bShort text}} toggles the usually grey text below the name of a page when searching to summarize what the page is about. {{bSearch using short text}} toggles whether short text will be taken into account when trying to search for pages. {{bSearch bar size}} changes the maximum size of the search bar, which may be limited based on the size of the device (i.e. phones).<<hr2Pageshr2>>These settings relate to page management and the [[home page]]. {{bHome page}} allows you to type in a page to type in the name of a page to become the home page, which will be linked to the word "Anotherpedia" or the button with the [[logo]] for Anotherpedia on mobile. {{bNote area}} creates a section at the end of a page listing off all notes present in the page.<<safe {{bSafe mode}} toggles whether pages with more "mature" content will be hidden. This also applies to some text, images, or other elements in pages. Some examples are [[Martini]], [[Methylamine]], and  [[Ring girl]]. Links to the pages will automatically be shown as unmade. Searching for the page will not bring up any results. The page can't be randomly found. For all intensive purposes, the page is unable to be accessed in safe mode.safe>><<hr2Otherhr2>>These settings do not have a set theme. {{bWikipedia-ify}} automatically changes the visual settings to replicate those as seen on [[Wikipedia]]. {{bAdvanced settings}} toggles the ability to see more settings the average user wouldn't need to use. It also allows you to toggle "joke settings" to make Anotherpedia more fun. It's reccomended to try them out yourself before reading ahead, as it will [[spoil|spoiler]] what they do. {{bMuch wow mode}} creates links across the page in [[Comic Sans]] similarly to the [[much wow meme|Much Wow]]. {{bAskew mode}} slightly changes the orientation of all the elements on the page, such as text, links, images, and buttons. {{bChase mode}} has all links on the page follow the mouse cursor, which can't be toggled on mobile.<<hr2Resethr2>>The {{bReset Settings}} button changes all the settings back to their default state.<<hrActionshr>>There are a wide variety of other actions which can be performed on Anotherpedia.&sp<<hr2Page editinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[How to make/edit pages]]}}&spCreating and editing pages is the core for Anotherpedia! Going to a page that hasn't been made will automatically show the editing interface. On pages which have been made, click the text "Edit Page" or the button with the pencil emoji on mobile. This will open the editing interface at the bottom of the page. Details for editing, such as the guidelines, syntax, and other information can be found at [[How to make/edit pages]].<<hr2Image expansionhr2>>Whe left clicked or tapped on mobile, an image will be fully expanded to fit the size of a page. To undo this, click or tap on the image again. Changing the brightness of images will not affect the expanded image. The main use is to allow you to display images or get more detail from the image. You can also do other normal image actions such as saving and downloading the image when expanded.<<hr2Image popupshr2>>{{tMain page: [[Image popup (Anotherpedia)]]}}&spAn image popup is a popup of an image which can be created by right-clicking it. This action can be performed on mobile, but it will only create a new tab with the image. The image can be manipulated, such as changing the size, shape, rotation, and location, when in the form of a popup.<<hr2Opening new tabshr2>>This does not relate to the normal function on [[browsers|web browser]] where users can right-click to open up a menu. Anotherpedia allows users to quickly open new tabs for pages by right-clicking or holding down on mobile on Settings, Random Page, and in the search bar. For example, searching up "Log" and right-clicking the option for [[Logo]] will create a new tab with the page logo. The primary use is to allow users to quickly search or go to thier settings without leaving their current page.</div>
