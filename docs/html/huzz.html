      <h1>Huzz</h1>
      <div>Huzz is derogatory 2024 Gen Alpha slang deriving from similar terms such as hussy or hoes used on TikTok and Twitch. Huzz is often used in place of "hoes", such as "where the huzz at?" Portmanteaus of huzz, such as "buzz/muzz" (boy huzz/man huzz) and ruzz/rohuzz (Roblox huzz) are also popular when describing specific types of huzz. Huzz can be confused as slang for a husband due to how "huzz" and "hus-" sound the same.</div>
