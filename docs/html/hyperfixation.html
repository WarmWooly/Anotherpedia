      <h1>Hyperfixation</h1>
      <div><<nomedical>>Hyperfixation, also written as hyper fixation, relates to the fixation on a singular topic, idea, or object, to an overbearing extent, making it more difficult to communicate with others. Hyperfixation is most relevant in those diagnosed with ADHD, autism, and other mental disorders. The main problem with hyperfixation is the potential ostracization that may be caused by the topic or repeated discussion of a single topic.</div>
