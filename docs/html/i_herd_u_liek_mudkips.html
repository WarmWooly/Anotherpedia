  <h1>i herd u liek mudkips</h1>
  <div>"i herd u liek mudkips" is a mid- to late-2000s internet meme phrase originating on deviantART and 4chan regarding the Pokémon (fictional species) Mudkip. There are mixed accounts on which of the two sites the meme started. In October 2004, the group <<link(src=https://www.deviantart.com/mudkipclub(text=MudKipClublink>> was formed, with the owner of the group posting the phrase "so i herd u like mudkips" to others in early 2005. In 2005, a copypasta from 4chan describing a kid spontaneously humping a Mudkip stuffed animal when prompted used the phrase "So I heard you like Mudkips..." for comedic effect.<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/2lajkf/origins_of_so_i_herd_u_liek_mudkipz(text=refCountref>> Variations typically include various misspellings, such as "mudkipz" and "herd". The lack of grammatical quality enhances the phrase by making it seem derpy.</div>
