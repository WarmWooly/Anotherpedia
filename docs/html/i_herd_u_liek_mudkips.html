There are mixed accounts on which of the two sites the meme started. In October 2004, the group <<link(src=https://www.deviantart.com/mudkipclub(text=MudKipClublink>> was formed, with the owner of the group posting the phrase "so i herd u like mudkips" to others in early 2005. <<img(src=git/i herd u liek mudkips copypasta.jpg(cap=The copypasta from 4chan.img>>In 2005, a [[copypasta]] from 4chan describing a kid spontaneously humping a Mudkip [[stuffed animal]] when prompted used the phrase "So I heard you like Mudkips..." for comedic effect.<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/2lajkf/origins_of_so_i_herd_u_liek_mudkipz(text=refCountref>> Variations typically include various misspellings, such as "mudkipz" and "herd". The lack of [[grammatical quality]] enhances the phrase by making it seem [[derpy]].</div>
