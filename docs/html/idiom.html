  <h1>Idiom</h1>
  <div>An idiom is a string of word not made to be taken literal, and which require prior knowledge to discern a meaning from. There are many different idioms, such as to "Spill the beans" or to "Let the cat out of the bag", used to describe revealing information that was meant to be secret. Idioms that can no longer be given a traceable origin are known as dead metaphor.</div>
