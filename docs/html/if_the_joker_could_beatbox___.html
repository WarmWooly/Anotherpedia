      <h1>IF THE JOKER COULD BEATBOX...</h1>
      <div>"IF THE JOKER COULD BEATBOX..." is a YouTube video made by 80Fitz on December 14, 2017, with 80Fitz beatboxing as if he was the Joker. The video is 1 minute and 25 seconds in length. The audio of the beatboxing, especially the section where 80Fitz blends laughing and beatboxing, became incorporated in the Why so serious? Jonkler beatbox meme in August 2024 on TikTok and YouTube Shorts.</div>
