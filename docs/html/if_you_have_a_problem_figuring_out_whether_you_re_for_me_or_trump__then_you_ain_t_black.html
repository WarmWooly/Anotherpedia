      <h1>If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black</h1>
      <div>"If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black" is a quote from Joe Biden on an interview with Charlamagne tha God on The Breakfast Club on May 22, 2020. He stated this while being the Democrat nominee, being seen as highly controversial. During the interview, Biden noticed on his watch that he was running out of time, prompting Charlamagne to respond that they should do another interview because "we’ve got more questions." Biden responded with "You’ve got more questions? Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black." Following the interview, Biden addressed his comments, apologizing for being a wise guy and that he needs the support from African American votes during the election.

There were many memes spurred from the gaffe from Joe Biden. One of the most popular memes was of the skin color of a person being changed from black to white because they questioned or didn't vote for Biden. Other memes include Biden having braids or being black, Biden removing the 'blackness' from a person, and a change from "If you have a problem..." to another situation (such as "If you own a home, then you ain't black").</div>
