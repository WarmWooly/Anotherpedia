      <h1>Illegals in My Yard</h1>
      <div>"Illegals in My Yard" (originally "The Illegal Alien Christmas Song") is a racist parody of the Christmas song "Feliz Navidad (song)" produced by Matt Fox and A.J. Rice of the talk radio The Fox and Rice Experience in late-2009. It sprung back up in popularity in 2023 through TikTok due to its offensive and crass lyrics about immigration to the United States, especially that of Illegal immigration to the United States by Hispanic and Latino Americans.
