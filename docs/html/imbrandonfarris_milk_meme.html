  <h1>Imbrandonfarris milk meme</h1>
  <div>The {{bImbrandonfarris milk meme}} or {{bImbrandonfarris exploding jug}} is a internet meme of the YouTuber Imbrandonfarris using a 5-gallon jug filled with expanding white foam to propel himself backward, to then fall over with himself and the kitchen covered in the foam. The meme originated from a video titled "5 Minute Crafts That Will Ruin Your Day!" posted on January 22, 2021, where Imbrandonfarris attempts to "follow" various 5-minute craft from the YouTube channel 5-Minute Crafts (YouTube channel) to a comedic degree.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tkTxUrsrLA(text=refCountref>>
A clip of a girl sitting on a desk chair popping a balloon from 5-Minute Crafts plays, propelling herself backward with a caption stating "IT WORKS!". Imbrandonfarris, sitting in a desk chair in his kitchen, pops a balloon and remains motionless. He then tries a glitter popper and a confetti popper to no avail. That's when Imbrandonfarris shakes a 5-gallon jug before placing it up against a refrigerator saying "Go big or go home." The foam expands, popping the cap off the jug and propelling Imbrandonfarris slightly backward. He stands from his chair and slips on the foam covering the ground while trying to cover the jug. He manages to prop himself upright and says "Stop it" while he forces the jug closed. A moment later, the jug erupts again before halting. Imbrandonfarris uses a dish rag to wipe foam stuck to the fridge and then reaches for a hand made of soap, asking it "Are you ok?" The scene ends with Imbrandonfarris pointing backward while commenting "Hey, it [the foam] reached the stove."</div>
