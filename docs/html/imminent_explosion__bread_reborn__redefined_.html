      <h1>Imminent Explosion (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
      <div>Imminent explosion is an effect in Minecraft mod Bread Reborn: Redefined that causes an explosion when it ends. The source of imminent explosion is from eating gunpowder bread. Even if the effect ends prematurely, such as by drinking milk, the explosion will still occur. The resistance IV from gunpowder bread greatly reduces dealt damage, making the effect survivable, even when unarmored.</div>
