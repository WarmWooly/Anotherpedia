  <h1>Imminent Explosion (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
  <div>{{bImminent explosion}} is an effect (Minecraft) in {{iMinecraft}} modding (Minecraft) {{iBread Reborn: Redefined}} that causes an explosion (Minecraft) when it ends. The source of imminent explosion is from eating gunpowder bread (Bread Reborn: Redefined). Even if the effect ends prematurely, such as by drinking milk bucket (Minecraft), the explosion will still occur. The resistance (Minecraft) IV from gunpowder bread greatly reduces dealt damage (Minecraft), making the effect survivable, even when unarmored.</div>
