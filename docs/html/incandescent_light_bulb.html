      <h1>Incandescent light bulb</h1>
      <div>An incandescent light bulb is a type of electric light that uses a filament (incandescent light bulb) under joule heating until it becomes incandescent (glowing). The filament is placed in a vacuum or inert gas to prevent oxidation to the filament, connected to terminal (electronics) or another connection, where the socket is used to connect to an electrical output. They were popularization due to the cheap manufacturing cost, little pre-existing infrastructure, and without the need for a regulator (automation). Incandescent light bulbs are notoriously inefficient, with an awful luminous efficacy of 16 lumen/watt for the average 120 volt bulb. Only 5% of the energy put into the bulb is turned into light, with the rest being emitted as heat. They also only last for 1,000 hour, which is leagues behind modern lighting. Due to this, there has been a phase-out of incandescent light bulbs across the Earth.&pThomas Edison was the first to patent his invention of the light bulb on January 27, 1880.</div>
