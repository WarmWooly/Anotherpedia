      <h1>Incandescent light bulb</h1>
      <div>An incandescent light bulb is a type of electric light that uses a filament under heat until it becomes incandescent (glowing). The filament is placed in a vacuum or inert gas to prevent oxidation to the filament, connected to terminals or another connection, where the socket is used to connect to an electrical output. They were popularized due to the cheap manufacturing cost, little pre-existing infrastructure, and without the need for a regulator. Incandescent light bulbs are notoriously inefficient, with an awful luminous efficacy of 16 lm/W for the average 120 V bulb. Only 5% of the energy put into the bulb is turned into light, with the rest being emitted as heat. They also only last for 1,000 hours, which is leagues behind modern lighting. Due to this, there has been a phasing of incandescent light bulbs across the world.<br><br>Thomas Edison was the first to patent his invention of the light bulb on January 27, 1880.</div>
