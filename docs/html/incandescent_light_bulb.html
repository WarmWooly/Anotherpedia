  <h1>Incandescent light bulb</h1>
  <div><<shortElectric light using incandescenceshort>><<img(src=git/light bulb.png(cap=An incandescent light bulb produced by [[Sylvania]].img>>An {{bincandescent light bulb}} is a type of [[electric light]] that uses a [[filament|filament (incandescent light bulb)]] under [[heat|joule heating]] until it becomes [[incandescent]] ([[glowing]]). The filament is placed in a [[vacuum]] or [[inert gas]] to prevent [[oxidation]] to the filament, connected to [[terminals|terminal (electronics)]] or another connection, where the socket is used to connect to an electrical output. They were [[popularized|popularization]] due to the cheap [[manufacturing cost]], little pre-existing infrastructure, and without the need for a [[regulator|regulator (automation)]]. Incandescent light bulbs are notoriously [[inefficient]], with an awful [[luminous efficacy]] of 16 [[lm|lumen]]/[[W|watt]] for the average 120 [[V|volt]] bulb. Only 5% of the [[energy]] put into the bulb is turned into [[light]], with the rest being emitted as [[heat]]. They also only last for 1,000 [[hours|hour]], which is leagues behind modern lighting. Due to this, there has been a [[phasing of incandescent light bulbs|phase-out of incandescent light bulbs]] across the [[world|Earth]].&p[[Thomas Edison]] was the [[first]] to [[patent]] his [[invention]] of the light bulb on January 27, 1880.</div>
