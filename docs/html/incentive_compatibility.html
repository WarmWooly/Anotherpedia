      <h1>Incentive compatibility</h1>
      <div>Incentive compatibility refers to when being honest will result in a better, or not worse, outcome compared to being dishonest. By telling the truth or acting in a manner that is positive, the participant will be better off regardless of what others do. An example would be a person looking for mattresses with little money and a mattress store trying to reduce their stock. It would be beneficial for the person to look for a cheap mattress and for the mattress store to discount their mattresses, allowing both sides to win.</div>
