      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Industrial belts are a type of item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. There are 8 unique industrial belts; 2 that can be crafted and 6 that can be maille crafted. Belts that are more expensive are faster than cheaper belts and have increased durability.

Kelp and leather industrial belts can be crafted using 4 dried kelp/leather (place material in the shape of a ring). Crafting one of these industrial belts will award the advancement Slow But Steady.

Industrial belts (besides kelp and leather) can be created through maille crafting with the setting "Industrial Belt". Industrial belts take 256 chain links to craft. Crafting the copper, iron, or gold chainmail industrial belt will award the advancement Upgrades, People, Upgrades! and crafting the iron chainmail composite industrial belt will award the advancement Gotta Go Fast.

Crafting/melding usage information about industrial belts are located within each specific industrial belt's page.

The main use for industrial belts is to run a variety of machines introduced in Not Lazy Chainmail. This includes:<br>Auto Mailler<br>Auto Snipper<br>Auto Winder<br>Belt Generator<br>Chain Generator<br>Cobblestone Generator<br>Conveyor Warper<br>Crusher<br>Item Aggregator<br>Melder<br>Recycler<br>Winding Jig

An industrial belt can be crushed into an unfinished chainmail project containing 256 chain links.

An industrial belt can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining two of the same industrial belts will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the industrial belts, costing experience.

Industrial belts can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, and Curse of Vanishing using an enchanted book on an anvil. Industrial belts cannot be enchanted in an enchanting table.

The rune Automated Permanence Rune can be cast on industrial belts to give Automated Permanence (unbreakable), costing 2 levels.</div>
