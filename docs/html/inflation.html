      <h1>Inflation</h1>
      <div>For the increase in the cost of goods and services, see economic inflation.<br>Inflation is the action of filling an expandable object (a tire or a balloon) with a gas or liquid (air or water). Inflation can also be used to describe as an increase of a value or an exaggeration. Inflation is often used to describe the increase of price for goods and services. The reverse of inflation is deflation. When the inflation is drastic, it is known as hyperinflation.</div>
