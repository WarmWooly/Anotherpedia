  <h1>Investment Tag ({{iBalatro}})</h1>
  <div><<shortDelayed money-earning Tag in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/investment tag balatro.png(cap=The Investment Tag.img>>The {{bInvestment Tag}} is a delayed [[money|money (Balatro)]]-awarding [[Tag|Tags (Balatro)]] in {{i[[Balatro]]}}. Unlike other Tags, which award money instantly, the Investment Tag requires the player to defeat a [[Boss Blind|Boss Blind (Balatro)]] before earning $25 (hence its name). Each Investment Tag will award $25 after the Boss Blind. The Investment Tag is available on [[Ante|Ante (Balatro)]] 1, with a 1{{s-b/15}} chance to get it during the first Ante and a 1{{s-b/24}} chance in each subsequent Ante. The Investment Tag is especially useful during the first Ante, as it can be used to quickly boost the player's [[econ|economy (Balatro)]] to earn more from [[Interest|Interest (Balatro)]] or to buy better cards in [[the Shop|The Shop (Balatro)]]. Its value tends to become more obsolete as the player establishes [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]] and [[Vouchers|Vouchers (Balatro)]] that can earn more money compared to using the Tag.</div>
