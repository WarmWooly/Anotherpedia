      <h1>Investment Tag (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>The Investment Tag is a delayed money-awarding Tag in Balatro. Unlike other Tags, which award money instantly, the Investment Tag requires the player to defeat a Boss Blind before earning $25 (hence its name). Each Investment Tag will award $25 after the Boss Blind. The Investment Tag is available on Ante 1, with a 1s-b/15 chance to get it during the first Ante and a 1s-b/24 chance in each subsequent Ante. The Investment Tag is especially useful during the first Ante, as it can be used to quickly boost the player's econ to earn more from Interest or to buy better cards in the Shop. Its value tends to become more obsolete as the player establishes Jokers and Vouchers that can earn more money compared to using the Tag.</div>
