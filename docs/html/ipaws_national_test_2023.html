      <h1>IPAWS national test 2023</h1>
      <div>On October 4th, 2023, at 2:20 PM EDT in the United States of America, a test of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinated with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was conducted. It was used to ensure that both the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) and the Emergency Alert System (EAS) were functioning correctly. For a 30-minute period after 2:20 PM, all active cell towers sent a single alert to all devices with a provider who are participating to test WEA. An alert will was also sent out to TVs and radios that are also connected for a duration of roughly 1 minute to test EAS. This was the third national test for WEA, and the seventh national test for EAS. If there was a problem due to inclement weather, it would have been postponed to October 11th.</div>
