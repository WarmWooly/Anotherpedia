      <h1>Iron chain (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|6||hardness (Minecraft)|5||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|Yes||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The iron chain (formerly chain) is a block (Minecraft) in Minecraft used in crafting (Minecraft) and as decoration.



Iron chains are often used to act as supports for structure. In The Overworld (Minecraft), iron chains can generate as supports for mineshaft (Minecraft) and for platforms within trial chambers (Minecraft). In The Nether (Minecraft), ruined portal (Minecraft) and the treasure room type bastion remnant (Minecraft) can generate iron chains.

Iron chains can be crafted using 1 iron ingot (Minecraft) and 2 iron nugget (Minecraft) (place the ingot in the middle, then the nuggets above and below).

The chances to find iron chains in chest (Minecraft) are the following (same for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition unless specified):<br>In a bastion remnant (Minecraft), a generic chest has a 24.4% chance of containing 2-10 iron chains.



Iron chains are useful decoration pieces to add a sense of gravity to structures through chain suspension. Despite the appearance, iron chains can't actually suspend blocks or structures in the air, and any gravity-affected blocks (i.e. sand (Minecraft), gravel (Minecraft)) will still fall even if attached to an iron chain. Bell (Minecraft), lantern (Minecraft)/soul lantern (Minecraft), and hanging sign (Minecraft) have unique models that connect up to iron chains. Iron chains can be placed on the X-, Y-, and Z-axes.
