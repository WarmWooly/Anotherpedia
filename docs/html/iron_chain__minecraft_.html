Iron chains are often used to act as supports for structure. In the Overworld, iron chains can generate as supports for mineshafts and for platforms within trial chambers. In the Nether, ruined portals and the treasure room type bastion remnants can generate iron chains.
Iron chains can be crafted using 1 iron ingot and 2 iron nuggets (place the ingot in the middle, then the nuggets above and below).
The chances to find iron chains in chests are the following (same for Bedrock and Java unless specified):&spIn a bastion remnant, a generic chest has a 24.4% chance of containing 2-10 iron chains.
Iron chains are useful decoration pieces to add a sense of gravity to structures through chain suspension. Despite the appearance, iron chains can't actually suspend blocks or structures in the air, and any gravity-affected blocks (i.e. sand, gravel) will still fall even if attached to an iron chain. Bells, lanterns/soul lanterns, and hanging signs have unique models that connect up to iron chains. Iron chains can be placed on the X-, Y-, and Z-axes.
