In [[the Overworld|The Overworld (Minecraft)]], iron chains can generate as supports for [[mineshafts|mineshaft (Minecraft)]] and for platforms within [[trial chambers|trial chambers (Minecraft)]]. In [[the Nether|The Nether (Minecraft)]], [[ruined portals|ruined portal (Minecraft)]] and the treasure room type [[bastion remnants|bastion remnant (Minecraft)]] can generate iron chains.<<hr2Craftinghr2>>Iron chains can be crafted using 1 [[iron ingot|iron ingot (Minecraft)]] and 2 [[iron nuggets|iron nugget (Minecraft)]] (place the ingot in the middle, then the nuggets above and below).<<hr2Chest loothr2>>The chances to find iron chains in [[chests|chest (Minecraft)]] are the following (same for [[Bedrock|Minecraft: Bedrock Edition]] and [[Java|Minecraft: Java Edition]] unless specified):&spIn a [[bastion remnant|bastion remnant (Minecraft)]], a generic chest has a 24.4% chance of containing 2-10 iron chains.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Decorationhr2>>Iron chains are useful decoration pieces to add a sense of gravity to structures through chain suspension. Despite the appearance, iron chains can't actually suspend blocks or structures in the air, and any gravity-affected blocks (i.e. [[sand|sand (Minecraft)]], [[gravel|gravel (Minecraft)]]) will still fall even if attached to an iron chain. [[Bells|Bell (Minecraft)]], [[lanterns|lantern (Minecraft)]]/[[soul lanterns|soul lantern (Minecraft)]], and [[hanging signs|hanging sign (Minecraft)]] have unique models that connect up to iron chains. Iron chains can be placed on the X-, Y-, and Z-axes.<<hr2Craftinghr2>>Iron chains are used in the following crafting recipes:&sp[[Acacia Hanging Sign|Acacia Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped acacia logs|stripped acacia log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Bamboo Hanging Sign|Bamboo Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[block of stripped bamboo|block of stripped bamboo (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Birch Hanging Sign|Birch Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped birch logs|stripped birch log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Cherry Hanging Sign|Cherry Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped cherry logs|stripped cherry log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Crimson Hanging Sign|Crimson Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped crimson stems|stripped crimson stem (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with stems).&sp[[Dark Oak Hanging Sign|Dark Oak Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped dark oak logs|stripped dark oak log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Jungle Hanging Sign|Jungle Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped jungle logs|stripped jungle log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Mangrove Hanging Sign|Mangrove Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped mangrove logs|stripped mangrove log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Oak Hanging Sign|Oak Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped oak logs|stripped oak log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Pale Oak Hanging Sign|Pale Oak Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped pale oak logs|stripped pale oak log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Spruce Hanging Sign|Spruce Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped spruce logs|stripped spruce log (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with logs).&sp[[Warped Hanging Sign|Warped Hanging Sign (Minecraft)]] x6 - 2 iron chains and 6 [[stripped warped stems|stripped warped stem (Minecraft)]] (place the chains in the top left and right corners, fill the bottom two rows with stems).</div>
