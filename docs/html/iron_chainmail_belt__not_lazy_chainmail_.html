      <h1>Iron Chainmail Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Slot|Belt||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The iron chainmail belt is a belt curio in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail that buffs the wearer while sneaking.



The iron chainmail belt can be created through maille crafting with the settings "Iron Belt". The belt takes 128 iron chain links to craft.

Journeyman-level chainmaillers have a 50% chance to trade 3 emeralds for 1 iron chainmail belt.



When the iron chainmail belt is worn in a belt slot and the wearer is sneaking, they will gain the effects Speed I and Strength I. The Speed and Strength will increase depending on the number of chainmail armor pieces (chainmail helmet, chainmail chestplate, chainmail leggings, and chainmail boots) the wearer has equipped. With 2 armor pieces equipped, the effects given are Speed II and Strength II, and with all 4 armor pieces equipped, the effect given is Speed III and Strength III.

Iron chainmail belts can be crushed into unfinished iron chainmail projects containing 128 chain links.</div>
