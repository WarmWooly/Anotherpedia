      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Slot|Bracelet||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The iron chainmail bracelet is a bracelet curio in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail that gives the wearer Resistance.



The iron chainmail bracelet can be created through maille crafting with the settings "Iron Bracelet". The bracelet takes 64 iron chain links to craft.

Journeyman-level chainmaillers have a 50% chance to trade 1 emerald for 1 iron chainmail bracelet.

Iron chainmail bracelets have a 3.85% chance of being found in suspicious sand within chainmail ruins.



When the iron chainmail bracelet is worn in a bracelet slot, it will give the wearer the effect Resistance I until removed. The Resistance will increase depending on the number of chainmail armor pieces (chainmail helmet, chainmail chestplate, chainmail leggings, and chainmail boots) the wearer has equipped. With 2 armor pieces equipped, the effect given is Resistance II, and with all 4 armor pieces equipped, the effect given is Resistance III.

Iron chainmail bracelets can be crushed into unfinished iron chainmail projects containing 64 chain links.
