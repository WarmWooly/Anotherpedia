      <h1>Iron Chainmail Necklace (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Slot|Necklace||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The iron chainmail necklace is a necklace curio in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail that reflects damage dealt to the wearer back to the attacker. The wearer still takes damage as well.



The iron chainmail necklace can be created through maille crafting with the settings "Iron Necklace". The necklace takes 128 iron chain links to craft.

Journeyman-level chainmaillers have a 50% chance to trade 2 emeralds for 1 iron chainmail necklace.

Iron chainmail necklaces have a 3.85% chance of being found in suspicious sand within chainmail ruins.



When the iron chainmail necklace is worn in a necklace slot, damage dealt to the wearer will be reflected back onto the attacker based on the number of Not Lazy Chainmail advancements the wearer has obtained. The way reflected damage is calculated is through codedamage dealt * (advancements * 0.05). For example, if the wearer has 10 advancements and takes 8 damage, they will reflect 4 damage back to the attacker.<<note(content=code8 * (10 * 0.05) = 8 * 0.5 = 4(text=noteCountnote>> If the damage is from a player, the damage reflected is divided by 5 (only 1% per advancement). As there are a total of 50 advancements in Not Lazy Chainmail, the wearer can reflect back as much as 250% of the attacker's damage (50% from players). The wearer will still be dealt the normal amount of damage.

Iron chainmail necklaces can be crushed into unfinished iron chainmail projects containing 128 chain links.
