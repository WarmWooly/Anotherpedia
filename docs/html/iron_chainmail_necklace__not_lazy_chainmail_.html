The way reflected damage is calculated is through {{codedamage dealt * (advancements * 0.05)}}. For example, if the wearer has 10 advancements and takes 8 damage, they will reflect 4 damage back to the attacker.<<note(content={{code8 * (10 * 0.05) = 8 * 0.5 = 4}}(text=noteCountnote>> If the damage is from a [[player|player (Minecraft)]], the damage reflected is divided by 5 (only 1% per advancement). As there are a total of 50 advancements in {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}}, the wearer can reflect back as much as 250% of the attacker's damage (50% from players). The wearer will still be dealt the normal amount of damage.<<hr2Crushinghr2>>Iron chainmail necklaces can be [[crushed|Crusher (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] into [[unfinished iron chainmail projects|unfinished iron chainmail project (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] containing 128 [[chain links|iron chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)]].<<hrOld textureshr>>{{gal<<img(src=git/iron chainmail necklace nlc.png(cap=The [[texture|texture (Minecraft)]] for an iron chainmail necklace before [[1.1.10|Not Lazy Chainmail 1.1.10]].(galleryImgimg>>}}</div>
