      <h1>Iron Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The iron coil is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to be snipped into iron chain links.



When an iron wire or (bright) spool or material is wound in a winding jig or auto winder, an iron coil is created. While wires only give one coil, spools give back 10. Spools are ~11% more efficient than wires when being winded into coils.

Novice-level chainmaillers have a 22.22% chance to trade 1 iron wire and 1 emerald for 1 iron coil.

The chances to find an iron coil in chests are the following:&spIn a chainmailler home, a chest has a 51.77% chance to contain an iron coil.<<note(content=The chainmailler home has a double chest, both rolling loot tables with 1--3 rolls (on average, 2) that contains a 1 in 6 chance to select an iron coil. The chance for at least 1 iron coil to be inside the double chest is calculated as code1 - (5/6)s-u4 = 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.(text=noteCountnote>>



Main page: Snipping (aiNot Lazy Chainmail)&spPliers can be used to snip the iron coil into iron chain links of the same material. An iron coil can be snipped 64 times, creating a stack of iron chain links. Better pliers decrease the snips required to harvest all the chain links from a coil. The auto snipper can be used to automate the process of snipping.</div>
