      <h1>Iron Composite Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|640||Enchantability (Minecraft)|4||Attack damage (Minecraft)|2||Attack speed (Minecraft)|1||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Iron composite pliers are an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used for snipping chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail) from coil (Not Lazy Chainmail) and unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Iron composite pliers can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 block of iron composite chains (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 2 obsidian (Minecraft) (place the block in the middle, then the iron composite above and to the right, and the obisidan to the bottom and the left).



Hold the iron composite pliers in the offhand (Minecraft) with the coil or unfinished project to be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) in the main hand (Minecraft). To remove a chain from the coil/unfinished project, right-click anywhere. This will use the pliers and create four chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type. When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.

The Auto Snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting the iron composite pliers, an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The iron composite pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.

Iron composite pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Iron composite pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 tick (Minecraft)).

Iron composite pliers can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining iron composite pliers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the iron composite pliers, costing experience.

Iron composite pliers can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).

Multiple runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast onto iron composite pliers:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3 levels|I||Dampen Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Dampened (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|I||Muffle Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Muffled (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|Itable>></div>
