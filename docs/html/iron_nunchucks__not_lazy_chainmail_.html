      <h1>Iron Nunchucks (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|300||Enchantability|14||Attack damage|4||Attack speed|5||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Noinfo>>Iron nunckucks are a weapon in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail, mainly used for landing quick attacks with little cooldown.



Iron nunchucks can be crafted with 1 iron tool chain, 4 iron nuggets, and 2 sticks (nuggets go in all four corners, the sticks to the left and right, and the tool chain on the bottom).



Iron nunchucks are made for quick jabs, with each attack costing 2 durability. Iron nunchucks deal 4 damage and have an attack cooldown of 4 (0.2 seconds or 4 ticks).

Iron nunchucks can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining iron nunchucks will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the iron nunchucks, costing experience.

Iron nunchucks can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Vanishing, Disorient, Train, and Defend using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking, Disorient, Train, and Defend may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

Multiple runes can be cast onto iron nunchucks:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Experienced Rune|Experienced|r10 levels|III||Locating Rune|Locating|r2 levels|I||Shatter Rune|Shatter|r4 levels|I||Shuffle Rune|Shuffle|r6 levels|I||Tracking Rune|Tracking|r3 levels|Itable>>
