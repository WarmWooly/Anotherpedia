      <h1>Iron Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|64||Enchantability|2||Attack damage|2||Attack speed|1||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Noinfo>>Iron pliers are an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used for snipping chain links from coils and unfinished projects.



Iron pliers can be crafted with 2 iron ingots, 1 plank, and 2 sticks (place the planks in the middle, then the iron above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left).

The chances to find iron pliers in chests are the following:<br>In a chainmailler home, a chest has a 91% chance to contain iron pliers (36% chance for it to be enchanted).



Hold the iron pliers in the offhand with the coil or unfinished project to be snipped in the main hand. To remove a chain from the coil/unfinished project, right-click anywhere. This will use the pliers and create one chain link of the coil's/unfinished project's material type. When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.

The Auto Snipper is a block that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting the iron pliers, an industrial belt, and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The iron pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.

Iron pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Iron pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 ticks).

Iron pliers can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining iron pliers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the iron pliers, costing experience.

Iron pliers can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, and Curse of Vanishing, using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

The rune Automated Permanence Rune can be cast on iron pliers to give Automated Permanence (unbreakable), costing 2 levels.</div>
