Iron pliers can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 iron ingot (Minecraft), 1 planks (Minecraft), and 2 stick (Minecraft) (place the planks in the middle, then the iron above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left).
The chances to find iron pliers in chest (Minecraft) are the following:&spIn a chainmailler home (Not Lazy Chainmail), a chest has a 91% chance to contain iron pliers (36% chance for it to be enchantment (Minecraft)).<<note(content=The chainmailler home has a double chest, both rolling loot table (Minecraft) with 1 roll that contains a 7 in 10 chance to select iron pliers (2 in 10, or 1 in 5, for enchanted). The chance for at least 1 pair of iron pliers to be inside the double chest is calculated as {{code1 - (3/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91}} ({{code1 - (8/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36}} for enchanted).(text=noteCountnote>>
Hold the iron pliers in the offhand (Minecraft) with the coil or unfinished project to be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) in the main hand (Minecraft). To remove a chain from the coil/unfinished project, right-click anywhere. This will use the pliers and create one chain link of the coil's/unfinished project's material type. When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.
The Auto Snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting the iron pliers, an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The iron pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.
Iron pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Iron pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 tick (Minecraft)).
Iron pliers can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining iron pliers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the iron pliers, costing experience.
Iron pliers can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).
The runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast on iron pliers to give Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail) (unbreakable), costing 2 experience (Minecraft).</div>
