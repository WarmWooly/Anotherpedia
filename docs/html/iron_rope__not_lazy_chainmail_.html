      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|2.5||hardness (Minecraft)|0.2/1 (head/body)||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|Yes||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The iron rope is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail that can be placed to create a climbable structure.
The iron rope can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 iron tool chain (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 chain (Minecraft), and 1 iron ingot (Minecraft) (place the tool chain in the middle, chain below, and iron above; makes 4).
The iron rope, when placed, will create an iron head connected to a block. The body of the rope will then start to automatically extend downward as far as it can go before hitting another block. When the body is broken or destroyed, it will be replaced. If the body is displaced (such as using a piston (Minecraft)), the body will disappear. The only way to remove the rope is to break or destroy the head of the rope. The head can be pushed around without issue, allowing for automatic rope ladders to be constructed. If the block the head is connected to is broken, it will connect to another adjacent block. If all blocks adjacent to the head are broken, it will break and drop as an item (Minecraft entity).
Main page: Chain Launcher ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}&spWhen held in the offhand, the iron rope can be launched from a Chain Launcher (Not Lazy Chainmail). When the rope impacts a block, it will be placed, automatically extending downward. This allows the user to launch a rope up much further than the range the rope can be placed, creating a climbable path upwards. When the rope hits a mob (Minecraft), it will deal damage to it and drop as an item (Minecraft entity).
Iron ropes can be Crusher (Not Lazy Chainmail) into unfinished iron chainmail project (Not Lazy Chainmail) containing 50 iron chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail).</div>
