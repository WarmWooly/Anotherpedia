The body of the rope will then start to automatically extend downward as far as it can go before hitting another block. When the body is broken or destroyed, it will be replaced. If the body is displaced (such as using a [[piston|piston (Minecraft)]]), the body will disappear. The only way to remove the rope is to break or destroy the head of the rope. The head can be pushed around without issue, allowing for automatic rope ladders to be constructed. If the block the head is connected to is broken, it will connect to another adjacent block. If all blocks adjacent to the head are broken, it will break and drop as an [[item|item (Minecraft entity)]].<<hr2Launchinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Chain Launcher ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail}})]]}}&spWhen held in the offhand, the iron rope can be launched from a [[chain launcher|Chain Launcher (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]. When the rope impacts a block, it will be placed, automatically extending downward. This allows the user to launch a rope up much further than the range the rope can be placed, creating a climbable path upwards. When the rope hits a [[mob|mob (Minecraft)]], it will deal damage to it and drop as an [[item|item (Minecraft entity)]].<<hr2Crushinghr2>>Iron ropes can be [[crushed|Crusher (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] into [[unfinished iron chainmail projects|unfinished iron chainmail project (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] containing 50 [[chain links|iron chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail)]].</div>
