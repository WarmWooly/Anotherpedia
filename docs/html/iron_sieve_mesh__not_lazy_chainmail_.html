      <h1>Iron Sieve Mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The iron sieve mesh is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used for sieving blocks into various resources. As the iron sieve mesh is the lowest tier, it will mostly get small quantities of common items; however, it does have some sieving drops specific to its tier.



The iron sieve mesh can be crafted with 1 iron chain carpet and 8 sticks (place the carpet in the center and surround with sticks).



For the sieving loot table and applicable blocks, see sieving (aiNot Lazy Chainmail).<br>Hold the iron sieve mesh in the offhand with the block to be sieved in the main hand. Upon using the iron sieve mesh, the block will be consumed, and any items collected will be placed in the inventory or on the ground if there is not enough space.

The Sieve Dropper is a block that can be used to automatically sieve items that pass above on a chain conveyor. By inputting the iron sieve mesh, the valid blocks will automatically be sieved and dropped below. The iron sieve mesh will still lose durability while in a sieve dropper.

An iron sieve mesh can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, and Curse of Vanishing, using an enchanted book on an anvil.

Multiple runes can be cast onto iron sieve meshes:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Automated Permanence Rune|Automated Permanence|r3 levels|I||Separation Rune|Separation|r5 levels|II||Quick Erosion Rune|Quick Erosion|r3 levels|Itable>></div>
