      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The iron sieve mesh is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used for sieving (Not Lazy Chainmail) block (Minecraft) into various resources. As the iron sieve mesh is the lowest tier, it will mostly get small quantities of common items; however, it does have some sieving drops specific to its tier.
The iron sieve mesh can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 iron chain carpet (Not Lazy Chainmail) and 8 stick (Minecraft) (place the carpet in the center and surround with sticks).
For the sieving loot table and applicable blocks, see sieving ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}&spHold the iron sieve mesh in the offhand (Minecraft) with the block to be sieved in the main hand (Minecraft). Upon using the iron sieve mesh, the block will be consumed, and any items collected will be placed in the inventory (Minecraft) or on the ground if there is not enough space.
The Sieve Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically sieve items that pass above on a chain conveyor (Not Lazy Chainmail). By inputting the iron sieve mesh, the valid blocks will automatically be sieved and dropped below. The iron sieve mesh will still lose durability while in a sieve dropper.
An iron sieve mesh can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft).
