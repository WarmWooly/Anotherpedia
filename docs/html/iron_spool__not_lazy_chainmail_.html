Iron spools can be crafted with 1 empty spool and 8 iron ingots (place the spool in the middle and surround it with the ingots).

Iron spools can be obtained when a Crusher crushes iron spool blocks.

A bright iron spool can be smoked in a smoker to produce an iron spool, taking 1 second.



Iron spools are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Iron Spool Block - 1 iron spool and 2 wooden slabs (place the spool in the middle and place the slabs above and below it).

Iron spools can be used on a winding jig or in an auto winder to be turned into 10 iron coils. The iron spool has a malleability of 640, requiring the following number of turns based on the industrial belt used:<<tableBelt|Turns||Kelp|r640||Leather|r640||Copper|r320||Iron|r214||Gold|r160||Rose Gold|r80||Netherite|r40||Iron Composite|r20table>>
