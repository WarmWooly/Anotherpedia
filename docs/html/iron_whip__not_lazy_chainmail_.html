The iron whip can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 iron tool chain (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 leather (Minecraft), and 1 stick (Minecraft) (place the leather in the middle, the stick in the bottom left, and the tool chain in the top right).
The iron whip is made for fast attacks, with each attack costing 2 durability. The iron whip deals 5 damage and has an attack cooldown of 2 (0.5 seconds or 10 tick (Minecraft)).
Iron whips can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining iron whips will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the two iron whips, costing experience.
