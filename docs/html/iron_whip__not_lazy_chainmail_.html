      <h1>Iron Whip (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|600||Enchantability|14||Attack damage|5||Attack speed|2||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Noinfo>>The iron whip are a weapon in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail, mainly used for its faster attack speed and unique enchantments.



The iron whip can be crafted with 1 iron tool chain, 1 leather, and 1 stick (place the leather in the middle, the stick in the bottom left, and the tool chain in the top right).



The iron whip is made for fast attacks, with each attack costing 2 durability. The iron whip deals 5 damage and has an attack cooldown of 2 (0.5 seconds or 10 ticks).

Iron whips can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining iron whips will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the two iron whips, costing experience.

Iron whips can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Vanishing, Life Lash, Launch, Ignite, and Dissolve using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking, Life Lash, Launch, Ignite, and Dissolve may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

Multiple runes can be cast onto iron whips:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Experienced Rune|Experienced|r10 levels|III||Laceration Rune|Laceration|r5 levels|I||Locating Rune|Locating|r2 levels|I||Tracking Rune|Tracking|r3 levels|Itable>>

Iron whips can be crushed into an iron tool chain.</div>
