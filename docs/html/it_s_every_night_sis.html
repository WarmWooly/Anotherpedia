      <h1>It's Every Night Sis</h1>
      <div>"It's Every Night Sis" is a single (music) by Bryan Quang Le (known as RiceGum), with vocals from Alissa Violet. It was released on June 9, 2017, being a answering song to the diss track made by Jake Paul "It's Everyday Bro", which was released only several days prior. The music video was released the same day.<br><br>After having an on-and-off relationship with Jake Paul, Paul broke up with Violet and kicked her out of the influencer house for Team 10, where Paul then started a relationship with Terra Brooks. They both accused each other of cheating (relationship) with other people.<br><br>"It's Every Night Sis" was not received well by critic due to the personal attacks made toward Jake Paul in the song. It was somewhat popular to the public, however, due to the hate generated toward Jake Paul. The song is considered a platinum under the RIAA certification.</div>
