      <h1>It's Everyday Bro</h1>
      <div>"It's Everyday Bro" is a single released by Jake Paul and the group Team 10, with Nick Crompton, Chance Sutton, Ivan and Emilio Martinez, and Tessa Brooks. It was released on May 30, 2017, with the music video following the same day.&pThe song is a diss track on Paul's former girlfriend Alissa Violet, who released a song in response titled "It's Every Night Sis". The song was produced after Paul kicked Violet out of the influencer house Team 10 resided in as he started a relationship with Tessa Brooks. There's been accusations that Violet cheated on Paul with someone else, and that Paul cheated on Violet with Brooks while still in a relationship with Violet. Logan Paul, Jake Paul's brother, personally disapproved and criticized the song.
The song was received poorly by critics and the public alike. The video on YouTube obtained over 5.4 million dislikes, making it one of the most disliked videos on the platform. It's lack of consistency and coherence throughout the song, alongside lyrics such as "England is my city", aided in its poor performance. It was only dug further by the turn of the year with the suicide forest controversy about Logan Paul. The song is considered a platinum under the RIAA certification.</div>
