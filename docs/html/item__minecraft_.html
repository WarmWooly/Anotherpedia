  <h1>Item (Minecraft)</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the entity (Minecraft) created when an item is dropped into the world, see item ({{aiMinecraft}} entity).}}&spAn {{bitem}} in {{iMinecraft}} is a form of object that can be contained in an inventory (Minecraft) (such as in a player (Minecraft) or chest (Minecraft)), held in an item frame or on an armor stand, or dropped on the ground as an entity (Minecraft).&pItems are the form most materials will exist within the world, such as a stick (Minecraft) or a sword (Minecraft). Other items may also have respective block (Minecraft) forms, as with dirt (Minecraft) and cobblestone (Minecraft), which can be placed in the world. Items can create entities, including boat (Minecraft) and minecart (Minecraft). Items may act as tool (Minecraft) or weapon (Minecraft), breaking blocks faster, dealing more damage, or launching projectile (Minecraft). Items may also have different unique behaviors not mentioned here, for example, the spyglass (Minecraft) being used to zoom in on distant objects. Items can be obtained through a wide variety of means, such as mining (Minecraft) a block, killing a mob (Minecraft), crafting (Minecraft), or looting a structure (Minecraft). Items can be stacked with other items of the same type, which is done automatically, up to 64 (16 for select items, i.e. snowball (Minecraft)). Some items cannot be stacked (items with durability (Minecraft), bed (Minecraft), potion (Minecraft), etc).</div>
