      <h1>ItsGabe is the Ruler of Everything</h1>
      <div>"ItsGabe is the Ruler of Everything" is a video on YouTube by ItsGabe posted on May 16, 2024. The video features various clips from prior content with lyrics overlayed in the font Impact. The beginning and end of the video, however, are live action. The song played during the video is Tally Hall's 2008 re-release of "Ruler of Everything".<br><br>The thumbnail of the video seems to take inspiration from the music video for "Ruler of Everything". At the song's beginning of the music video, the entire scene is black and white, with objects and people comprised of dots and lines. This style was used to depict ItsGabe's penguin character standing on a surface under a starry sky, similar to the ambiguous humanoid-looking 2D-drawn lifeforms at the start of the music video.</div>
