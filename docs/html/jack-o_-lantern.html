Jack-o'-lanterns originated from [[Irish|Ireland]] traditions, though are now used as decorations seen during [[October]] to celebrate [[Halloween]].&pHistorically, jack-o'-lanterns were used by the Irish to ward off evil spirits, inspired by the story of [[Stingy Jack]]. The story is about a man named Jack, whose spirit cannot go to [[heaven]] or [[hell]], and wanders with his only light being a burning [[coal]] inside a carved [[turnip]]. People would carve scary faces into [[vegetables|vegetable]] like turnips or [[potatoes|potato]] to scare off evil spirits and guide Jack's soul on his path. When the Irish had brought this tradition to the [[US|America]], they would instead use pumpkins, which were more accessible at the time.</div>
