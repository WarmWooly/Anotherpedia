      <h1>Jack-o'-lantern</h1>
      <div>For the AR mobile app, see Jack-O'LantARn.<br>A jack-o'-lantern is a decorative lantern, usually made of a hollowed out pumpkin, with a face or other design carved into it and a light placed inside. Jack-o'-lanterns originated from Irish traditions, though are now used as decorations seen during October to celebrate Halloween.<br><br>Historically, jack-o'-lanterns were used by the Irish to ward off evil spirits, inspired by the story of Stingy Jack. The story is about a man named Jack, whose spirit cannot go to heaven or hell, and wanders with his only light being a burning coal inside a carved turnip. People would carve scary faces into vegetables like turnips or potatoes to scare off evil spirits and guide Jack's soul on his path. When the Irish had brought this tradition to the US, they would instead use pumpkins, which were more accessible at the time.</div>
