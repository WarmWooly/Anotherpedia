      <h1>Jack (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Jack is a rank of playing cards in Balatro that is worth 10 Chips when played without Modifiers or Jokers. Jacks are considered to be a face card. The Abandoned Deck removes all face cards, so Jack can't be drawn without modifying the deck. The Erratic Deck randomly selects ranks, so Jacks may be more or less likely depending on the selected ranks. The following are Jokers that Jack can trigger because of its rank:<<tableJoker|Effect||Scary Face|+30 Chips||Business Card|1 in 2 chance to earn $1 when scored||Ride the Bus|Resets the Joker's Mult when scored||Faceless Joker|When 3 face cards are discarded, earn $5||Midas Mask|Scoring face cards become Gold Cards||Photograph|First face card gives X2 Mult||Reserved Parking|1 in 2 chance to earn $1 when held in hand||Smiley Face|+5 Mult||Sock and Buskin|Retriggers card||Hit the Road|Every discarded Jack adds x0.5 Mult until the round ends||Caino|Gains x1 Mult per face card destroyedtable>><br>Mail-In Rebate allows the player to earn $5 on discard with the rank randomly selected at the start of the round, including Jack. The Idol gives x2 Mult when a card of a randomly selected rank and suit is played, including Jacks of any suit.

There are various methods to obtain cards with the rank Jack, including:;;Standard Packs|Cards bought in the Shop with the Voucher Magic Trick|The Tarot Card Strength used on 10s|The Spectral Card Familiar (destroys 1 card; creates 3 random enhanced face cards)*|The Spectral Card Ouija (randomly turns entire hand into a single rank, -1 hand size)*|The Spectral Card Cryptid (creates 2 copies of a selected card)|The Marble Joker (creates a randomly-ranked Stone Card when a Blind is selected; requires the Enhancement to be replaced or removed)*|The Joker DNA (if the first hand is a single card, creates a permanent copy and adds it to the deck)|The Joker Certificate (creates a playing card with a random Seal)*;;*These methods randomly select a rank and may not provide a Jack</div>
