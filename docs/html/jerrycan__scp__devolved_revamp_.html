      <h1>Jerrycan (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Jerrycan is a primary tool within SCP: Devolved Revamp for the Maintenance Staff (SCP: Devolved Revamp) that is used to refuel the Generator Room (SCP: Devolved Revamp). Jerrycans are located in the generator room, which is in Sector 1 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp). Jerrycans can be used by an MS, grabbing a can in the generator room and walking up to the generator, then holding the prompt button down for 10 seconds. Once that has been done, the generator will refuel by 5% and the jerrycan will be removed. If the generator loses power, it cannot be refueled for 10 minutes until power comes back online.</div>
