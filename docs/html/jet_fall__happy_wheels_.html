      <h1>Jet Fall (Happy Wheels)</h1>
      <div>See also: Ball Fall ({{aiHappy Wheels)}}&spA Jet Fall is a level genre within Happy Wheels where the player attempts to reach the bottom of the level while falling through many jets. The main challenge comes from the player avoiding their body being torn apart by jets mid-fall, especially as jets become more powerful closer to the finish line placed on the bottom. Other dangers in jet falls include being flung outside the containing walls, hitting other obstacles (such as a spike set), or getting slammed into a wall by jets. The jets are often put as separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses.&pSegway Guy is the most used character used for Jet Falls, with Pogo Stick Man also used. It's not uncommon for Jet Falls to force the character to be off their vehicle (segway or pogo stick) to prevent them from being used as a shield from the jets. Lost limbs can also be used to trigger jets, clearing out a path to the bottom without the player being flung into the air. Spreading out can trigger more jets at the risk of getting caught on one and being flung away while balling up reduces the jets hit and movement options.</div>
