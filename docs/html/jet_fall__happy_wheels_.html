The main challenge comes from the player avoiding their body being torn apart by jets mid-fall, especially as jets become more powerful closer to the [[finish line|finish line (Happy Wheels)]] placed on the bottom. Other dangers in jet falls include being flung outside the containing walls, hitting other obstacles (such as a [[spike set|spike set (Happy Wheels)]]), or getting slammed into a wall by jets. The jets are often put as separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses.&p[[Segway Guy|Segway Guy (Happy Wheels)]] is the most used [[character|characters (Happy Wheel)]] used for Jet Falls, with [[Pogo Stick Man|Pogo Stick Man (Happy Wheels)]] also used. It's not uncommon for Jet Falls to force the character to be off their vehicle (segway or pogo stick) to prevent them from being used as a shield from the jets. Lost limbs can also be used to trigger jets, clearing out a path to the bottom without the player being flung into the air. Spreading out can trigger more jets at the risk of getting caught on one and being flung away while balling up reduces the jets hit and movement options.</div>
