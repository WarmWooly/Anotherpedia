Shiny Jigglypuffs are a light purple instead of pink.<br><br>Jigglypuff is a direct portmanteau of jiggly and puff.

Jigglypuff is able to easily inflate like a balloon, having a massive lung capacity. It's said that looking into a Jigglypuff's eyes can be mesmerizing. It will sing between 0.5 and 4 Hz to match delta waves in the brain, which is often associated with deep sleep, with the ability to sing in over 12 octaves to best suit the case. There have been cases where a Jigglypuff dies of asphyxiation while trying to cause an opponent to fall asleep.

A Jigglypuff has a 25/75 chance to be male or female.
