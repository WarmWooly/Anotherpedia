      <h1>Jigglypuff</h1>
      <div>Jigglypuff is a puffball-like Normal and Fairy type Pokémon from the first generation.
Jigglypuff resembles a pink ball. It has a pair of triangular ears with black insides, alongside a pair of small arms and flat feet. Its face consists of two large blue eyes and a smaller mouth in the center. A curled piece of fur rests above its face, acting similarly to hair.&pJigglypuff's official size is 1 ft and 8 in., while weighing 12.1 lbs. Shiny Jigglypuffs are a light purple instead of pink.&pJigglypuff is a direct portmanteau of jiggly and puff.
Jigglypuff is able to easily inflate like a balloon, having a massive lung capacity. It's said that looking into a Jigglypuff's eyes can be mesmerizing. It will sing between 0.5 and 4 Hz to match delta waves in the brain, which is often associated with deep sleep, with the ability to sing in over 12 octaves to best suit the case. There have been cases where a Jigglypuff dies of asphyxiation while trying to cause an opponent to fall asleep.
A Jigglypuff has a 25/75 chance to be male or female. Jigglypuff is the 39th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color pink.&pJigglypuff evolves from Igglybuff, which can then evolve when exposed to a Moon Stone into Wigglypuff.&pIn the sixth generation, Jigglypuff's type was changed from Normal type to Normal and Fairy type.</div>
