  <h1>John Oliver's snake</h1>
  <div>John Oliver's snake was a reoccurring bit (comedy) in Season 11 (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver) episode 9 of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver titled "UFOs (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver)" where John Oliver lost his snake. It starts with a video clip of Mark O'Connell on WTTV in 2017 stating that the United States Air Force doesn't want to seem incompetent by not being able to explain a UFO, with Oliver trying not to look incompetent to the audience discussing the pet snake that he lost while bringing out an empty snake container. He then brings up his snake for another joke later in the segment, until culminating in the finale where a snake is found in front of Oliver's desk, but it isn't Oliver's snake. The snake's species hasn't been confirmed, but it has been guessed to most likely be the California kingsnake by fans.
The first occurrence starts roughly around halfway through the episode:&p[From a clip from WTTV in 2017]&spMark O'Connell: You can cover up knowing something, or you can cover up not knowing something, and I think it's- it's just as likely that the Air Force is covering up not knowing anything.&spUnidentified Host: Why would they do that?&spMark O'Connell: Because they can't- they can't afford to look incompetent. They can't admit to the public that they don't know what these things are in our sky.&sp[The clip ends, showing John Oliver off to the right as he begins speaking]&spJohn Oliver: That John C. Reilly character makes a good point there. When you're in charge of something you do have to project a certain level of authority and control. It's the same reason I can't tell my audience how I don't know where my snake is.&sp[John Oliver leans under his desk and pulls up a decorated snake container, where the camera then zooms in on how it's empty]&spJohn Oliver: It would cause a panic, even though there's no need for that because he's not venomous, I- I assume. Th- the website I bought him from wasn't in English but it's a moot point anyway because relax, I- I- I definitely know where my snake is, and...&sp[John Oliver places the snake container back below his desk]&spJohn Oliver: I- I know where my snake is.
The second occurrence happens over two minutes later after discussing a clip from 1997 of the former govener of Arizona Fife Symington downplaying the Phoenix Lights. The Phoenix Lights were multiple UFOs seen over Arizona and Nevada on March 13, 1997. Thousands saw the UFOs, as Oliver shows a clip of a press conference held by Symington regarding the UFOs. Symington claims he knows the reasoning behind the Phoenix Lights, following up with a person in an alien costume walking out. After a bit with a person in a green bird costume coming out in response, Oliver continues:&pJohn Oliver: And the thing is that Govener later admitted that he "saw the lights, too" and didn't know what they were. He just didn't feel like he could say that publicly. I guess he was much like me with my missing snake.&sp[The image of the clip is replaced with a drawing of the snake with a question mark over it]&spJohn Oliver: He'd much rather people stop asking questions about it so he just made a joke out of something that deep down he worried might actually be a serious problem. But again, again, I know where my snake is.
The last occurrence of John Oliver's snake is at the end of the episode after his call to action:&pJohn Oliver: But there needs to be room for honest inquiry because science is all about collecting small answers that eventually help us address big questions, like: "Are we alone in the universe?", "What is that that I just saw in the sky?", and for the final time, where actually is my snake? I'm serious. Can everyone please look under their chairs 'cuz I genuinely do not know where it is. That is our show. Thank you so much for watching. This has been Last Week Tonight. I'm John Oliver and the vape is dragonfruit banana.&sp[John Oliver takes a puff from a vape before blowing it towards the camera]&spJohn Oliver: Good night!&sp[John Oliver looks down over his desk before standing up and pointing at the snake on the ground]&spJohn Oliver: Oh shit! There it is! There it is! There's my snake! I found it!&sp[The camera focuses and zooms in on the snake]&spJohn Oliver: That's- hold on a second. Yeah, that's... that's not actually my snake. That's a- that's a different snake.&sp[The snake is shown climbing up a glowing panel with the logo for {{aiLast Week Tonight}}]&spJohn Oliver: My snake looks like that but that's a different snake. This is- this is someone else's snake. Someone please come get your snake.</div>
