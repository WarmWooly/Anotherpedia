  <h1>John Oliver's snake</h1>
  <div><<shortReoccuring bit in {{iLast Week Tonight with John Oliver}}short>>{{bJohn Oliver's snake}} was a reoccurring [[bit|bit (comedy)]] in [[season 11|Season 11 (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver)]] episode 9 of {{i[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]}} titled "[[UFOs|UFOs (Last Week Tonight with John Oliver)]]" where [[John Oliver]] lost his [[snake]]. It starts with a [[clip|video clip]] of [[Mark O'Connell]] on [[WTTV]] in 2017 stating that the [[Air Force|United States Air Force]] doesn't want to seem [[incompetent]] by not being able to explain a [[UFO]], with Oliver trying not to look incompetent to the [[audience]] discussing the pet snake that he lost while bringing out an empty [[snake container]]. He then brings up his snake for another [[joke]] later in the segment, until culminating in the [[finale]] where a snake is found in front of Oliver's desk, but it isn't Oliver's snake. The snake's [[species]] hasn't been confirmed, but it has been guessed to most likely be the [[California kingsnake]] by fans.<<hrBreakdownhr>><<hr2First Occurencehr2>><<img(src=git/john oliver snakeless.png(cap=John Oliver holding up an empty snake container.img>>The first occurrence starts roughly around halfway through the episode:&p[{{iFrom a clip from WTTV in 2017}}]&sp{{bMark O'Connell}}: You can cover up knowing something, or you can cover up not knowing something, and I think it's- it's just as likely that the Air Force is covering up not knowing anything.&sp{{bUnidentified Host}}: Why would they do that?&sp{{bMark O'Connell}}: Because they can't- they can't afford to look incompetent. They can't admit to the public that they don't know what these things are in our sky.&sp[{{iThe clip ends, showing John Oliver off to the right as he begins speaking}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: That [[John C. Reilly]] character makes a good point there. When you're in charge of something you do have to project a certain level of authority and control. It's the same reason I can't tell my audience how I don't know where my snake is.&sp[{{iJohn Oliver leans under his desk and pulls up a decorated snake container, where the camera then zooms in on how it's empty}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: It would cause a panic, even though there's no need for that because he's not [[venomous]], I- I assume. Th- the website I bought him from wasn't in English but it's a [[moot]] point anyway because relax, I- I- I definitely know where my snake is, and...&sp[{{iJohn Oliver places the snake container back below his desk}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: I- I know where my snake is.<<hr2Second Occurencehr2>><<img(src=git/john oliver snake image.png(cap=John Oliver and the [[drawing]] representing his missing snake.img>>The second occurrence happens over two minutes later after discussing a clip from 1997 of the former [[govener of Arizona]] [[Fife Symington]] downplaying the [[Phoenix Lights]]. The Phoenix Lights were multiple UFOs seen over [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]] on March 13, 1997. Thousands saw the UFOs, as Oliver shows a clip of a [[press conference]] held by Symington regarding the UFOs. Symington claims he knows the reasoning behind the Phoenix Lights, following up with a person in an [[alien costume]] walking out. After a bit with a person in a green bird costume coming out in response, Oliver continues:&p{{bJohn Oliver}}: And the thing is that Govener later admitted that he "saw the lights, too" and didn't know what they were. He just didn't feel like he could say that publicly. I guess he was much like me with my missing snake.&sp[{{iThe image of the clip is replaced with a drawing of the snake with a question mark over it}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: He'd much rather people stop asking questions about it so he just made a joke out of something that deep down he worried might actually be a serious problem. But again, again, I know where my snake is.<<hr2Third Occurencehr2>><<img(src=git/john olivers snake.png(cap=Someone's snake on the ground.img>>The last occurrence of John Oliver's snake is at the end of the episode after his [[call to action]]:&p{{bJohn Oliver}}: But there needs to be room for honest inquiry because science is all about collecting small answers that eventually help us address big questions, like: "Are we alone in the universe?", "What is that that I just saw in the sky?", and for the final time, where actually is my snake? I'm serious. Can everyone please look under their chairs 'cuz I genuinely do not know where it is. That is our show. Thank you so much for watching. This has been {{iLast Week Tonight}}. I'm John Oliver and the [[vape]] is dragonfruit banana.&sp[{{iJohn Oliver takes a puff from a vape before blowing it towards the camera}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: Good night!&sp[{{iJohn Oliver looks down over his desk before standing up and pointing at the snake on the ground}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: Oh shit! There it is! There it is! There's my snake! I found it!&sp[{{iThe camera focuses and zooms in on the snake}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: That's- hold on a second. Yeah, that's... that's not actually my snake. That's a- that's a different snake.&sp[{{iThe snake is shown climbing up a glowing panel with the [[logo]] for {{aiLast Week Tonight}}}}]&sp{{bJohn Oliver}}: My snake looks like that but that's a different snake. This is- this is someone else's snake. Someone please come get your snake.</div>
