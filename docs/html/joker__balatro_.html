      <h1>Joker (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>For the general type of card, see Jokers ({{aiBalatro).}}<br>Joker is a Jokers (Balatro) in Balatro that is considered to be the most simple of the Jokers, giving a +4 Multiplier (Balatro) when activated. Joker is the first Joker introduced in the game, serving as a simple tutorial to how buying and using Jokers from The Shop (Balatro) works. Joker doesn't serve much purpose besides giving a boost for the early game. Jimbo (Balatro) takes the form of Joker, appearing during the tutorial and during a Game Over (Balatro). If all Jokers of a rarity are held while generating a random Joker, it will create a Joker (ex. using The Soul (Balatro) 6 times, getting the 5 Legendaries and a Joker).
