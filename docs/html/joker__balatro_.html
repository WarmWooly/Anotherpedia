  <h1>Joker (Balatro)</h1>
  <div><<short+4 Mult Joker in {{iBalatro}}short>>{{tFor the general type of card, see [[Jokers ({{aiBalatro}})]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/joker balatro.png(cap=Joker.img>>{{bJoker}} is a [[Joker|Jokers (Balatro)]] in {{i[[Balatro]]}} that is considered to be the most simple of the Jokers, giving a +4 [[Mult|Multiplier (Balatro)]] when activated. Joker is the first Joker introduced in the game, serving as a simple tutorial to how buying and using Jokers from [[The Shop|The Shop (Balatro)]] works. Joker doesn't serve much purpose besides giving a boost for the early game. [[Jimbo|Jimbo (Balatro)]] takes the form of Joker, appearing during the tutorial and during a [[Game Over|Game Over (Balatro)]]. If all Jokers of a rarity are held while generating a random Joker, it will create a Joker (ex. using [[The Soul|The Soul (Balatro)]] 6 times, getting the 5 Legendaries and a Joker).<<hrCard statshr>>{{bEffect:}} +4 Mult&sp{{b[[Rarity|Rarity (Balatro)]]:}} Common&sp{{bUnlock:}} Available from start.&sp{{b[[Buy|Buying (Balatro)]]/[[Sell|Selling (Balatro)]] Cost:}} [[$|Money (Balatro)]]2/$1&sp{{b[[Activation|Activation Type (Balatro)]]:}} Independent&sp{{b[[Copyable|Copying (Balatro)]]:}} Yes&sp{{b[[Perishable|Perishable Sticker (Balatro)]]:}} Yes&sp{{b[[Eternalable|Eternal Sticker (Balatro)]]:}} Yes</div>
