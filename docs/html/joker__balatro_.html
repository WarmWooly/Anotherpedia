      <h1>Joker (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>For the general type of card, see Jokers ({{aiBalatro).}}&spJoker is a Joker in Balatro that is considered to be the most simple of the Jokers, giving a +4 Mult when activated. Joker is the first Joker introduced in the game, serving as a simple tutorial to how buying and using Jokers from The Shop works. Joker doesn't serve much purpose besides giving a boost for the early game. Jimbo takes the form of Joker, appearing during the tutorial and during a Game Over. If all Jokers of a rarity are held while generating a random Joker, it will create a Joker (ex. using The Soul 6 times, getting the 5 Legendaries and a Joker).
Effect: +4 Mult&spRarity: Common&spUnlock: Available from start.&spBuy/Sell Cost: $2/$1&spActivation: Independent&spCopyable: Yes&spPerishable: Yes&spEternalable: Yes</div>
