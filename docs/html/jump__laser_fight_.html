      <h1>Jump (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A jump is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by pressing codeSpace while grounded. Jumping is used to gain height and cross between gaps. Jumping requires 5 stamina to perform, with only a tiny hop being done instead if the player has insufficient stamina. Jumping can be used for a wide variety of moves, such as exiting a slide, vaulting over an obstacle, performing a wall climb/launch from a wall hang, performing a fall break to prevent fall damage, or to scale a wall while wallrunning.
Main page: Bunnyhopping ({{aiLaser Fight)}}&spIf a player jumps multiple times in succession without stopping, they will build up speed through bunnyhopping. Every jump after the third in a bunnyhop will increase the normal movement speed by 10% and will only cost 3 stamina to perform.</div>
