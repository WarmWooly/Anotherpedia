      <h1>Jump (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A jump is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by pressing codeSpace while grounded. Jumping is used to gain height and cross between gaps. Jumping requires 5 stamina (Laser Fight) to perform, with only a tiny hop being done instead if the player has insufficient stamina. Jumping can be used for a wide variety of moves, such as exiting a slide (Laser Fight), vault (Laser Fight) over an obstacle, performing a wall climb (Laser Fight)/wall launch (Laser Fight) from a wall hang (Laser Fight), performing a fall break (Laser Fight) to prevent fall damage (Laser Fight), or to scale a wall while wallrun (Laser Fight).
Main page: Bunnyhopping ({{aiLaser Fight)}}&spIf a player jumps multiple times in succession without stopping, they will build up speed through bunnyhopping (Laser Fight). Every jump after the third in a bunnyhop will increase the normal movement speed by 10% and will only cost 3 stamina to perform.</div>
