      <h1>Jurassic Rook</h1>
      <div>A Jurassic Rook is a move in 5D Chess with Multiverse Time-Travel where a rook is sent back through time, often reverting the game into such a state that nullifies all the progress for both players. It is best used to give the rooker a "second chance", greatly extending the game's length.&pThe most infamous game to use the Jurassic Rook was Aliensrock vs. Samet The Turk, where Aliensrock forfeits to Samet The Turk after being Jurassic Rooked to the start of the game.</div>
