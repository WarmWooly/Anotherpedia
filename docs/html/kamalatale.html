      <h1>KAMALATALE</h1>
      <div>{{iKAMALATALE}} (also written as {{iKamala-Tale}}) is a parody 2024 video game of Undertale by, published by Gamers for Harris on itch.io on November 2, 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://kamalatale.itch.io/kamala-tale(text=refCountref>> The game features many mechanics from Undertale, including a top-down perspective open world, a bullet hell system, multiple routes, and the combat options "Prosecute", "Debate", "Stuff", and "Pardon" (in place of "Fight", "Act", "Item", and "Mercy"). The protagonist of KAMALATALE is a depiction of the 2020--2024 Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris. The game is set during the 2024 United States presidential election after Joe Biden left the presidential race, leading Kamala Harris to perform her own campaign.
Due to how similar KAMALATALE and Undertale are, in addition to the political messaging brought up by the idea of a Undertale-esque game and the additional monetary cost, has caused speculation that KAMALATALE could be infringing on Undertale's copyright. This is in addition to KAMALATALE's Steam page getting taken down.<<ref(content=link|https://store.steampowered.com/app/3263390/KamalaTale/(text=refCountref>> In the V1.0.3 devlog, KAMALATALE made a message about the legal concerns a day after its release.<<ref(content=link|https://kamalatale.itch.io/kamala-tale/devlog/827350/v103-a-message-about-legal-concerns(text=refCountref>> They state that "the game does not contain assets that infringe on the copyrights of other games, nor is its programming derived from any other titles" and that "[KAMALATALE is] a piece of satire, protected under fair use and parody laws, and it is not intended to be a fangame", using fair use as a protection for their title. Even with this message, some fans have shown concern that it may still be illegal to sell KAMALATALE due to "ripped" content from Undertale.<<ref(content=link|https://itch.io/post/11298131(text=refCountref>></div>
