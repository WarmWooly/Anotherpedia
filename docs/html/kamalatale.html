The [[protagonist]] of {{iKAMALATALE}} is a depiction of the 2020--2024 [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Kamala Harris]]. The game is set during the [[2024 United States presidential election]] after [[Joe Biden]] [[left the presidential race|Withdrawal of Joe Biden from the 2024 United States presidential election]], leading Kamala Harris to perform [[her own campaign|Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign]].<<hrLegal concernshr>>Due to how similar {{iKAMALATALE}} and {{iUndertale}} are, in addition to the [[political messaging]] brought up by the idea of a {{iUndertale}}-esque game and the additional monetary cost, has caused speculation that {{iKAMALATALE}} could be [[infringing|copyright infringement]] on {{iUndertale}}'s [[copyright]]. This is in addition to {{iKAMALATALE}}'s [[Steam|Steam (service)]] page getting taken down.<<ref(content=link|https://store.steampowered.com/app/3263390/KamalaTale/(text=refCountref>> In the V1.0.3 [[devlog]], {{iKAMALATALE}} made a message about the legal concerns a day after its release.<<ref(content=link|https://kamalatale.itch.io/kamala-tale/devlog/827350/v103-a-message-about-legal-concerns(text=refCountref>> They state that "the game does not contain assets that infringe on the copyrights of other games, nor is its programming derived from any other titles" and that "[KAMALATALE is] a piece of satire, protected under fair use and parody laws, and it is not intended to be a fangame", using [[fair use]] as a protection for their title. Even with this message, some fans have shown concern that it may still be illegal to sell {{iKAMALATALE}} due to "ripped" content from {{iUndertale}}.<<ref(content=link|https://itch.io/post/11298131(text=refCountref>></div>
