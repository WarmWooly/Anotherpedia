Due to how similar {{iKAMALATALE}} and {{iUndertale}} are, in addition to the political messaging brought up by the idea of a {{iUndertale}}-esque game and the additional monetary cost, has caused speculation that {{iKAMALATALE}} could be copyright infringement on {{iUndertale}}'s copyright. This is in addition to {{iKAMALATALE}}'s Steam (service) page getting taken down.<<ref(content=link|https://store.steampowered.com/app/3263390/KamalaTale/(text=refCountref>> In the V1.0.3 devlog, {{iKAMALATALE}} made a message about the legal concerns a day after its release.<<ref(content=link|https://kamalatale.itch.io/kamala-tale/devlog/827350/v103-a-message-about-legal-concerns(text=refCountref>> They state that "the game does not contain assets that infringe on the copyrights of other games, nor is its programming derived from any other titles" and that "[KAMALATALE is] a piece of satire, protected under fair use and parody laws, and it is not intended to be a fangame", using fair use as a protection for their title. Even with this message, some fans have shown concern that it may still be illegal to sell {{iKAMALATALE}} due to "ripped" content from {{iUndertale}}.<<ref(content=link|https://itch.io/post/11298131(text=refCountref>></div>
