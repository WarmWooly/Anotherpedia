      <h1>Keyboard warrior</h1>
      <div>A keyboard warrior is a person on the internet, often anonymous, who makes heated discussions about topics, usually believing that they are in the right. Their viewpoints are often strong opinions with little basis or facts. Most keyboard warriors go alone, but rarely, mobs form to flood a chatroom or discussion, drowning out the voices of others with differing opinions. Keyboard warriors do not act the same in person as they do online, using the screen to be free to say what they are really thinking.</div>
