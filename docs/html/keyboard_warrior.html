  <h1>Keyboard warrior</h1>
  <div>A keyboard warrior is a person on the internet, often anonymous, who makes anger discussions about topics, usually believing that they are in the correct. Their viewpoints are often strong opinion with little basis or fact. Most keyboard warriors go alone, but rarely, mob form to spam a chatroom or internet discussion, drowning out the voices of others with differing opinions. Keyboard warriors do not act the same in person as they do online, using the screen to be free to say what they are really thinking.</div>
