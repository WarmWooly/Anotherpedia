      <h1>Kia Challenge</h1>
      <div>The Kia Challenge was a challenge where the participants would break into and steal a car on social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube.<br><br>The main cause was a lack of an immobilizer, which prevented theft via bypassing the ignition. Between 2011 and 2021, some cars manufactured by Hyundai and Kia lacked immobilizers, which made them much easier to steal. The Kia Boys, also known as the Kia Boyz, are a collective group of teenagers who would hack into the car, before joyriding until they crashed or dumped the car. A notable location for the activity was Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the trend started in October 2022.<br><br>In the end, there were thousands of cars stolen, with multiple car accidents and several fatalities caused by this challenge. Kia and Hyundai provided anti theft devices, alongside free software patches. TikTok has stated that they would remove tutorials related to stealing Kias and Hyundais.</div>
