  <h1>Kill streak ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortTriggerable effect in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/kill streak laser fight.png(cap=The level menu, showing various kill streaks.img>>A {{bkill streak}} is a triggerable effect mid-[[round|round (Laser Fight)]] to buff the player or harm opponents in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}}. While all kill streaks are immediately unlocked for new players, upgrading them requires the player to earn [[levels|level (Laser Fight)]] to gain skill points (SP). Players also only start with one kill streak slot, but this can also be increased to up to 5 slots using skill points. Every streak requires kill points (KP) to use, which are earned by killing opponents. Every kill will give KP equal to the player's current kill streak, incentivizing the player to stay alive for longer to get more KP per kill. Kill streaks can be used with {{codeZ}}, {{codeX}}, {{codeC}}, {{codeV}}, and {{codeB}}, depending on the number of kill streak slots that are unlocked. There are a total of 14 kill streaks and 1 upgrade, with the SP needed to level them up:<<table{{bKill streak}}|{{bLvl. 2}}|{{bLvl. 3}}|{{bLvl. 4}}|{{bLvl. 5}}||Streak Slots|{{r2}}|{{r5}}|{{r25}}|{{r50}}||[[Stamina Refill Speed|Stamina Refill Speed (Laser Fight)]]|{{r1}}|{{r2}}|{{r2}}|{{r3}}||[[Stamina Increase|Stamina Increase (Laser Fight)]]|{{r2}}|{{r3}}|{{r3}}|{{r4}}||[[Jump Boost|Jump Boost (Laser Fight)]]|{{r1}}|{{r2}}|{{r2}}|{{r3}}||[[Speed Boost|Speed Boost (Laser Fight)]]|{{r2}}|{{r3}}|{{r3}}|{{r4}}||[[Launch|Launch (Laser Fight)]]|{{r-}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}||[[Sticky Fingers|Sticky Fingers (Laser Fight)]]|{{r-}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}||[[Firerate Increase|Firerate Increase (Laser Fight)]]|{{r4}}|{{r5}}|{{r5}}|{{r6}}||[[Kill Conversion|Kill Conversion (Laser Fight)]]|{{r3}}|{{r6}}|{{r12}}|{{r18}}||[[Black Market|Black Market (Laser Fight)]]|{{r5}}|{{r10}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}||[[Exp Boost|Exp Boost (Laser Fight)]]|{{r5}}|{{r6}}|{{r6}}|{{r8}}||[[Invincibility|Invincibility (Laser Fight kill streak)]]|{{r3}}|{{r4}}|{{r4}}|{{r5}}||[[Turret|Turret (Laser Fight)]]|{{r4}}|{{r5}}|{{r5}}|{{r6}}||[[Nextbot|Nextbot (Laser Fight)]]|{{r4}}|{{r5}}|{{r5}}|{{r6}}||[[Nuke|Nuke (Laser Fight)]]|{{r-}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}|{{r-}}table>></div>
