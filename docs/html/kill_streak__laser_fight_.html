      <h1>Kill streak (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A kill streak is a triggerable effect mid-round (Laser Fight) to buff the player or harm opponents in Laser Fight (Roblox game). While all kill streaks are immediately unlocked for new players, upgrading them requires the player to earn level (Laser Fight) to gain skill points (SP). Players also only start with one kill streak slot, but this can also be increased to up to 5 slots using skill points. Every streak requires kill points (KP) to use, which are earned by killing opponents. Every kill will give KP equal to the player's current kill streak, incentivizing the player to stay alive for longer to get more KP per kill. Kill streaks can be used with codeZ, codeX, codeC, codeV, and codeB, depending on the number of kill streak slots that are unlocked. There are a total of 14 kill streaks and 1 upgrade, with the SP needed to level them up:<<tableKill streak|Lvl. 2|Lvl. 3|Lvl. 4|Lvl. 5||Streak Slots|r2|r5|r25|r50||Stamina Refill Speed (Laser Fight)|r1|r2|r2|r3||Stamina Increase (Laser Fight)|r2|r3|r3|r4||Jump Boost (Laser Fight)|r1|r2|r2|r3||Speed Boost (Laser Fight)|r2|r3|r3|r4||Launch (Laser Fight)|r-|r-|r-|r-||Sticky Fingers (Laser Fight)|r-|r-|r-|r-||Firerate Increase (Laser Fight)|r4|r5|r5|r6||Kill Conversion (Laser Fight)|r3|r6|r12|r18||Black Market (Laser Fight)|r5|r10|r-|r-||Exp Boost (Laser Fight)|r5|r6|r6|r8||Invincibility (Laser Fight kill streak)|r3|r4|r4|r5||Turret (Laser Fight)|r4|r5|r5|r6||Nextbot (Laser Fight)|r4|r5|r5|r6||Nuke (Laser Fight)|r-|r-|r-|r-table>></div>
