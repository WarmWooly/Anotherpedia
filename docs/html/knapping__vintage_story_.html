      <div><<shortStone crafting process in {{iVintage Story}}short>><<img(src=git/knapping vintage story.png(cap=Obsidian being knapped into an axe head.img>>{{bKnapping}} is a [[crafting process|crafting process (Vintage Story)]] within {{i[[Vintage Story]]}} to create various early-game tool heads using [[stones|stone (Vintage Story)]], [[flint|flint (Vintage Story)]], or [[obsidian|obsidian stone (Vintage Story)]]. After selecting a recipe, [[voxels|voxel]] can be removed from the craft until it has been shaped to match the guidelines given. Knapping requires one stone to be placed on the ground, with a second one held to remove material.&pWhile all stones can be used to remove material off a knapped item, only [[andesite|andesite (Vintage Story)]], [[basalt|basalt (Vintage Story)]], [[chert|chert (Vintage Story)]], [[granite|granite (Vintage Story)]], and [[peridotite|peridotite (Vintage Story)]] are hard enough to be knapped into shape. Obsidian results in the strongest tools, followed by flint, then all other stones.<<hrKnappable itemshr>>The following items can be knapped:&sp[[Arrowhead|Knapped Arrowhead (Vintage Story)]] x6<<note(content=Only flint and obsidian can be used to make arrowheads.(text=noteCountnote>>&sp[[Axe Head|Knapped Axe Head (Vintage Story)]]&sp[[Hoe Head|Knapped Hoe Head (Vintage Story)]]&sp[[Knife Blade|Knapped Knife Blade (Vintage Story)]]&sp[[Shovel Head|Shovel Head (Vintage Story)]]&sp[[Spear Head|Knapped Spear Head (Vintage Story)]]</div>
