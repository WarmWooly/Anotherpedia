      <h1>Knapping (Vintage Story)</h1>
      <div>Knapping is a crafting process (Vintage Story) within Vintage Story to create various early-game tool heads using stone (Vintage Story), flint (Vintage Story), or obsidian stone (Vintage Story). After selecting a recipe, voxel can be removed from the craft until it has been shaped to match the guidelines given. Knapping requires one stone to be placed on the ground, with a second one held to remove material.<br><br>While all stones can be used to remove material off a knapped item, only andesite (Vintage Story), basalt (Vintage Story), chert (Vintage Story), granite (Vintage Story), and peridotite (Vintage Story) are hard enough to be knapped into shape. Obsidian results in the strongest tools, followed by flint, then all other stones.

The following items can be knapped:<br>Knapped Arrowhead (Vintage Story) x6<br>Knapped Axe Head (Vintage Story)<br>Knapped Hoe Head (Vintage Story)<br>Knapped Knife Blade (Vintage Story)<br>Shovel Head (Vintage Story)<br>Knapped Spear Head (Vintage Story)</div>
