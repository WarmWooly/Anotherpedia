      <h1>Knapping (Vintage Story)</h1>
      <div>Knapping is a crafting process within Vintage Story to create various early-game tool heads using stones, flint, or obsidian. After selecting a recipe, voxels can be removed from the craft until it has been shaped to match the guidelines given. Knapping requires one stone to be placed on the ground, with a second one held to remove material.&pWhile all stones can be used to remove material off a knapped item, only andesite, basalt, chert, granite, and peridotite are hard enough to be knapped into shape. Obsidian results in the strongest tools, followed by flint, then all other stones.
The following items can be knapped:&spArrowhead x6<<note(content=Only flint and obsidian can be used to make arrowheads.(text=noteCountnote>>&spAxe Head&spHoe Head&spKnife Blade&spShovel Head&spSpear Head</div>
