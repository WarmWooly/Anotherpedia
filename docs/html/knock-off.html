      <div>For the 1998 action/triller, see {{aiKnock Off (film).}}&spA knock-off is a copy of a work or object, such as art or a video, which is used as a substitute for the thing being knocked off. Knock-offs are made to be cheaper than the original that is being copied. When the likeness of a brand is being knocked off, it's known as an off-brand.</div>
