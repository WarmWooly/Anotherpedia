  <h1>Knot jamming</h1>
  <div>Not to be confused with the jamming knot.&spKnot jamming refers to getting a knot into a state where it is difficult to untying. Knot jams are more common with some knots than others, often called jamming knots. Knot jamming is often unwanted, so some knots (such as the bowline) are unable to jam and are called non-jamming knots.</div>
