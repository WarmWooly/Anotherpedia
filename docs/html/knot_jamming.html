  <h1>Knot jamming</h1>
  <div>{{tNot to be confused with the jamming knot.}}&sp{{bKnot jamming}} refers to getting a knot into a state where it is difficult to untying. Knot jams are more common with some knots than others, often called {{bjamming knots}}. Knot jamming is often unwanted, so some knots (such as the bowline) are unable to jam and are called {{bnon-jamming knots}}.</div>
