      <h1>Knot jamming</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with the jamming knot.<br>Knot jamming refers to getting a knot into a state where it is difficult to untie. Knot jams are more common with some knots than others, often called jamming knots. Knot jamming is often unwanted, so some knots (such as the bowline) are unable to jam and are called non-jamming knots.</div>
