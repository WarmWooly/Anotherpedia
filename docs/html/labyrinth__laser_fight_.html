      <h1>Labyrinth (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Labyrinth is a large outdoor map (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox Game) with a large maze in the middle. Players spawn in one of the four colored bases on the sides of the map. The corners have towers that can be scaled. The center has a large maze with two levels and several ladders to go between levels. Players can also fall break (Laser Fight) to get to the floor faster. The main challenge of the map is navigating the tight spaces to grab valuable gun (Laser Fight), waiting for the right time to exit the maze, or climbing on the walls to fight in the open.</div>
