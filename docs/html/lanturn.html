The tail fin's lower half has a yellow coloration and two more jagged edges than the top. Lanturn's face has a yellow mask above its mouth covering its reddish-orange eyes. It has a blue illicium (anglerfish) (antenna) with a large yellow esca (anglerfish) (orb) leaning forward atop its back, along with a smaller offshoot and esca leaning backward.&pLanturn's official size is 3 foot (unit) and 11 inch, while weighing 49.6 pound. shiny (pokémon) Lanturns are a light purple instead of blue and have a brighter yellow color.&pLanturn's name is a play on {{ilantern}}, both emitting light.
The light produced in Lanturn's escas are caused by bacteria reacting to bodily fluids within the illicium. It lives in the deep ocean, but its light is visible on the surface up to a depth of 3 miles. Like anglerfish, Lanturn uses its glow to attract prey before swallowing them whole.
A Lanturn has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Lanturn is the 171st Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color blue.&pLanturn evolution (Pokémon) from Chinchou at leveling (Pokémon) 27.</div>
