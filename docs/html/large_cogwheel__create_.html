      <h1>Large Cogwheel (Create)</h1>
      <div>For the smaller cog, see cogwheel ({{aiCreate).}}<br><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden axe (Minecraft)<br>/Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|6||hardness (Minecraft)|1.5||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|Yes||Waterlogging (Minecraft)|Yes||{{bFlammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The large cogwheel is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Create (Minecraft mod) used in carrying rotational power (Create). It can both carry rotation along its shaft to the front and back of it and to its sides to any connected cogwheel (Create), large cogwheels, and other blocks requiring rotational power.



There are multiple recipes to obtain large cogwheels:<br>1 shaft (Create) and 2 planks (Minecraft) (shapeless) --> 1 large cogwheel<br>1 cogwheel (Create) and 1 planks (Minecraft) (shapeless) --> 1 large cogwheel

A large cogwheel can be crafted with a mechanical mixer (Create) mixing 1 shaft (Create) and 2 planks (Minecraft) or 1 cogwheel (Create) and 1 plank in a basin (Create).

A large cogwheel can be created when a deployer (Create) places a planks (Minecraft) onto a cogwheel (Create) on a depot (Create) or mechanical belt (Create).



A large cogwheel can transfer rotational power (Create) to interlocking large cogwheels. Unlike cogwheel (Create), large cogwheels can't be placed flat next to each other, but are rather rotated 90&deg. Large cogwheels can also connect to shaft (Create), blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. water wheel (Create)), and blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. millstone (Create)). When a large cogwheel transfers rotational power to another large cogwheel, the rotation direction (Create) of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an encased fan (Create) suck instead of blow) or change the direction of mechanical belt (Create).<br><br>When placing large cogwheels, they can be quickly placed against each other, with a ghost image showing where the large cogwheel will be placed. If the player is wearing engineer's goggles (Create), a particle effect will show the direction of the placed large cogwheel. If a large cogwheel is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.

When a large cogwheel is diagonal to a cogwheel (Create), the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a cogwheel, the RPM will double, and if the cogwheel is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the stress (Create) used. When a cogwheel and a large cogwheel are connected, the advancement (Minecraft) Shifting Gears (Create) will be awarded.

Large cogwheels can be encased using andesite casing (Create) and brass casing (Create). This serves both as a decorative covering to integrate large cogwheels into builds and to prevent shafts/cogwheels from connecting to the large cogwheel. A wrench (Create) can be used to create openings for shafts to connect to the encased large cogwheel.

Large cogwheels are used in the following crafting (Minecraft) recipes:<br>Chain Conveyor (Create) x2 - 1 large cogwheel and 4 andesite casing (Create) (place the cogwheel in the center and surround with casings).

The following items can be made with mechanical crafter (Create) with large cogwheels: Chain Conveyor (Create) (5 crafters; makes 2).

Large cogwheels are used in the following sequenced assembly (Create):<br>Precision Mechanism (Create) - On a golden sheet (Create), deploy a cogwheel (Create), then a large cogwheel, and lastly an iron nugget (Minecraft), repeating the sequence 5 times (costs 5 cogwheels, 5 large cogwheels, 5 iron nuggets, and 1 golden sheet).</div>
