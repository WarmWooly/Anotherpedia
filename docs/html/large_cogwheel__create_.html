It can both carry rotation along its shaft to the front and back of it and to its sides to any connected [[cogwheels|cogwheel (Create)]], large cogwheels, and other blocks requiring rotational power.<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>There are multiple recipes to obtain large cogwheels:&sp1 [[shaft|shaft (Create)]] and 2 [[planks|planks (Minecraft)]] (shapeless) --> 1 large cogwheel&sp1 [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]] and 1 [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] (shapeless) --> 1 large cogwheel<<hr3Automated shapeless craftinghr3>>A large cogwheel can be crafted with a [[mechanical mixer|mechanical mixer (Create)]] mixing 1 [[shaft|shaft (Create)]] and 2 [[planks|planks (Minecraft)]] or 1 [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]] and 1 plank in a [[basin|basin (Create)]].<<hr2Deployinghr2>>A large cogwheel can be created when a [[deployer|deployer (Create)]] places a [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]] onto a [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]] on a [[depot|depot (Create)]] or [[mechanical belt|mechanical belt (Create)]].<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Transfering rotational powerhr2>><<img(src=git/large cogwheel transfer create.gif(cap=Large cogwheels transferring rotational power.(leftImgimg>>A large cogwheel can transfer [[rotational power|rotational power (Create)]] to interlocking large cogwheels. Unlike [[cogwheels|cogwheel (Create)]], large cogwheels can't be placed flat next to each other, but are rather rotated 90&deg. Large cogwheels can also connect to [[shafts|shaft (Create)]], blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. [[water wheels|water wheel (Create)]]), and blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. [[millstones|millstone (Create)]]). When a large cogwheel transfers rotational power to another large cogwheel, the [[direction|rotation direction (Create)]] of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an [[encased fan|encased fan (Create)]] suck instead of blow) or change the direction of [[mechanical belts|mechanical belt (Create)]].&pWhen placing large cogwheels, they can be quickly placed against each other, with a ghost image showing where the large cogwheel will be placed. If the player is wearing [[engineer's goggles|engineer's goggles (Create)]], a particle effect will show the direction of the placed large cogwheel. If a large cogwheel is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.<<hr3Gearshiftinghr3>><<img(src=git/cogwheel gearshift create.gif(cap=A large cogwheel gearshifting into cogwheels.img>>When a large cogwheel is diagonal to a [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]], the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a cogwheel, the RPM will double, and if the cogwheel is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the [[stress|stress (Create)]] used. When a cogwheel and a large cogwheel are connected, the [[advancement|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Shifting Gears|Shifting Gears (Create)]] will be awarded.<<hr3Casinghr3>><<img(src=git/encased large cogwheel create.png(cap=Encased large cogwheels.img>>Large cogwheels can be encased using [[andesite|andesite casing (Create)]] and [[brass casing|brass casing (Create)]]. This serves both as a decorative covering to integrate large cogwheels into builds and to prevent shafts/cogwheels from connecting to the large cogwheel. A [[wrench|wrench (Create)]] can be used to create openings for shafts to connect to the encased large cogwheel.<<hr2Craftinghr2>>Large cogwheels are used in the following [[crafting|crafting (Minecraft)]] recipes:&sp[[Chain Conveyor|Chain Conveyor (Create)]] x2 - 1 large cogwheel and 4 [[andesite casings|andesite casing (Create)]] (place the cogwheel in the center and surround with casings).<<hr3Automated shaped craftinghr3>>The following items can be made with [[mechanical crafters|mechanical crafter (Create)]] with large cogwheels: [[Chain Conveyor|Chain Conveyor (Create)]] (5 crafters; makes 2).<<hr2Sequenced assemblyhr2>>Large cogwheels are used in the following [[sequenced assemblies|sequenced assembly (Create)]]:&sp[[Precision Mechanism|Precision Mechanism (Create)]]<<note(content=There is only an 80% chance of getting a precision mechanism, with a 20% chance to get salvage: 5.4% for [[andesite alloy|andesite alloy (Create)]], 5.4% for a [[golden sheet|golden sheet (Create)]], 3.4% for a [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]], 1.4% for [[crushed gold ore|crushed gold ore (Create)]], 1.4% for a [[gold nugget|gold nugget (Minecraft)]], 1.4% for a [[shaft|shaft (Create)]], 0.7% for a [[clock|clock (Minecraft), and 0.7% for an [[iron ingot|iron ingot (Minecraft)]].(text=noteCountnote>> - On a [[golden sheet|golden sheet (Create)]], deploy a [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]], then a large cogwheel, and lastly an [[iron nugget|iron nugget (Minecraft)]], repeating the sequence 5 times (costs 5 cogwheels, 5 large cogwheels, 5 iron nuggets, and 1 golden sheet).</div>
