      <h1>Large Cogwheel (Create)</h1>

It can both carry rotation along its shaft to the front and back of it and to its sides to any connected cogwheels, large cogwheels, and other blocks requiring rotational power.
There are multiple recipes to obtain large cogwheels:&sp1 shaft and 2 planks (shapeless) --> 1 large cogwheel&sp1 cogwheel and 1 plank (shapeless) --> 1 large cogwheel
A large cogwheel can be crafted with a mechanical mixer mixing 1 shaft and 2 planks or 1 cogwheel and 1 plank in a basin.
A large cogwheel can be created when a deployer places a plank onto a cogwheel on a depot or mechanical belt.
A large cogwheel can transfer rotational power to interlocking large cogwheels. Unlike cogwheels, large cogwheels can't be placed flat next to each other, but are rather rotated 90&deg. Large cogwheels can also connect to shafts, blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. water wheels), and blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. millstones). When a large cogwheel transfers rotational power to another large cogwheel, the direction of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an encased fan suck instead of blow) or change the direction of mechanical belts.&pWhen placing large cogwheels, they can be quickly placed against each other, with a ghost image showing where the large cogwheel will be placed. If the player is wearing engineer's goggles, a particle effect will show the direction of the placed large cogwheel. If a large cogwheel is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.
When a large cogwheel is diagonal to a cogwheel, the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a cogwheel, the RPM will double, and if the cogwheel is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the stress used. When a cogwheel and a large cogwheel are connected, the advancement Shifting Gears will be awarded.
Large cogwheels can be encased using andesite and brass casing. This serves both as a decorative covering to integrate large cogwheels into builds and to prevent shafts/cogwheels from connecting to the large cogwheel. A wrench can be used to create openings for shafts to connect to the encased large cogwheel.
Large cogwheels are used in the following crafting recipes:&spChain Conveyor x2 - 1 large cogwheel and 4 andesite casings (place the cogwheel in the center and surround with casings).
The following items can be made with mechanical crafters with large cogwheels: Chain Conveyor (5 crafters; makes 2).
Large cogwheels are used in the following sequenced assemblies:&spPrecision Mechanism<<note(content=There is only an 80% chance of getting a precision mechanism, with a 20% chance to get salvage: 5.4% for andesite alloy, 5.4% for a golden sheet, 3.4% for a cogwheel, 1.4% for crushed gold ore, 1.4% for a gold nugget, 1.4% for a shaft, 0.7% for a clock.(text=noteCountnote>> - On a golden sheet, deploy a cogwheel, then a large cogwheel, and lastly an iron nugget, repeating the sequence 5 times (costs 5 cogwheels, 5 large cogwheels, 5 iron nuggets, and 1 golden sheet).</div>
