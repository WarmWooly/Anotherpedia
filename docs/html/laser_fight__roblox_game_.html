Each round, players try to get as many kills as possible within the time limit on a given map, mode, and coop. Based on the mode, players will collect or be given various guns with many effects, such as burst firing, having bullets last as physical objects in the world, or exploding. Laser Fight also has a dynamic movement system that can be used to climb, run, and slide around opponents.</div>
