      <h1>Last universal common ancestor</h1>
      <div>The last universal common ancestor, abbreviated as LUCA, is a hypothetical lifeform that came into existence roughly four billion years ago. It would be the first cell that would be able to reproduce, splitting over and over again into all life known on Earth. The origins of LUCA are unknown, but it would supposedly live by hydrothermic vents full of iron and sulfur. LUCA would have used hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen in the water to create organic compounds.</div>
