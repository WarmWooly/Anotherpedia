      <h1>Last universal common ancestor</h1>
      <div>The last universal common ancestor, abbreviation as LUCA, is a hypothetical lifeform that came into existence roughly four billion year ago. It would be the first cell that would be able to cellular reproduction, splitting over and over again into all life known on Earth. The origins of LUCA are unknown, but it would supposedly live by hydrothermic vent full of iron and sulfur. LUCA would have used hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen in the water to create organic compound.</div>
