The leathersmithing table can be crafted with 2 rose gold ingots, 2 leather, and 2 planks (place the planks on the bottom, then the rose gold above, then the leather on top).
The leathersmtihing table can be used to add various types of leather padding onto chainmail armor or shields to upgrade them. Items to be upgraded will go in the leftmost slot. The upgradable item can then be removed from the rightmost slot. The three slots in the middle are used to add/remove leather padding. There is no cost for adding or removing leather padding, and a maximum of three leather paddings can be added to an item.
