  <h1>Lenz's law</h1>
  <div><<shortElectromagnetic law by Emil Lenzshort>><<img(src=git/lenz law.png(cap=A [[diagram]] of Lenz's law.img>>{{bLenz's law}} is a [[scientific law]] under [[electromagnetism]] that was formulated in 1834 by the [[physicist]] [[Emil Lenz]]. Lenz's law goes:<<quoThe current induced in a circuit due to a change in a magnetic field is directed to oppose the change in flux and to exert a mechanical force which opposes the motion.quo>><<hrEquationhr>><<img(src=git/lenz law equation.svg(cap=The equation for Lenz's law.(brightImg(bigImgimg>>The [[equation]] for Lenz's law is comprised of the following [[terms|term (mathematics)]]:&sp&eps - The [[electromagnetic force]]&sp{{iN}} - The number of turns in the [[coil]]&sp&der - The [[partial derivative]]&sp&mphi{{s-b{{iB}}}} - The [[magnetic flux]]&sp{{it}} - [[Time]]&spThe equation reads:<<quo{{iThe electromagnetic force is [[equal]] to the [[negative]] of the [[product|product (mathematics)]] between the number of turns in the coil and the change of the magnetic flux divided by the change over time.}}quo>><<hrExplanationhr>>Lenz's law explains how when a [[magnetic field]] is changed near a [[conductor]], a [[current|current (electromagnetism)]] is induced in the conductor. This induced current generates a magnetic field that is opposite to the motion of the original magnetic field. The field produced is dependent on the turns in the coil and the rate at which the original field is produced. A stronger magnetic flux over a shorter period of time will induce a stronger opposing field.</div>
