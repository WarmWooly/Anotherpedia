      <h1>Lenz's law</h1>
      <div>Lenz's law is a scientific law under electromagnetism that was formulated in 1834 by the physicist Emil Lenz. Lenz's law goes:
The equation for Lenz's law is comprised of the following terms:&sp&eps - The electromagnetic force&spN - The number of turns in the coil&sp&der - The partial derivative&sp&mphis-b{{iB}} - The magnetic flux&spt - Time&spThe equation reads:
Lenz's law explains how when a magnetic field is changed near a conductor, a current is induced in the conductor. This induced current generates a magnetic field that is opposite to the motion of the original magnetic field. The field produced is dependent on the turns in the coil and the rate at which the original field is produced. A stronger magnetic flux over a shorter period of time will induce a stronger opposing field.</div>
