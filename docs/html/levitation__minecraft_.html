      <h1>Levitation (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>Levitation is an effect in Minecraft that causes the effected entity to levitate. The source for levitation is when a shulker shoots a target. The entity will rise 0.9 blocks a second per level of the effect (I = 0.9 blocks, II = 1.8 blocks, III = 2.7 blocks, etc.) while the entity is not swimming or flying. In Java Edition, negative values will cause the entity to float downward, where at level 0 the player will be unable to ascend or descend, where taking damage will launch the player into the air.<br><br>Entities will not take fall damage until levitation wears off. Entities riding (or being inside water and lava in Java Edition) will remain unaffected by levitation. Entities hit by shulkers' shots will get levitation Is-p(Java only) or IIs-p(Bedrock only) for 10 seconds. The ender dragon and the wither are immune to levitation. Flying mobs and the shulker can have the effect, but will remain unaffected. Blazes will float when not hovering.<br><br>Levitation is required for the achievement Great View From Up Here and for the advancements How Did We Get Here? and Great View From Up Here.</div>
