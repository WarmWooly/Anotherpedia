      <h1>Levitation ({{iMinecraft}})</h1>
      <div><<shortElevation-increasing status effect in {{iMinecraft}}short>><<img(src=git/levitation.png(cap=The effect icon for levitation.img>>{{bLevitation}} is an [[effect|effect (Minecraft)]] in {{i[[Minecraft]]}} that causes the effected [[entity|entity (Minecraft)]] to [[levitate|levitation]]. The source for levitation is when a [[shulker|shulker (Minecraft)]] shoots a target. The entity will rise 0.9 [[blocks|block (Minecraft)]] a second per level of the effect (I = 0.9 blocks, II = 1.8 blocks, III = 2.7 blocks, [[etc.|et cetera]]) while the entity is not [[swimming|swimming (Minecraft)]] or [[flying|flying (Minecraft)]]. In [[Java Edition|Minecraft: Java Edition]], negative values will cause the entity to float downward, where at level 0 the player will be unable to ascend or descend, where taking [[damage|damage (Minecraft)]] will launch the player into the air.&pEntities will not take [[fall damage|fall damage (Minecraft)]] until levitation wears off. Entities [[riding|riding (Minecraft)]] (or being inside [[water|water (Minecraft)]] and [[lava|lava (Minecraft)]] in Java Edition) will remain unaffected by levitation. Entities hit by shulkers' shots will get levitation I{{s-p(Java only)}} or II{{s-p(Bedrock only)}} for 10 seconds. The [[ender dragon|ender dragon (Minecraft)]] and the [[wither|wither (Minecraft)]] are immune to levitation. Flying [[mobs|mob (Minecraft)]] and the shulker can have the effect, but will remain unaffected. [[Blazes|blaze (Minecraft)]] will float when not hovering.&pLevitation is required for the [[achievement|achievement (Minecraft)]] [[Great View From Up Here|Great View From Up Here (Minecraft achievement)]] and for the [[advancements|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[How Did We Get Here?|How Did We Get Here? (Minecraft advancement)]] and [[Great View From Up Here|Great View From Up Here (Minecraft advancement)]].</div>
