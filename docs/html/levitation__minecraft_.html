      <h1>Levitation (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>Levitation is an effect (Minecraft) in Minecraft that causes the effected entity (Minecraft) to levitation. The source for levitation is when a shulker (Minecraft) shoots a target. The entity will rise 0.9 block (Minecraft) a second per level of the effect (I = 0.9 blocks, II = 1.8 blocks, III = 2.7 blocks, et cetera) while the entity is not swimming (Minecraft) or flying (Minecraft). In Minecraft: Java Edition, negative values will cause the entity to float downward, where at level 0 the player will be unable to ascend or descend, where taking damage (Minecraft) will launch the player into the air.<br><br>Entities will not take fall damage (Minecraft) until levitation wears off. Entities riding (Minecraft) (or being inside water (Minecraft) and lava (Minecraft) in Java Edition) will remain unaffected by levitation. Entities hit by shulkers' shots will get levitation Is-p(Java only) or IIs-p(Bedrock only) for 10 seconds. The ender dragon (Minecraft) and the wither (Minecraft) are immune to levitation. Flying mob (Minecraft) and the shulker can have the effect, but will remain unaffected. blaze (Minecraft) will float when not hovering.<br><br>Levitation is required for the achievement (Minecraft) Great View From Up Here (Minecraft achievement) and for the advancement (Minecraft) How Did We Get Here? (Minecraft advancement) and Great View From Up Here (Minecraft advancement).</div>
