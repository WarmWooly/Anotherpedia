      <h1>Lie</h1>
      <div>For the action, see lay.<br>A lie is information that is proven to be false. Lies are important forms of information that guide creatures capable of thought in what to think and or feel about events, topics, or other nouns. The opposite of a lie is a fact. A lie can become a fact by proving it to be true. A person who tells lies is called a liar, which is not to be confused with the word lair.</div>
