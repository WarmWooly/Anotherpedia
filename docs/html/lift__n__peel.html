      <h1>Lift 'n' Peel</h1>
      <div>Lift 'n' Peel is a trademarked container seal produced by Selig Group. The seal provides tamper evidence for containers while allowing easy consumer use of the sealed item. A semi-circle plastic tab that can be lifted is used to peel the seal away from a container. Lift 'n' Peel is used to seal a variety of products, including food, drinks, creams and powders for personal care, pills and other medicine, and for various chemicals. Lift 'n' Peel can be used for both glass containers and many types of plastic containers. The optimal way to open a Lift 'n' Peel is to pull the tab sideways to prevent the second layer from sticking to the container.</div>
