  <h1>Lighting</h1>
  <div>Lighting is a light source of light for a decoration or practicality purpose, especially in a defined space such as a room or a venue. Lighting can be natural, primarily sunlight, or artificial lighting, including lamp, light bulb, and digital screen. Lighting increases visibility in the darkness, allowing enclosed locations or areas at night to remain navigable and productive. Lighting may also be purely aesthetic lighting, utilizing vibrant color, specified light pattern, and designs for visual appeal.</div>
