      <h1>Lighting</h1>
      <div>Lighting is a source of light for a decorative or practical purpose, especially in a defined space such as a room or a venue. Lighting can be natural, primarily sunlight, or artificial, including lamps, light bulbs, and screens. Lighting increases visibility in the dark, allowing enclosed locations or areas at night to remain navigable and productive. Lighting may also be purely aesthetic, utilizing vibrant colors, specified light patterns, and designs for visual appeal.</div>
