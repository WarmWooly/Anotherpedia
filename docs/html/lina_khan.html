She gained [[bipartisan]] support in [[Congress|United States Congress]] and the Senate due to her anti-[[Amazon|Amazon (company)]] stance. Both [[Facebook]] and Amazon have filed petitions to the FTC to get Khan [[disqualified|Judicial disqualification]] because of her past experience, which they [[claim]] not to make her [[impartial]].

Afterward, [[The Wall Street Journal]] then [[investigated|investigation]] on Pankey, where they found that she owned [[stock]] in Meta. Because of this, alongside [[Rebecca Slaughter]] and [[Alvaro Bedoya]], Khan issued the following [[joint statement]]:<<quo“Lorielle Pankey is a dedicated, honest, career civil servant who follows the rules set forth by the Office of Government Ethics that apply to ethics officials throughout the federal government. We stand behind and are proud of our career staff. We are extraordinarily lucky to have highly professional and skilled colleagues who tirelessly work to preserve fair competition and protect Americans from unlawful business practices.”quo>>Despite all this, in 2023, [[Within|Within (company)]] merged with Meta after winning a [[lawsuit]] the FTC made to stop the [[merger]].</div>
