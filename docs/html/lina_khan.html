      <h1>Lina Khan</h1>
      <div>Lina Khan was the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, being nominated on June 15, 2021 and terminated on January 20, 2025. She was born on March 3, 1989, in London as a British Pakistani. When she was 11, she moved to the United States with her family. She graduated college in 2010, where she was awarded the Bachelor of Arts. Afterward, she started a career working for the organization New America. She then went to Yale Law School after being offered, where she worked for the Yale Journal on Regulation, and would graduate with a Juris Doctor in 2017. While attending, she got her work "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" into the Yale Law Journal to critical acclaim.

On March 22, 2021, Joe Biden nominated Lina Khan for the position of Chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, where the Senate confirmed with a vote of 69 to 28 on June 15, 2021. She gained bipartisan support in Congress and the Senate due to her anti-Amazon stance. Both Facebook and Amazon have filed petitions to the FTC to get Khan disqualified because of her past experience, which they claim not to make her impartial. Some have seen that these petitions are an attempt by these companies to make Khan back down from her stance against them. She was also questioned on July 13, 2023 about her ability after failing to prevent the acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, where she was defended by Democrats against the Republican-led House.

Lorielle Pankey, the FTC's Designated Agency Ethics Official, allegedly stated in leaked documents for Khan to back away from an anti-competition case against Meta because it would appear to be biased, which Khan and the FTC denied. Afterward, The Wall Street Journal then investigated on Pankey, where they found that she owned stock in Meta. Because of this, alongside Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, Khan issued the following joint statement:“Lorielle Pankey is a dedicated, honest, career civil servant who follows the rules set forth by the Office of Government Ethics that apply to ethics officials throughout the federal government. We stand behind and are proud of our career staff. We are extraordinarily lucky to have highly professional and skilled colleagues who tirelessly work to preserve fair competition and protect Americans from unlawful business practices.”Despite all this, in 2023, Within merged with Meta after winning a lawsuit the FTC made to stop the merger.</div>
