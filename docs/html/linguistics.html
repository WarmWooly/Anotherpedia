      <h1>Linguistics</h1>
      <div>Linguistics is the scientific study of language and the structure, how it evolved, and what they mean. Linguistics has many different branches, including (but not limited to) pragmatics (how a language is used), semantics (the meaning of languages), syntax (how phrases and sentences are made using words in a language), morphology (how words are formed and their relationship to other words), phonology (how sounds are used to form a language), and phonetics (how sounds in a language are produced). Others, such as etymology (the origin of words and phrases), dialectology (how dialects affects and transforms languages), and psycholinguistics (how languages are processed and acquired), also fall under linguistics.</div>
