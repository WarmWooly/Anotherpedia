      <h1>Linguistics</h1>
      <div>Linguistics is the scientific study of language and the structure, how it language evolution, and what they mean. Linguistics has many different branches, including (but not limited to) pragmatics (how a language is used), semantics (the meaning (linguistics) of languages), syntax (how phrase and sentence are made using word in a language), morphology (how words are formed and their relationship to other words), phonology (how sound (linguistics) are used to form a language), and phonetics (how sounds in a language are produced). Others, such as etymology (the origin of words and phrases), dialectology (how dialect affects and transforms languages), and psycholinguistics (how languages are processed and language acquisition), also fall under linguistics.</div>
