      <h1>Liquid (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>A liquid in Mindustry is any resource (both liquids and gasses) that can be collected and transported in conduits. Liquids are used to produce items or other liquids, as ammunition, to increase the speed of buildings, or to make new units. Liquids can't be stored in the Core, but they can be stored in containers (such as a Liquid Tank). There are currently 10 unique liquids: Arkycite, Cryofluid, Cyanogen, Hydrogen, Neoplasm, Nitrogen, Oil, Slag, and Water.</div>
