      <h1>Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>Liquid ethylene is a liquid (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Mekanism. It can be stored in Fluid Tank (Mekanism) and transported with mechanical pipe (Mekanism).



In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain liquid ethylene:<br>1 millibucket Ethylene (Mekanism) --> 1 mB Liquid Ethylene



In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with liquid ethylene:<br>50 mB Liquid Ethylene + 10 mB Oxygen (Mekanism) + 1 Substrate (Mekanism) --> 1 HDPE Pellet (Mekanism) + 5 mB Oxygen (Mekanism)

In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with liquid ethylene:<br>1 mB Liquid Ethylene --> 1 mB Ethylene (Mekanism)</div>
