      <h1>Lithosphere</h1>
      <div>The lithosphere is the outermost layer of a terrestrial planet or natural satellite, which on Earth, is composed of the crust (geology) and the lithospheric mantle above the upper mantle. The Earth's crust may also be separated into the continental crust and the oceanic crust. The determination between the lithosphere and the upper mantle is based on the chemical composition of the layers as determined through mineralogy. The layer above the lithosphere is the atmosphere, containing any gas on the celestial body (if any).</div>
