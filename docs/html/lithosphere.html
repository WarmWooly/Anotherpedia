The Earth's crust may also be separated into the [[continental crust]] and the [[oceanic crust]]. The determination between the lithosphere and the upper mantle is based on the [[chemical composition]] of the layers as determined through [[mineralogy]]. The layer above the lithosphere is the [[atmosphere]], containing any [[gasses|gas]] on the [[celestial body]] (if any).</div>
