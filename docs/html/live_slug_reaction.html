      <h1>Live Slug Reaction</h1>
      <div>Live Slug Reaction, also known as Live Klaud Reaction, refers to the meme of Klaud from Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker reacting to some form of content, based on the Live Tucker Reaction meme. Typically content being reacted to by Klaud has two or more characters being romantic with each other, such as hugging or kissing.
A popular variation of the meme, occasionally called Live Gastrodon Reaction, replaces Klaud with the sea slug Pokémon Gastrodon, with either form being used.</div>
