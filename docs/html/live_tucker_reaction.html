      <h1>Live Tucker Reaction</h1>
      <div>Live Tucker Reaction is a meme of when former Fox News political commentator Tucker Carlson was shown in a small box off to the bottom right corner of Joe Biden's first speech in March of 2021 which was airing on Tucker Carlson Tonight, where viewers could see in real-time Carlson's reaction to the speech. During the speech, Carlson was often puzzled, where he would occasionally nod or shake his head. It spread across platforms such as iFunny, mainly due to the versatility of the Live X Reaction snowclone and the humor that could be produced by making it seem like a notable or recognizable figure or character was watching and reacting to other known content.
