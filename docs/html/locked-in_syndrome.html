      <h1>Locked-in Syndrome</h1>
      <div><<nomedical>>Locked-in Syndrome (LiS) is a disorder to the nervous system who are paralyzed  but are still able to control their eyelids and are still conscious (despite being unable to speak). This rare disorder may arise from a traumatic brain injury, overdosing on medication, a disease in the circulatory system, or a disease that damages and destroys the myelin sheath of nerve cells, which in turn affect the pons on the brainstem. Most people with LiS can still communicate through moving their eyes or eyelids. LiS is found to be most common in people between 30 and 50.</div>
