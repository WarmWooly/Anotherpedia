The logs that the Log Sweeper shoots are relatively fast and large, punishing those who stay on flat ground. However, the tradeoff is the inability to hit targets above or significantly below the user. The Log Sweeper gradually reduces its reload time from 1 second down to 0.2 seconds by 0.05 seconds every time a log is rolled, increasing its danger over time. Unequipping the Log Sweeper resets the reload decrease. Killing someone with the Log Sweeper will award the badge (Roblox) Sweeping the Competition (Laser Fight).
