  <h1>Logarithm</h1>
  <div>The logarithm, often shortened to log, is an inverse function in mathematics of exponentiation. The logarithm has a number, x, and a base, b, which is shown as logs-b{{ib}}(x). 
It can be thought of a way to get the exponent needed for b to be raised to x. For example, 3s-u2 = 9, so logs-b3(9) = 2. This means that ns-ulog{{s-b{{in}}(x)}} = x (a number n to the power of the logarithm with the base n to the number x will equal x), and 3s-ulog{{s-b3(9)}} = 9. Logarithms without a written base, such as log(100), have a base of 10. This means log(100) = logs-b10(100) = 2.</div>
