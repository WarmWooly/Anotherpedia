  <h1>Logarithm</h1>
  <div>The {{blogarithm}}, often shortened to {{blog}}, is an inverse function in mathematics of exponentiation. The logarithm has a number, {{ix}}, and a base, {{ib}}, which is shown as log{{s-b{{ib}}}}({{ix}}). 
It can be thought of a way to get the exponent needed for {{ib}} to be raised to {{ix}}. For example, 3{{s-u2}} = 9, so log{{s-b3}}(9) = 2. This means that {{in}}{{s-ulog{{s-b{{in}}}}({{ix}})}} = {{ix}} (a number {{in}} to the power of the logarithm with the base {{in}} to the number {{ix}} will equal {{ix}}), and 3{{s-ulog{{s-b3}}(9)}} = 9. Logarithms without a written base, such as log(100), have a base of 10. This means log(100) = log{{s-b10}}(100) = 2.</div>
