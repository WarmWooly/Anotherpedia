      <h1>Looksmaxxing</h1>
      <div>Looksmaxxing, also written as looksmaxing, is the process of a man optimizing their facial features to be more attractive towards women. This often involves skincare, sleeping, mewing, working out, and teeth whitening. Looksmaxxing may also include clothing and hairstyle. Another "tactic" is known as bone smashing, but it is widely controversial. Looksmaxxing originated from the platform TikTok. There has been little to no proof of looksmaxxing improving the shape or skin quality of looksmaxxers. Looksmaxxers may mog other looksmaxxers or men to prove their own dominance.</div>
