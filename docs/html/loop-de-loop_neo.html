      <h1>Loop-de-loop neo</h1>
      <div>A loop-de-loop neo is a joke neo jump in Minecraft in the spoof on Parkour Civilization titled "Parkour Civilization be like" from div_y, where the "parkour champion" pulls out the loop-de-loop neo to attack Eggbo.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P4tikVJpD0(text=refCountref>> A loop-de-loop neo could not be achieved in Survival Mode (Minecraft) because the jump requires Creative flight (Minecraft) to go all the way around the loop-de-loop. The absurdity of such a jump is what makes it comedic, with the parkour champion just flying around it.
Eggbo (internal monologuing): But then, he used the illegal parkour my friend warned me about.&spParkour champion: Watch this, Eggbo!&sp[The parkour champion jumps, flies around a wooden loop-de-loop, then lands on the other side.]&spEggbo (internal monologuing): Then, he did a loop-de-loop neo! The battle was over.&spParkour champion: What are you going to do, NOW?&spEggbo (internal monologuing): Now there was only one jump I could do to defeat the champion.</div>
