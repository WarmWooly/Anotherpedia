  <h1>Loop ({{iGrass Cutting Incremental}})</h1>
  <div><<shortThe first new game+ progression stage in {{iGCI}}short>><<img(src=git/loop gci.png(cap=The image for the [[badge|Badge (Roblox)]] obtained by the player after performing their first loop.img>>{{bLoops}} are the [[first]] Loop [[layer]] of the [[Universe 1|Universe 1 (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] [[new game+]] in the game {{i[[Grass Cutting Incremental]]}}. By performing a Loop, the player will obtain a [[currency]] called [[Looplets|Looplet (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]. The player will also unlock the [[Loop Tower|Loop Tower (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]. After performing a Loop, the player will be brought back to the start of game progression. The multiplier provided by all tiers of Loops is called the {{bLoop Multiplier}}. The Loop Multiplier is calculated by the game like this:<<quoOmega Loops * (Super Ultra Mega Loops * (Super Mega Loops * (Mega Loops * Loops)))quo>>There are Looplet upgrades for all tiers of Loops that increase the Loop Multiplier, calculated as: <<quoOmega Loopier Loops * (Super Ultra Mega Loopier Loops * (Super Mega Loopier Loops * (Mega Loopier Loops * (Loopier Loops * Loop Multiplier)))).quo>><<hrBonuseshr>>For each Loop, a multiplier for almost everything in the game will be increased by 1 per Loop. In some cases, this will divide instead of multiply, such as with The Dark Tree fruit grow timer and Rocket Part requirements for performing a [[Galactic|Galactic (Grass Cutting Incremental)]].<<hr2Things unaffected By Loopshr2>>;;Everything from [[autocut|Autocut (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Accomplishments|Accomplishments (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|Grow speed|Grass cap|[[Compaction|Compaction (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|Levels|[[Tiers|Tier (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Grasshop|Grasshop (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Grass-Skip|Grass-Skip (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Planetary Trials|Planetary Trials (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Grass Jump|Grass Jump (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Charger|Charger (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] bonuses|[[Dark Charger|Dark Charger (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] bonuses|[[Astral|Astral (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Anti-Grasshop|Anti-Grasshop (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Astral Prestige|Astral Prestige (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Lunar Obelisk|Lunar Obelisk (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Reservatorium|Reservatorium (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Lines|Lines (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] on [[Constellation|Constellation (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|All Constellations (except for Generators, Arc Generators, Stabilizers, and Reinforcements)|[[Singularity|Centralize (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Planet Run|Planet Run (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Supernova|Supernova (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] Tier|Solar Idler|Supernova Requirements|Solar Flares cap|[[Eclipse|Eclipse (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Solarian|Solarians (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] Stages|Solarian Power|Soul Bonuses|Divine Soul Bonuses|Unstable Soul Bonuses|Flare Shards|Empty Gems|Twilight Bonuses|Solarian Challenges|Darkness|Infinity Loops|[[Grassland|Grassland (Grass Cutting Incremental)]] Gem|Combat Rank|Cutting|Health|Mastery|Looplets|Loops per Loop|Lime Charger bonuses|Arrows|[[Blue|Bluestige (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|Irridium|[[Plasma|Plasmaficate (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Grass-Touch|Grass-Touch (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[True End|True End (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|Upgrade Costs|Upgrade Boosts|Player Walk Speed|Player Jump Height|Time Warps|[[Flowers|Flowers (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Rare Flowers|Rare Flowers (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|[[Goals|Goals (Grass Cutting Incremental)]]|Auto Accomplishments|Game Tickspeed|Autobuyer;;</div>
