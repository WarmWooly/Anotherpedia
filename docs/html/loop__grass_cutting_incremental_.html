      <h1>Loop (Grass Cutting Incremental)</h1>
      <div>Loops are the first Loop layer of the Universe 1 new game+ in the game Grass Cutting Incremental. By performing a Loop, the player will obtain a currency called Looplets. The player will also unlock the Loop Tower. After performing a Loop, the player will be brought back to the start of game progression. The multiplier provided by all tiers of Loops is called the Loop Multiplier. The Loop Multiplier is calculated by the game like this:Omega Loops * (Super Ultra Mega Loops * (Super Mega Loops * (Mega Loops * Loops)))There are Looplet upgrades for all tiers of Loops that increase the Loop Multiplier, calculated as: Omega Loopier Loops * (Super Ultra Mega Loopier Loops * (Super Mega Loopier Loops * (Mega Loopier Loops * (Loopier Loops * Loop Multiplier)))).

For each Loop, a multiplier for almost everything in the game will be increased by 1 per Loop. In some cases, this will divide instead of multiply, such as with The Dark Tree fruit grow timer and Rocket Part requirements for performing a Galactic.
