      <h1>Loose Deepened Stone (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Loose deepened stones are an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail obtained from sieving as a piece of cobbled deepslate.



Loose deepened stones can be collected by sieving deepened gravel with an iron sieve mesh (6% chance) or a rose gold sieve mesh (12% chance). Separation can increase the chance/drops of loose deepened stones from sieving.



4 loose deepened stones can be crafted in a 2x2 square to make cobbled deepslate.

Loose deepened stones are used in the following melding recipes:<br>Rocky Leather Padding - 2 loose deepened stones and 1 leather padding

Main page: Chain Launcher ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}<br>When held in the offhand, the loose deepened stone can be launched from a chain launcher. When the loose deepened stone impacts a block, it drops to the ground. If the hit block is glass, the glass block will break. The loose deepened stone deals damage to hit mobs. If a player increases their Rockiness with rocky leather paddings, the damage dealt from a launched loose deepened stone increases. If a Skeleton, Stray, Skeleton Horse, Wither Skeleton, or the Wither is hit with a launched loose deepened stone, the advancement Sticks and Stones is awarded.</div>
