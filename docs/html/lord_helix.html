      <div><<shortTPP Helix Fossil/Omanyte/Omastarshort>><<img(src=git/lord helix.png(cap=Lord Helix as an Omanyte with a Helix Fossil as the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus|Sacred Heart]].<<ref(content=link|https://imgur.com/gallery/praise-lord-helix-WQ7YNVe(text=refCountref>>img>>{{bLord Helix}} was a [[Helix Fossil|Helix Fossil (Pokémon)]]/[[Omanyte]]/[[Omastar]]-turned [[meme]] from [[Twitch Plays {{iPokémon}}]] (TPP) of the game {{i[[Pokémon Red]]}} in 2014. Lord Helix originated as a Helix Fossil found during TPP in [[Mt. Moon|Mt. Moon (Pokémon Red)]] picked over the [[Dome Fossil|Dome Fossil (Pokémon)]]. Lord Helix was closely tied to [[Christianity]] throughout its involvement in TPP, such as its titles of "Lord" or "God" and the phrase "Praise Helix!"<<ref(content=link|https://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/article/view/23549(text=refCountref>> While the fossil itself was useless, [[Twitch Chat]] would repeatedly use the item. Despite originating from accidental inputs, the action was later warped into [[consulting]] or [[worshipping|worship]] the fossil. Upon being [[revived|fossil revival (Pokémon)]] into an Omanyte, Lord Helix's role within the TPP community would grow as a central [[character]], especially when it came to [[released|releasing (Pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] being "sacrificed" to Lord Helix. Lord Helix would later [[evolve|evolution (Pokémon)]] into Omastar, which would be taken through the [[Elite Four]] and against [[BLUE|BLUE (Pokémon Red)]] (despite being [[fainted|fainting (Pokémon)]] for the final battle).<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG2Dc2bp4oU(text=refCountref>> Lord Helix would end as [[level|leveling (Pokémon)]] 52.&pSince Twitch Plays {{iPokémon}}, Lord Helix has been a popular meme and recurring character. Various [[fan artworks|fan artwork]], [[wiki pages|fan wiki page]], and [[inside jokes|inside joke]], both about Lord Helix and the [[Church of Helix]], would be spurred by the character. Its notability has spread outside of TPP and into the broader [[{{iPokémon}} community]] when discussing the Helix Fossil, Omanyte, or Omastar.</div>
