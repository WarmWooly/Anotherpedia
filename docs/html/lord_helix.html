  <h1>Lord Helix</h1>
  <div>{{bLord Helix}} was a Helix Fossil (Pokémon)/Omanyte/Omastar-turned meme from Twitch Plays {{iPokémon}} (TPP) of the game {{iPokémon Red}} in 2014. Lord Helix originated as a Helix Fossil found during TPP in Mt. Moon (Pokémon Red) picked over the Dome Fossil (Pokémon). Lord Helix was closely tied to Christianity throughout its involvement in TPP, such as its titles of "Lord" or "God" and the phrase "Praise Helix!"<<ref(content=link|https://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/article/view/23549(text=refCountref>> While the fossil itself was useless, Twitch Chat would repeatedly use the item. Despite originating from accidental inputs, the action was later warped into consulting or worship the fossil. Upon being fossil revival (Pokémon) into an Omanyte, Lord Helix's role within the TPP community would grow as a central character, especially when it came to releasing (Pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) being "sacrificed" to Lord Helix. Lord Helix would later evolution (Pokémon) into Omastar, which would be taken through the Elite Four and against BLUE (Pokémon Red) (despite being fainting (Pokémon) for the final battle).<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG2Dc2bp4oU(text=refCountref>> Lord Helix would end as leveling (Pokémon) 52.&pSince Twitch Plays {{iPokémon}}, Lord Helix has been a popular meme and recurring character. Various fan artwork, fan wiki page, and inside joke, both about Lord Helix and the Church of Helix, would be spurred by the character. Its notability has spread outside of TPP and into the broader {{iPokémon}} community when discussing the Helix Fossil, Omanyte, or Omastar.</div>
