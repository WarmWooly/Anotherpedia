      <h1>Lord Helix</h1>
      <div>Lord Helix was a Helix Fossil/Omanyte/Omastar-turned meme from Twitch Plays Pokémon (TPP) of the game Pokémon Red in 2014. Lord Helix originated as a Helix Fossil found during TPP in Mt. Moon picked over the Dome Fossil. Lord Helix was closely tied to Christianity throughout its involvement in TPP, such as its titles of "Lord" or "God" and the phrase "Praise Helix!"<<ref(content=link|https://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/article/view/23549(text=refCountref>> While the fossil itself was useless, Twitch Chat would repeatedly use the item. Despite originating from accidental inputs, the action was later warped into consulting or worshipping the fossil. Upon being revived into an Omanyte, Lord Helix's role within the TPP community would grow as a central character, especially when it came to released Pokémon being "sacrificed" to Lord Helix. Lord Helix would later evolve into Omastar, which would be taken through the Elite Four and against BLUE (despite being fainted for the final battle).<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG2Dc2bp4oU(text=refCountref>> Lord Helix would end as level 52.&pSince Twitch Plays Pokémon, Lord Helix has been a popular meme and recurring character. Various fan artworks, wiki pages, and inside jokes, both about Lord Helix and the Church of Helix, would be spurred by the character. Its notability has spread outside of TPP and into the broader Pokémon community when discussing the Helix Fossil, Omanyte, or Omastar.</div>
