      <h1>Loss (meme)</h1>
      <div>Loss refers to the internet meme about the webcomic "Loss (comic)" by Tim Buckley in Ctrl+Alt+Del (webcomic) which depicts the protagonist Ethan (CAD) finding out that his fiancée Lilah (CAD) had a miscarridge. The tonal shift made it become a popular meme, where it would either use character and scene from different show, movie, or franchise, or attempt to be hidden in plain sight utilizing the "minimalist version". This variation consists of seven line which convey the four comic panel, with Ethan, then Ethan talking to the receptionist, then Ethan with the doctor, and lastly Ethan overlooking Lilah.</div>
