      <h1>Loss (meme)</h1>
      <div>Loss refers to the meme about the webcomic "Loss" by Tim Buckley in Ctrl+Alt+Del which depicts the protagonist Ethan finding out that his fiancée Lilah had a miscarridge. The tonal shift made it become a popular meme, where it would either use characters and scenes from different shows, movies, or franchises, or attempt to be hidden in plain sight utilizing the "minimalist version". This variation consists of seven lines which convey the four panels, with Ethan, then Ethan talking to the receptionist, then Ethan with the doctor, and lastly Ethan overlooking Lilah.</div>
