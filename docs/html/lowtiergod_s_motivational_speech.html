      <h1>LowTierGod's motivational speech</h1>
      <div>LowTierGod's motivational speech or "You should treat yourself NOW!" is a copypasta based on LowTierGod's rant telling a chatter in his streams that "You should kill yourself NOW!" Instead of goading suicide, LowTierGod's motivational speech instead pushes for the chatter to go an treat themselves with their fulfilling life.

The copypasta likely originated in r/copypasta on Reddit posted by the user TrueFaceVEVO on September 26, 2021. The copypasta reads:Your life is EVERYTHING! You serve ALL PURPOSE! You should treat yourself NOW! And give yourself, a piece of that oxygen, in the ozone layer, that's covered up so then you can breathe in this blue trapped bubble! 'Cause you know I'm here for it! To worship YOU! Love YOURSELF! I mean that with a hundred percent! With a thousand percent!Ardeact would create a YouTube video using the copypasta on December 11, 2021, having an edited image of LowTierGod smiling in a flower-filled field as the song "Infinity of our Love" played in the background.</div>
