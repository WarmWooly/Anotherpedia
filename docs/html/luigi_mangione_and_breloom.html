      <h1>Luigi Mangione and Breloom</h1>
      <div>Luigi Mangione, the main suspect for the killing of Brian Thompson, has been connected to the Pokémon Breloom during online efforts to try and uncover as much information about Luigi as possible. The Twitter account <<link(src=https://x.com/pepmangione?lang=en(text=@PepMangionelink>>, an account that has been connected to Luigi, has the official artwork of Breloom among two other images. Sleuths have taken multiple meanings from Breloom to find any cryptic meaning behind its inclusion among Luigi's online identity.

286, the Pokédex number for Breloom, has been linked to Bible verses and the insurance denial code in an attempt to connect Breloom with Luigi's motive from the killing. More loosely, the following count for his cousin Nino Mangione's Twitter (which now doesn't match) and the supposed distance from the killing and the McDonald's he was caught at were also 286-linked. Proverbs 28:6, a verse from the Book of Proverbs, reads "Better the poor whose walk is blameless than the rich whose ways are perverse." Luigi has been attributed as the "poor" in this context, with Brian Thompson as the "rich" from that Bible verse. The insurance denial code 286 is also linked with Breloom and Luigi, but multiple systems and definitions make it hard to pinpoint exactly what it could mean. The explanation from MD Clarity, the top result when Googling "286 denial code", says that 286 means "the appeal time limits for a claim have not been met." While the number 286 has been used to vaguely connect multiple elements of the killing of Brian Thompson and Luigi Mangione's life, the conspiracy theory is tenuous at best. Realistically, any other Pokémon would have undergone the same level of scrutiny and conspiracy as Breloom if it was placed in the same spot.

Following the connection between Luigi Mangione and Breloom, fan art related to the two was created. This comes in the forms of Luigi depicted as a Breloom and the Mario character Luigi (or Luigi Mangione dressed as Luigi) with a Breloom.</div>
