  <h1>Lunk Alarm</h1>
  <div>For the song, see Lunk Alarm (song).&spThe Lunk Alarm is an alarm in Planet Fitness for when rowdy or disrespectful people are kicked off the premises for being a "lunk". It is surrounded by a large purple gear with a blue electric light in the middle, alongside the text LUNK ALARM at the top in white and Lunk (lunk) n. [slang] one who grunts, drops weights or judges. {{i[Ricky is slamming his weights, wearing a body building tank top and drinking out of a gallon water jug... what a lunk!]}} at the bottom in yellow.&pThe main goal of the Lunk Alarm is to make the place more friendly to beginner and casual, the target demographic of Planet Fitness.
The overall reception for the Lunk Alarm has been negative reception because of the way that it pushes away people who are more fit or muscular, while also punishing those wearing attire that seems "lunk-like" and having water bottle that are a gallon.</div>
