      <h1>M1006 sponge grenade</h1>
      <div>The M1006 sponge grenade, also known as the M1006 sponge round, is a 40x46mm non-lethal sponge grenade used for crowd control. It is comprised of a shell and a solid foam tip (usually a lime green or deep blue), which can be launched up to 50 ft away.<br><br>It is recommended to give at least 10-15 ft of clearance before firing, as the round at short distances can be potentially lethal because it has a muzzle velocity of over 250 ft/s. The M1006 is made to not produce shrapnel and to not penetrate the target, but rather stun and disorient the target. Small grenade launchers such as the M79 often use M1006 grenades.</div>
