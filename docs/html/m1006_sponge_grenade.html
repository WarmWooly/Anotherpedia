      <h1>M1006 sponge grenade</h1>
      <div>The M1006 sponge grenade, also known as the M1006 sponge round, is a 40mm grenade non-lethal round sponge grenade used for crowd control. It is comprised of a grenade shell and a solid foam tip (usually a lime green or deep blue), which can be launched up to 50 foot (unit) away.&pIt is recommended to give at least 10-15 ft of clearance before firing, as the round at short distances can be potentially lethal because it has a muzzle velocity of over 250 feet per second. The M1006 is made to not produce shrapnel and to not bullet penetration the target, but rather stun and disorientation the target. Small grenade launcher such as the M79 grenade launcher often use M1006 grenades.</div>
