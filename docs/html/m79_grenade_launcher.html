  <h1>M79 grenade launcher</h1>
  <div><<shortSingle-shot grenade launcher from 1961short>>{{tFor other uses of the term M79, see [[M79 firearm (disambiguation)]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/m79 grenade launcher.jpg(cap=An M79 grenade launcher.img>>The {{bM79 grenade launcher}} is a [[single-shot]] [[break-action|break action]] [[grenade launcher]] which fires [[40x46mm grenades|40mm grenade]] that was first put into use in 1961 during the [[Vietnam War]]. It utilized a [[high–low system]] to launch the [[grenades|grenade]] further while keeping the M79 lighter. The M79 has been in a plethora of [[conflicts|armed conflict]], such as in the [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia]], the [[Falklands War]], the [[Afghan War|War in Afghanistan]], and the [[Iraq War]], and <<asofJuly 2024>> it is still in service. The creation of the M79 was the result of [[Project NIBLICK]] from the [[US Army|United States Army]] to develop a modern grenade launcher. The M79 was one of the major stepping stones toward the [[China Lake grenade launcher]], a [[pump-action|pump action]] grenade launcher of a similar design.&p<<img(src=git/m79 spinning.gif(cap=A [[3D model]] of an M79 being prepared for loading.(leftImgimg>>It has a [[muzzle velocity]] of 76 [[m/s|meters per second]] (247 [[ft/s|feet per second]]), an [[effective firing range]] of 350 [[m|meter]] (383 [[yd|yard (unit)]]), and a [[maximum firing range]] of 400 m (437 yd). It's [[ammo|ammunition]] is [[breach-loaded|breechloader]] (from the back). It uses a [[wood]] or [[fiberglass]] [[stock|stock (firearms)]], a [[blade sight]], and a [[leaf sight]] which can be set between 75 and 375 meters (82 to 410 yards). The operation of the M79 is quite simple, where the user pushes the barrel lock to the right, opening the break action. The round is then loaded and the action is manually closed, where the [[safety|safety (firearms)]] must be pushed forward before firing.<<hrAmmunitionhr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0U2U-CD7MM(cap=A [[YouTube]] [[video]] by [[Vickers Tactical]] about the M79.yt>>The M79's ammunition are 40mm grenades. Its most used grenade is the [[M406 40mm HE (high explosive) grenade|M406 40mm HE grenade]] that could travel to over 1,500 m/s with over 300 [[fragments|fragment (explosives)]] launched in a single shot, with a [[lethal radius]] of 5 meters (16 [[feet|foot (unit)]]). For close-range encounters, the M79 originally used a [[flechette round]] of 45 10-grain steel [[flechettes|flechette]], but it proved ineffective because the flechettes would spin horizontally and bounce off the target. Afterward, the [[M576E1|M576 40mm grenade]] and E2 were developed, with 20 and 27 24-grain metal pellets respectively. Despite the increased pellet count, the [[spread|bullet spread]] of the E2 made it more ineffective compared to the E1. Some [[non-lethal rounds|non-lethal round]] used for [[crowd control]] included the [[M1029 Crowd Dispersal rounds|M1029 Crowd Dispersal round]] ([[rubber bullets|rubber bullet]]), the [[M1006 sponge grenade]], and the [[M651 CS gas]].<<hrNicknameshr>>The M79 was adorned with many different [[nicknames|nickname]] during its use, including:;;"Big Ed"|"Bloop Tube"|"Blooper"|"Can Cannon"|"Elephant Gun"|"Thump-Gun"|"Thumper"|"Wombat Gun";;</div>
