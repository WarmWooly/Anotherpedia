      <h1>M79 grenade launcher</h1>
      <div>For other uses of the term M79, see M79 firearm (disambiguation).<br>The M79 grenade launcher is a single-shot break-action grenade launcher which fires 40x46mm grenades that was first put into use in 1961 during the Vietnam War. It utilized a high–low system to launch the grenades further while keeping the M79 lighter. The M79 has been in a plethora of conflicts, such as in the Communist insurgency in Malaysia, the Falklands War, the Afghan War, and the Iraq War, and <<asofJuly 2024>> it is still in service. The creation of the M79 was the result of Project NIBLICK from the US Army to develop a modern grenade launcher. The M79 was one of the major stepping stones toward the China Lake grenade launcher, a pump-action grenade launcher of a similar design.<br><br>It has a muzzle velocity of 76 m/s (247 ft/s), an effective firing range of 350 m (383 yd), and a maximum firing range of 400 m (437 yd). It's ammo is breach-loaded (from the back). It uses a wood or fiberglass stock, a blade sight, and a leaf sight which can be set between 75 and 375 meters (82 to 410 yards). The operation of the M79 is quite simple, where the user pushes the barrel lock to the right, opening the break action. The round is then loaded and the action is manually closed, where the safety must be pushed forward before firing.

The M79's ammunition are 40mm grenades. Its most used grenade is the M406 40mm HE (high explosive) grenade that could travel to over 1,500 m/s with over 300 fragments launched in a single shot, with a lethal radius of 5 meters (16 feet). For close-range encounters, the M79 originally used a flechette round of 45 10-grain steel flechettes, but it proved ineffective because the flechettes would spin horizontally and bounce off the target. Afterward, the M576E1 and E2 were developed, with 20 and 27 24-grain metal pellets respectively. Despite the increased pellet count, the spread of the E2 made it more ineffective compared to the E1. Some non-lethal rounds used for crowd control included the M1029 Crowd Dispersal rounds (rubber bullets), the M1006 sponge grenade, and the M651 CS gas.

The M79 was adorned with many different nicknames during its use, including:;;"Big Ed"|"Bloop Tube"|"Blooper"|"Can Cannon"|"Elephant Gun"|"Thump-Gun"|"Thumper"|"Wombat Gun";;</div>
