  <h1>M79 grenade launcher</h1>
  <div>{{tFor other uses of the term M79, see M79 firearm (disambiguation).}}&spThe {{bM79 grenade launcher}} is a single-shot break action grenade launcher which fires 40mm grenade that was first put into use in 1961 during the Vietnam War. It utilized a high–low system to launch the grenade further while keeping the M79 lighter. The M79 has been in a plethora of armed conflict, such as in the Communist insurgency in Malaysia, the Falklands War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War, and <<asofJuly 2024>> it is still in service. The creation of the M79 was the result of Project NIBLICK from the United States Army to develop a modern grenade launcher. The M79 was one of the major stepping stones toward the China Lake grenade launcher, a pump action grenade launcher of a similar design.&pIt has a muzzle velocity of 76 meters per second (247 feet per second), an effective firing range of 350 meter (383 yard (unit)), and a maximum firing range of 400 m (437 yd). It's ammunition is breechloader (from the back). It uses a wood or fiberglass stock (firearms), a blade sight, and a leaf sight which can be set between 75 and 375 meters (82 to 410 yards). The operation of the M79 is quite simple, where the user pushes the barrel lock to the right, opening the break action. The round is then loaded and the action is manually closed, where the safety (firearms) must be pushed forward before firing.
The M79's ammunition are 40mm grenades. Its most used grenade is the M406 40mm HE grenade that could travel to over 1,500 m/s with over 300 fragment (explosives) launched in a single shot, with a lethal radius of 5 meters (16 foot (unit)). For close-range encounters, the M79 originally used a flechette round of 45 10-grain steel flechette, but it proved ineffective because the flechettes would spin horizontally and bounce off the target. Afterward, the M576 40mm grenade and E2 were developed, with 20 and 27 24-grain metal pellets respectively. Despite the increased pellet count, the bullet spread of the E2 made it more ineffective compared to the E1. Some non-lethal round used for crowd control included the M1029 Crowd Dispersal round (rubber bullet), the M1006 sponge grenade, and the M651 CS gas.
The M79 was adorned with many different nickname during its use, including:;;"Big Ed"|"Bloop Tube"|"Blooper"|"Can Cannon"|"Elephant Gun"|"Thump-Gun"|"Thumper"|"Wombat Gun";;</div>
