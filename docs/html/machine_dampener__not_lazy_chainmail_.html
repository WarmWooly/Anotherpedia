The machine dampener can be crafted with 1 wool and 8 planks (place the wool in the center and surround with planks). Crafting the machine dampener will award the advancement Peace and Quiet.
Machines that are within 3 blocks of the machine dampener will be only 20% as loud. This feature is most useful when creating automatic setups near a base, as the machines can be noisy.
In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 machine dampener can fuel for 120 seconds (12 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (64 machine dampeners, 7680 seconds, 768 items).</div>
