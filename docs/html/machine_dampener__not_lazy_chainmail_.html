      <div>For the block that mutes the sound, see Machine Muffler ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}<br><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Axe (Minecraft) preferred)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|0.6||hardness (Minecraft)|0.2||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The machine dampener is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to reduce the sound made by machines placed nearby.



The machine dampener can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 wool (Minecraft) and 8 planks (Minecraft) (place the wool in the center and surround with planks). Crafting the machine dampener will award the advancement (Minecraft) Peace and Quiet (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Machines that are within 3 blocks of the machine dampener will be only 20% as loud. This feature is most useful when creating automatic setups near a base, as the machines can be noisy.

In a furnace (Minecraft), blast furnace (Minecraft), or smoker (Minecraft), 1 machine dampener can fuel for 120 second (12 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (Minecraft) (64 machine dampeners, 7680 seconds, 768 items).</div>
