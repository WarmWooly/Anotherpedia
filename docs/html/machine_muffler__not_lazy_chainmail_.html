      <div>For the block that reduces the sound, but doesn't mute it, see Machine Dampener ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}<br><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Pickaxe (Minecraft) preferred)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|1||hardness (Minecraft)|0.3||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The machine muffler is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to silence machines placed nearby.



The machine muffler can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 wool (Minecraft) and 8 cobblestone (Minecraft) (place the wool in the center and surround with cobblestone). Crafting the machine muffler will award the advancement (Minecraft) Peace and Quiet (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Machines that are within 3 blocks of the machine muffler will be muted. This feature is most useful when creating automatic setups near a base, as the machines can be noisy.</div>
