The machine muffler can be crafted with 1 wool and 8 cobblestone (place the wool in the center and surround with cobblestone). Crafting the machine muffler will award the advancement Peace and Quiet.
Machines that are within 3 blocks of the machine muffler will be muted. This feature is most useful when creating automatic setups near a base, as the machines can be noisy.</div>
