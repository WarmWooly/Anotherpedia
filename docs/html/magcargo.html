  <div>Magcargo is a magma snail fire type (pokémon) and Rock type (pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation II (Pokémon).
Magcargo is reddish-orange or bright red with a gray shell and a pair of yellow eyes. The area around its foot is covered in boiling magma, while its face is adorned with thick drip-like structures extending past the mouth. The shell is comprised of multiple stone plates of varying shapes and sizes, with a hole in Magcargo's shell emitting a burning flame.&pMagcargo's official size is 2 foot (unit) and 7 inch, while weighing 121.3 pound. Shiny (Pokémon) Magcargo are magenta instead of red with a bronze shell.&pMagcargo's name comes from magma and escargot (French language for snail).
Magcargo tends to inhabit volcanic crater, using the magma inside to sustain its body for thousands of years. Its shell, formed from its skin cooling, is quite brittle, and when disturbed, creates a hole for fire to erupt from. Magcargo's temperature idles around 18,000 &degFahrenheit (~6-7x as hot as normal magma), with water boiling instantly into water vapor on contact (such as Magcargo being in the rain).
A Magcargo has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Magcargo is the 219th Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color red.&pMagcargo evolution (pokémon) from Slugma (Pokémon) at leveling (pokémon) 38.</div>
