      <h1>Magcargo Pokemon</h1>
      <div>"Magcargo Pokemon" is a spoken word song by Penny Bank released on December 27, 2022. The song is about the Pokémon (fictional species) Magcargo.

Magcargo, the second stage of a Slugma<br>This is what a Slugma evolves into<br>Hard name to pronounce, Mag-cargo, but it's all one word, Mag-Magcargo<br>Wow, this is cool-looking<br>It has a shell now<br>It is on fire<br>It looks like a bomb about to burst on its back<br>This also looks very happy<br>The, uh, the Slugma looked like it didn't know what was going on in life<br>The Magcargo looks pretty happy<br>I guess it's got that shell to retreat into so it's, uh, happier about that<br>Let's read<br>Magcargo's shell is actually its skin that hardened as a result of cooling, uh-oh<br>As we learned with the Slugma, that's not good<br>Let's see what happens<br>It's shell is very brittle and fragile<br>Just touching it causes it to crumble apart<br>This Pokémon returns to its original size by dipping itself in magma<br>Ok, so if its shell breaks, it's not a problem, it just has to re-constitute the magma and then it's all good<br>That's what I think is happening here<br>Magcargo</div>
