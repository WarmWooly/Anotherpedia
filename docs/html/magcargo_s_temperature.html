      <h1>Magcargo's temperature</h1>
      <div>Magcargo's temperature, as said in the Pokédex, is "roughly" 18,000 &degF (~10,000 &degC), making it the hottest Pokémon alongside Camerupt. While its body is made of magma, its temperature far exceeds the normal 2,700 &degF (1,500 &degC) of magma, often compared with the heat of the Sun's surface at 10,000 &degF (5,500 &degC). An explanation for Magcargo's reported temperature is that the Pokédex is erroneous, as seen by comparing the environmental effects of Magcargo versus the actual outcome of a 120 pound mass of 18,000 &degF on the environment. This can be backed up with how Magcargo's temperature exceeds that of the vaporization temperatures of common rock types that make up the Earth's crust (ex. limestone vaporizes between 6080 &degF and 6550 &degF or 3360 &degC and 3620 &degC), which means that if Magcargo was the reported temperature, it would just sink into the Earth's core. Another explanation for Magcargo's high temperature is that its body retains the heat with a diminished transfer rate, preventing Magcargo from melting everything around it.</div>
