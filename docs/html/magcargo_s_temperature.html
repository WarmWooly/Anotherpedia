  <div><<shortThe temperature of the hottest Pokémonshort>><<img(src=git/hugging magcargo.jpg(cap=[[Powerscalers|Powerscaler]] are going insane right now.img>>{{b[[Magcargo's|magcargo]] [[temperature]]}}, as said in the [[Pokédex|Pokédex (Pokémon)]], is "roughly" 18,000 &deg[[F|Fahrenheit]] (~10,000 &deg[[C|Celsius]]),<<ref(content=link|https://www.facebook.com/PokemonUKGB/videos/magcargos-body-temperature-is-roughly-18000-degrees-fahrenheit-flames-burst-from/445447090768641/(text=refCountref>> making it the hottest [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] alongside [[Camerupt]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/turn-up-the-heat-with-the-highest-temperature-pokemon?_gl=1*1tfmdlw*_ga*MTI1NTU0MjUxMC4xNzM1MTI3NjUw*_ga_V0JTVBC6Y3*MTczNTEyNzY1MC4xLjAuMTczNTEyNzY1MC4wLjAuMA..(text=refCountref>> While its body is made of [[magma]], its temperature far exceeds the normal 2,700 &degF (1,500 &degC) of magma,<<ref(content=link|https://www.usgs.gov/news/volcano-watch-magma-whats-hot-and-whats-not(text=refCountref>> often compared with the heat of the [[Sun]]'s [[surface|photosphere]] at 10,000 &degF (5,500 &degC).<<ref(content=link|https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/temperatures-across-our-solar-system/#h-sun(text=refCountref>> An explanation for Magcargo's reported temperature is that the Pokédex is erroneous, as seen by comparing the environmental effects of Magcargo versus the actual outcome of a 120 [[pound]] mass of 18,000 &degF on the environment.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvkVGzwUA0(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://screenrant.com/pokemon-game-series-magcargo-pokedex-entry-fake/(text=refCountref>> This can be backed up with how Magcargo's temperature exceeds that of the [[vaporization]] temperatures of common rock types that make up the [[Earth's crust]] (ex. [[limestone]] vaporizes between 6080 &degF and 6550 &degF or 3360 &degC and 3620 &degC),<<ref(content=link|https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Estimated-Energy-to-Vaporize-Rocks_tbl1_279809817(text=refCountref>> which means that if Magcargo was the reported temperature, it would just sink into the [[Earth's core|Earth's inner core]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k6dwYRIMPc(text=refCountref>> Another explanation for Magcargo's high temperature is that its body retains the heat with a diminished [[transfer rate|heat transfer rate]], preventing Magcargo from melting everything around it.<<ref(content=link|https://www.tumblr.com/scientificpokedex/153029342064/i-hope-you-dont-mind-me-asking-but-if-magcargos(text=refCountref>></div>
