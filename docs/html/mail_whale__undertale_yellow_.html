      <div><<shortMail carrier and fast travel NPC in {{iUndertale Yellow}}short>>{{tThis page contains [[spoilers|spoiler]] for the [[game|video game]] {{ai[[Undertale Yellow]]}}.}}&sp<<img(src=git/mail whale undertale yellow.gif(cap=Mail Whale holding Clover in a basket.img>>{{bMail Whale}} is an [[NPC|Non-playable character]] in {{i[[Undertale Yellow]]}} that appears in [[Snowdin|Snowdin (Undertale Yellow)]] when introducing the [[UGPS|UGPS (Undertale Yellow)]] mechanic to the player. Mail Whale works for UGPS, carrying [[mail|mail (Undertale Yellow)]], and later in the game, [[Clover|Clover (Undertale Yellow)]] (the [[player character]]) around to the [[UGPS stations|UGPS station (Undertale Yellow)]] dotted throughout the game.<<hrAppearance and naminghr>>As his name suggests, Mail Whale looks like a [[whale]] with wings and a cap. Mail Whale's body is pink with a white underbelly and pink stripes. He has a large mouth, two eyes that are always closed, and two flippers. His tail is a [[fluke]] splitting into two. He also has two white wings on his upper back segmented into three parts and a blue cap with a gold stripe, a black bottom, and extending white details. He carries a [[mail bag]] around holding mail on his tail, flying in a crescent shape. The mail bag can be swapped out for a [[basket]] to hold Clover.&pMail Whale got its name during development because {{imail}} and {{iwhale}} rhymed.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/UndertaleYellow/status/1871571938314989606(text=refCountref>> This rhyming theme would stick with Mail Whale, where he would rhyme when talking to the player and in the mail they sent (besides in the [[Wild East Saloon|Wild East Saloon (Undertale Yellow)]]).<<hrPlot involvementhr>>Mail Whale is first introduced at a UGPS station in Snowdin, descending from the sky to greet Clover and hand them an introductory piece of mail. When Clover reaches the [[Sunnyside Farm|Sunnyside Farm (Undertale Yellow)]], Mail Whale tells Clover that they can use the UGPS stations as [[fast travel]] points. During the [[Neutral Route|Neutral Route (Undertale Yellow)]], Mail Whale will appear in the [[Steamworks|Steamworks (Undertale Yellow)]] (or [[the Furnace|The Furnace (Undertale Yellow)]] when aborting a Pacifist/Genocide Route) with priority mail from [[Martlet|Martlet (Undertale Yellow)]]. During a [[Genocide Route|Genocide Route (Undertale Yellow)]], Mail Whale will not come to UGPS stations when called after the first introduction.<<hrDialoguehr>>{{tThanks ceruleanwarbler2 for uploading a repository of all dialogue from {{aiUndertale Yellow}} <<link(src=https://ceruleanwarbler2.neocities.org/dialogue/(text=herelink>>!}}<<hr2First encounterhr2>><<code* Oh boy, oh gee, a customer!&sp* I'm nervous!&p* I'm a Mail Whale from the Underground Postal Service!&p* Haven't heard of us?
