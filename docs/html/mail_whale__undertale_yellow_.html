      <h1>Mail Whale (Undertale Yellow)</h1>
      <div>This page contains spoilers for the game aiUndertale Yellow.&spMail Whale is an NPC in Undertale Yellow that appears in Snowdin when introducing the UGPS mechanic to the player. Mail Whale works for UGPS, carrying mail, and later in the game, Clover (the player character) around to the UGPS stations dotted throughout the game.

As his name suggests, Mail Whale looks like a whale with wings and a cap. Mail Whale's body is pink with a white underbelly and pink stripes. He has a large mouth, two eyes that are always closed, and two flippers. His tail is a fluke splitting into two. He also has two white wings on his upper back segmented into three parts and a blue cap with a gold stripe, a black bottom, and extending white details. He carries a mail bag around holding mail on his tail, flying in a crescent shape. The mail bag can be swapped out for a basket to hold Clover.&pMail Whale got its name during development because mail and whale rhymed.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/UndertaleYellow/status/1871571938314989606(text=refCountref>> This rhyming theme would stick with Mail Whale, where he would rhyme when talking to the player and in the mail they sent (besides in the Wild East Saloon).

Mail Whale is first introduced at a UGPS station in Snowdin, descending from the sky to greet Clover and hand them an introductory piece of mail. When Clover reaches the Sunnyside Farm, Mail Whale tells Clover that they can use the UGPS stations as fast travel points. During the Neutral Route, Mail Whale will appear in the Steamworks (or the Furnace when aborting a Pacifist/Genocide Route) with priority mail from Martlet. During a Genocide Route, Mail Whale will not come to UGPS stations when called after the first introduction.
