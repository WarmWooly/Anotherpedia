  <h1>Mail Whale (Undertale Yellow)</h1>
  <div>This page contains spoiler for the video game {{aiUndertale Yellow.}}&spMail Whale is an Non-playable character in Undertale Yellow that appears in Snowdin (Undertale Yellow) when introducing the UGPS (Undertale Yellow) mechanic to the player. Mail Whale works for UGPS, carrying mail (Undertale Yellow), and later in the game, Clover (Undertale Yellow) (the player character) around to the UGPS station (Undertale Yellow) dotted throughout the game.
As his name suggests, Mail Whale looks like a whale with wings and a cap. Mail Whale's body is pink with a white underbelly and pink stripes. He has a large mouth, two eyes that are always closed, and two flippers. His tail is a fluke splitting into two. He also has two white wings on his upper back segmented into three parts and a blue cap with a gold stripe, a black bottom, and extending white details. He carries a mail bag around holding mail on his tail, flying in a crescent shape. The mail bag can be swapped out for a basket to hold Clover.&pMail Whale got its name during development because mail and whale rhymed.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/UndertaleYellow/status/1871571938314989606(text=refCountref>> This rhyming theme would stick with Mail Whale, where he would rhyme when talking to the player and in the mail they sent (besides in the Wild East Saloon (Undertale Yellow)).
Mail Whale is first introduced at a UGPS station in Snowdin, descending from the sky to greet Clover and hand them an introductory piece of mail. When Clover reaches the Sunnyside Farm (Undertale Yellow), Mail Whale tells Clover that they can use the UGPS stations as fast travel points. During the Neutral Route (Undertale Yellow), Mail Whale will appear in the Steamworks (Undertale Yellow) (or The Furnace (Undertale Yellow) when aborting a Pacifist/Genocide Route) with priority mail from Martlet (Undertale Yellow). During a Genocide Route (Undertale Yellow), Mail Whale will not come to UGPS stations when called after the first introduction.
