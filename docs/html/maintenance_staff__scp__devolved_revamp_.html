      <h1>Maintenance Staff (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Maintenance Staff (MS) is a role (SCP: Devolved Revamp) within SCP: Devolved Revamp who can refuel the generator when it is under 100%. MS members should focus on refueling the generator when it gets low so the power does not go out. 

The MS has 5 levels, with each giving a new title. At levels 3 and 5, their keycards (SCP: Devolved Revamp) access also increases.<<table |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Level 4|Level 5||Title|"Apprentice"|"Custodian"|"Technician"|"Supervisor"|"Chief Engineer"||Keycard|Keycard Level 1 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|Level 1|Keycard Level 2 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|Level 2|Keycard Level 3 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)table>>

MSs spawn in a room labeled "Maintenance Team" in Sector 1 of the map (SCP: Devolved Revamp). The room requires a Level 1 Keycard to enter. The back wall of the room has a couch with two plants, one on each side of the couch, and to the left wall there are file cabinets, a counter, and a corkboard with various papers thumb tacked to it. A few papers and a mug of coffee sit on the counter, and on the right wall, a clock can be seen as well as a two-person table and a water dispensing machine. On the wall a quote from Walt Loccman is written saying "Make sure that from here on, you start appreciating the hard work that people do.", two LED panel light up the room, and at the front of the room the Maintenance Staff uniform can be seen as well as a TV with the following information:For Maintenance Team:<br>- MAINTAIN THE GENERATOR<br>- clean the facility<br>- fix unscrewed vents<br>- run away from dangerous things<br>- follow orders from administration</div>
