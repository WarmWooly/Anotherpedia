      <h1>Make America Great Again</h1>
      <div>For Ronald Reagan political slogan in 1980 United States presidential election, see Let's make America great again.<br>Make America Great Again, abbreviated as MAGA, is an American political slogan which was popularization by Donald Trump during the 2016 United States presidential election, which he reused in the 2020 United States presidential election and 2024 United States presidential election. It follows Donald Trump's goal to improve America. It has since been associated with those on the far right who follow Donald Trump's political view. This primarily includes Prevention of foreign influence and immigration into the United States, such as United States immigration from Mexico and Muslim immigration to the United States. It takes a similar form to another political slogan used by Trump, Fake News (political slogan), which was used to Right-wing attempts to disenfranchise media in the United States from popular outlets against MAGA.</div>
