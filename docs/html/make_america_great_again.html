      <h1>Make America Great Again</h1>
      <div>For Ronald Reagan's political slogan in 1980, see Let's make America great again.&spMake America Great Again, abbreviated as MAGA, is an American political slogan which was popularized by Donald Trump during the 2016 election, which he reused in the 2020 and 2024 elections. It follows Donald Trump's goal to improve America. It has since been associated with those on the far right who follow Donald Trump's political views. This primarily includes blocking foreign influence, such as immigration from Mexico and Muslim nations. It takes a similar form to another political slogan used by Trump, Fake News, which was used to disenfranchise the media from popular outlets against MAGA.</div>
