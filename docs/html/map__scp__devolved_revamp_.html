  <h1>Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
  <div>The {{bmap}} in {{i[[SCP: Devolved Revamp]]}}, also known as SCP Site 387, is smaller than the original {{i[[SCP: Devolved Classic]]}} map, but is much more organized and straightforward. The new map is split into four main sections: outside of the facility, Sector 1, Sector 2, and Sector 3, with Sector 4 coming at a later date.<<hrMap layouthr>><<hr2Sector 1hr2>><<img(src=git/sector 1 scpdr.png(cap=Halls in Sector 1.img>>Sector 1 contains mainly of the site facility staff rooms and staff facilities such as the paramedics, maintenance room, and administrative branch. It also contains the staff cafeteria and the two office spaces, Office 1 and Office 2. The [[control room|control room (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], which controls the alarm system across the facility, alongside the generator room, which keeps power to the site.&pSector 1 has a pretty simple layout. When you enter from outside the facility, straight ahead at the end of the hall will be the control room, and when going there on the left-hand side will be the 2 office rooms, and if you keep going left, the generator room and maintenance staff are to the left. Just before the control room door on the left side of the same wall, the administrative branch is also located there. Back at the entrance of Sector 1, forward but on the right side will be the staff cafeteria, paramedics and medbay, and the Sector 2 gate.<<hr2Sector 2hr2>><<img(src=git/sector 2 scpdr.png(cap=The viewing area in Sector 2.img>>Sector 2 contains more combative and research staff rooms, such as security and research teams and the [[armory|armory (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], as well as the [[Class D containment room|Class D containment room (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], a stairwell to the lower level, and Sector 1 and 3 Gates. Sector 2 is also home to 3 SCPs: [[SCP-066|SCP-066 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-513|SCP-513 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-999|SCP-999 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], and [[SCP-???|SCP-??? (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]].&pSector 2's layout is a bit more complex than Sector 1's. When you walk in, you will be in the viewing room with the research department on the left, the stairwell straight ahead, and 2 doors to the Class D cells on the right. At the end of the stairwell, on the front wall facing after exiting it, the SCP-066 and SCP-999 rooms can be seen. Going to the left and down that hallway contains the site security room, and taking another left turn, there will be SCP-??? and the armory on the right with Sector 3 gate on the left. Taking one more left turn on the right side wall will be two big gates, both leading to the Class D containment room.<<hr2Sector 3hr2>><<img(src=git/sector 3 scpdr.png(cap=The main hall in Sector 3.img>>Sector 3's main purpose is to hold [[Keter|Keter (SCP Foundation)]] and [[Euclid|Euclid (SCP Foundation)]] SCPs and it is home to the most deadly SCPs in Site 387. The following 7 SCPs are found in Sector 3: [[SCP-035|SCP-035 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-049|SCP-049 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-096|SCP-096 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-173|SCP-173 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-409|SCP-409 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[SCP-457|SCP-457 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], and [[SCP-682|SCP-682 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]. Sector 3 has a small passage room as well as the gate back to Sector 2 and the gate to Sector 4.&pSector 3's layout is very simple, entering from Sector 2 with a downward ramp. At the bottom, there is another Sector 3 gate and a small double-doored passageway on the right. The first set of SCPs are SCP-096 and SCP-682, right as you pass that gate. To the right lay SCP-409 and SCP-173, with SCP-049, SCP-035, and SCP-457 on the left. At the back of Sector 3 is the Sector 4 gate, which cannot be entered <<asofNovember 2025>>.<<hr2Outsidehr2>><<img(src=git/outside scpdr.png(cap=Outside the facility.img>>There isn't much located outside the facility, but these few places play a huge role in the game. The [[Chaos Insurgency camp|Chaos Insurgency camp (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]] and the Mobile Task Force helicopter pad and cave are located outside the facility alongside the entrance to the facility and Sector 1, and a huge gate designed to keep Chaos Insurgency outside the facility property.&pThe outside of the facility has a pretty basic layout. Exiting the facility to the left with be the cave that leads to the Mobile Task Force helipad/spawn. Straight ahead will be the passage room from the facility property to the complete outside of the facility, as well as the huge facility gate. Beyond the gate will be a forest, and through it is a bridge and a river. Once crossing that, there will be a path that leads to the Chaos Insurgency camp.<<hr2Sector 4hr2>><<img(src=git/sector 4 gate scpdr.png(cap=Sector 4's gate.img>>Sector 4's gate is in the game, located at the end of Sector 3. It currently has an invisible wall right before its tiny hallway to get to the gate, making the key card requirement unknown, and from information in the official {{iSCP: Devolved Revamp }}[[Discord|Discord (application)]] server, there is no official release date or confirmation of Sector 4 being added as a playable area in the game.</div>
