      <h1>Mareep</h1>
      <div>Mareep is a sheep-like Electric type Pokémon from the second generation.
Mareep resembles sheep in form, having a blue body covered in off-white wool, a head, four legs, and a tail. The wool extends up to its head, making a large curl at the top. Its head consists of a mouth, flush nostrils, a pair of brown eyes, and a pair of yellow conical horns with two black stripes on each. Its short legs extend downward from the body with two toes at the end. The tail is comparatively long, extending from the back and curving upwards, and is yellow with two black stripes. The end of the tail connects to a yellowish-orange bulb.&pMareep's official size is 2 ft, while weighing 17.2 lbs. Shiny Mareeps have pink wool instead of off-white.&pMareep's name is an anagram of ampere, a unit for electric current.
Mareep's wool coat slowly builds up static electricity when it rubs together, puffing it up to double its size and causing its tail bulb to glow. Its wool is also full of air, keeping it cool during the summer or warm in the winter. Mareep sheds its fleece during the summer, growing back by the next week. Mareep's wool will shock people when touched without adequate protection. Because of this, a special process is required to make clothing with its fleece.
A Mareep has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Mareep is the 179th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color white.&pMareep evolves into Flaaffy at level 15, and at level 30, Ampharos. Mareep's leveling rate is "Medium Slow".</div>
