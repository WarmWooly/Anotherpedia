      <h1>Marius (floriane_clabri)</h1>
      <div>Marius is an original character drawn by floriane_clabri and posted on Instagram on December 13, 2018 for the #drawthisinyourstyle challenge and as a character for floriane's personal project.<<ref(content=link|https://www.instagram.com/p/BrVYt0Jh06n/(text=refCountref>> The post garnered over one thousand likes and multiple positive comments. Her older brother, marinevhs, participated with his own rendition of Marius four days later.
The post itself did not mention any personality or describe any character traits outright, but based on the image, Marius would likely be a younger child, as he wears a stuffed bear on his back. He also had a thick blue hoody with a black and white stripped inside, short blonde hair, and a pair of stylized glasses (left lens red, right lens blue).</div>
