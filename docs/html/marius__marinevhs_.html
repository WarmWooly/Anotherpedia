American or U.S. citizen would better fit Matthew's nationality.(text=noteCountnote>>||Ethnicity|African American||Height|5ft 7in.||Weight|77lbs||Hair color|Dirty blonde||Hair length|Short||Eye color|Dark brown||Skin tone|Tantable>>&spThe description for Matthew considers him sociable and funny. This is seen in the "lines" he would say based on his situation. He is addicted to social media, is agile, strong, and stealthy, and was sucked into the "Entitys Realm" as described in his backstory. The description has multiple uses of owo and variations of such throughout alongside many grammatical errors such as how the backstory also mentions he was a "Long Fistance Away From His House."</div>
