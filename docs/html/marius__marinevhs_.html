In the Amino for Dead by Daylight, Marius (named "Matthew Eugene McLaughlin") is used as an original character for a zombie survivor. The following table has all described basic traits of Matthew in the Amino post:<<tableName|Matthew Eugene McLaughlin||Nickname|Eugene, Matt, McLaughlin||Gender|Male||Sexuality|Straight (sexuality)||Birthdate|3/18/2004||Astrological sign|Aries (astrology)||Nationality|New York City||Ethnicity|African American||Human height|5foot (unit) 7inch||Human weight|77pound||Hair color|Dirty blonde||Hair length|Short hairstyle||Eye color|Dark brown||Skin tone|Tantable>><br>The character description for Matthew considers him sociable and funny. This is seen in the "lines" he would say based on his situation. He is social media addiction to social media, is agile, strong, and stealthy, and was sucked into the "Entitys Realm" as described in his backstory. The description has multiple uses of owo and variations of such throughout alongside many grammatical error such as how the backstory also mentions he was a "Long Fistance Away From His House."</div>
