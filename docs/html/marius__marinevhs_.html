Main page: Turtle (RGL.gg member)<br>On the website for the Team Fortress 2 league, RGL.gg, there is a user with the name "Turtle" who uses Marius as their profile picture. Their SteamId is 76561198289262787.

In the Amino for Dead by Daylight, Marius (named "Matthew Eugene McLaughlin") is used as an original character for a survivor. The following table has all described basic traits of Matthew in the Amino post:<<tableName|Matthew Eugene McLaughlin||Nicknames|Eugene, Matt, McLaughlin||Gender|Male||Sexuality|Straight||Birthdate|3/18/2004||Astrological sign|Aries||Nationality|New York City||Ethnicity|African American||Height|5ft 7in.||Weight|77lbs||Hair color|Dirty blonde||Hair length|Short||Eye color|Dark brown||Skin tone|Tantable>><br>The description for Matthew considers him sociable and funny. This is seen in the "lines" he would say based on his situation. He is addicted to social media, is agile, strong, and stealthy, and was sucked into the "Entitys Realm" as described in his backstory. The description has multiple uses of owo and variations of such throughout alongside many grammatical errors such as how the backstory also mentions he was a "Long Fistance Away From His House."</div>
