He is [[agile]], a [[conversationalist]] when [[comfortable|personal comfort]], [[friendly]], and easy to [[manipulate]]. Based on Mark's [[backstory]], he has been pressed into committing [[theft]] and [[assault and battery]]. While in a [[dungeon]], he was trapped by a [[rock]] before being [[rescued|cave rescue]] by Persephone. They became [[friends|friend]], both joining the Weasel Guild.&pMark has the [[nicknames|nickname]] Martini (a combination of {{iMark}} and {{iDratini}}, sharing the name with the [[cocktail]] {{i[[martini]]}}), Noodle (based on the [[noodle]]-esque shape of Dratini and Mark's love of noodles), and Kid. He enjoys noodles, but not martinis.<<note(content=Mark, being 17, would not be permitted to consume an [[alcoholic beverage]] based on the [[legal drinking age]] in most countries. Depending on the circumstance, this could constitute [[underage drinking]].(text=noteCountnote>><<hrAppearanceshr>><<hr2Mystics of Naturehr2>>{{tMain page: [[Dungeon Chasers: Mystics of Nature (Bokureii)]]}}&spIn the short story "Mystics of Nature" posted to DeviantART between August 13 and 15, 2019, it focuses on Mark and Persephone going through a [[forest]]-shaped dungeon looking for [[treasure]] as described by their guild master.<<ref(content=link|https://www.deviantart.com/bokureii/art/D-C-Dungeon-1-Mystics-of-Nature-Part-1-809535248(text=refCountref>> Mark is shown as nervous in part 1, especially with the added confusion that there is supposedly a set of stairs and floors to a forest. His [[emotions|emotion]] are shown to be in stark contrast to Persephone, who is calm and collected. In part 2, Persephone and Mark encounter a [[Caterpie]], where Mark panics and whips it to the dismay and surprise of Persephone. When they find the treasure in part 3, Mark fears that the chest set up by their guild master may be trapped.<<note(content=His reasoning for fearing that the treasure chest is trapped is that the guild master is a [[dark type|Dark type (Pokémon)]].(text=noteCountnote>> The pair take the treasure as the story concludes.<<hr2{{iPokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island}}hr2>>{{tMain page: {{ai[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island]]}}}}&sp{{iPokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island}} primarily focuses on Persephone, who washed up onto Mystic Island. In chapter 1, page 14, Mark is only thought about by Persephone, acting as a motivation for her to try and get back to her teammate as she fears that Mark could be endangered while she's stuck on an island.<<ref(content=link|https://www.deviantart.com/bokureii/art/PMD-MI-Chapter-1-Page-14-868654804(text=refCountref>> Mark is then thought about again by the [[protagonist]] in chapter 2, page 44, leaving a [[cliffhanger]] for what could be happening back on the mainland and as extra character motivation.<<ref(content=link|https://www.deviantart.com/bokureii/art/PMD-MI-Chapter-2-Page-44-954727544(text=refCountref>> {{iPokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island}} is left unfinished and is not planned to be continued by Bokureii.</div>
