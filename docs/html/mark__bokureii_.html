      <h1>Mark (Bokureii)</h1>
      <div>For the Meowth by Bokurei the Phantump, see Mark (Bokurei the Phantump).<br>Mark, fully known as Mark the Dratini, is an original character of the Pokémon (fictional species) Dratini drawn by Bokureii that was posted to DevientART, Twitter, and Fur Affinity. As stated by Bokureii, Mark has been a character he's had since 2015. Mark was used for roleplay related to the spin-off Pokémon series Pokémon Mystery Dungeon known as DUNGEON-CHASER (Pokémon RP) and as a character for a project by Bokureii related to the fan-made Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Comics series.

Mark closely resembles a Dratini, with the only variations including a birthmark, red eyes, freckle, and an elongated horn resembling that of a Dragonair. Mark wears a green bandana as his attire. Mark is 17 year old, has the Ability (Pokémon) Shed Skin (Pokémon), and the move (Pokémon) Thunder Wave (Pokémon), Extreme Speed (Pokémon), Wrap (Pokémon), and Dragon Rage (Pokémon). His team's name is "Noodles," being with a Snivy named Persephone (Bokureii).<br><br>Mark is regarded as timid, especially with his stutter. He is agile, a conversationalist when personal comfort, friendly, and easy to manipulate. Based on Mark's backstory, he has been pressed into committing theft and assault and battery. While in a dungeon, he was trapped by a rock before being cave rescue by Persephone. They became friend, both joining the Weasel Guild.<br><br>Mark has the nickname Martini (a combination of Mark and Dratini, sharing the name with the cocktail martini), Noodle (based on the noodle-esque shape of Dratini and Mark's love of noodles), and Kid. He enjoys noodles, but not martinis.



Main page: Dungeon Chasers: Mystics of Nature (Bokureii)<br>In the short story "Mystics of Nature" posted to DeviantART between August 13 and 15, 2019, it focuses on Mark and Persephone going through a forest-shaped dungeon looking for treasure as described by their guild master. Mark is shown as nervous in part 1, especially with the added confusion that there is supposedly a set of stairs and floors to a forest. His emotion are shown to be in stark contrast to Persephone, who is calm and collected. In part 2, Persephone and Mark encounter a Caterpie, where Mark panics and whips it to the dismay and surprise of Persephone. When they find the treasure in part 3, Mark fears that the chest set up by their guild master may be trapped. The pair take the treasure as the story concludes.

Main page: {{aiPokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island}}<br>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island primarily focuses on Persephone, who washed up onto Mystic Island. In chapter 1, page 14, Mark is only thought about by Persephone, acting as a motivation for her to try and get back to her teammate as she fears that Mark could be endangered while she's stuck on an island. Mark is then thought about again by the protagonist in chapter 2, page 44, leaving a cliffhanger for what could be happening back on the mainland and as extra character motivation. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Mystic Island is left unfinished and is not planned to be continued by Bokureii.</div>
