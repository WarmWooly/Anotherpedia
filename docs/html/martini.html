  <h1>Martini</h1>
  <div>A {{bmartini}} is a cocktail of gin and vermouth with a whole olive or a twist (cocktail garnish). Martinis are served cold, but not given ice, and in a cocktail glass. A {{bdry martini}} is a martini with less vermouth, while a {{bkangaroo}} (also called a {{bvodka martini}}) is a martini served with vodka instead of gin. The martini is considered "unforgettable" by the International Bartenders Association (Abbreviation). The IBA's official guidelines have a martini comprised of 60 mililiter of gin and 10 mL of vermouth (a 6:1 ratio). A martini should be prepared in a mixing glass with ice, and then stirring when being served.</div>
