  <h1>Martini</h1>
  <div><<shortGin and vermouth cocktailshort>><<img(src=git/martini.jpg(cap=A gin-based martini with an olive.img>>A {{bmartini}} is a [[cocktail]] of [[gin]] and [[vermouth]] with a whole [[olive]] or a [[lemon twist|twist (cocktail garnish)]]. Martinis are served cold, but not given [[ice]], and in a [[cocktail glass]]. A {{bdry martini}} is a martini with less vermouth, while a {{bkangaroo}} (also called a {{bvodka martini}}) is a martini served with [[vodka]] instead of gin. The martini is considered "unforgettable" by the [[International Bartenders Association]] ([[IBA|Abbreviation]]). The IBA's official guidelines have a martini comprised of 60 [[mL|mililiter]] of gin and 10 mL of vermouth (a 6:1 [[ratio]]). A martini should be prepared in a [[mixing glass]] with [[ice]], and then [[stirred|stirring]] when being served.</div>
