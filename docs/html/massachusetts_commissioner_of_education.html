This is conflated with the name changes, the period of time when DESE was under the [[Executive Office of Education]], and the numerous changes to the [[Massachusetts Board of Education]]. Many sources do not explicitly list DESE or the Massachusetts Department of Education, with some having multiple positions simultaneously. It can be noted that an acting commissioner is not considered a commissioner.comment>></div>
