      <h1>Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education</h1>
      <div>The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, abbreviated to DESE, is a state agency in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts inside the United States of America. DESE manages education from kindergarten to high school, including standards, licences, policies, and educational improvements.
The Massachusetts Board of Education was established in 1837. The Massachusetts Department of Education (DoE) was then formed in 1919, which took the powers of the Board of Education and the Bureau of Immigration (now known as ORI), which also oversaw other agencies.&pThe newly formed department had a commissioner and an Advisory Board of Education comprised of six people, all appointed by the governor. In 1947, the advisory board was replaced by the Massachusetts Board of Education (distinct from the one formed in 1837). This board consisted of nine gubernatorial appointees who were appointed by the commissioner. <<AsofMarch 2024>>, the board has twelve members.&pFrom 1971 to 1980, the DoE was run under the Executive Office of Education.&pIn 1999, the Massachusetts Department of Education changed its name to the now-known Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.&p<<AsofAugust 2025>>, the current commissioner for DESE is Pedro Martinez.</div>
