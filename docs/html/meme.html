      <h1>Meme</h1>
      <div>For the form specifically spread over the internet, see internet meme.<br>A meme is information with cultural importance that is spread to other people. Memes are seen as a unit of a culture, symbolizing a singular piece of the culture that is deemed of enough importance to warrant the continued existence of the idea. Memes can be spread using a myriad of mediums, such as chatrooms, messaging apps, television, streaming, and even word of mouth. The study of memes is known as memetics. Many view memes as a sort of lifeform, like a virus on the mind, which must either adapt to survive or go extinct after loosing relevance. The modern usage of meme is said to have originated from Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book titled The Selfish Gene.

There is often confusion between a meme and an internet meme. The main difference is the transportation and imitation. A meme is solely a part of a culture that can be spread to others, which grows in popularity over time if it is considered a high enough value. An internet meme, however, is a form of media made to be spread over the internet, often in the form of videos or images, which may represent a part of a culture.</div>
