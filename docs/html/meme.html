  <h1>Meme</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the form specifically spread over the internet, see internet meme.}}&spA {{bmeme}} is information with popular culture that is spread of information to other people. Memes are seen as a unit of a culture, symbolizing a singular piece of the culture that is deemed of enough importance to warrant the continued existence of the idea. Memes can be spread using a myriad of mediums, such as chatroom, messaging application, television, streaming, and even oral communication. The scientific study of memes is known as memetics. Many view memes as a sort of lifeform, like a virus on the mind, which must either adaptation to survival or go extinct after loosing relevance. The modern usage of {{imeme}} is said to have origin from Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book titled {{iThe Selfish Gene}}.
There is often confusion between a meme and an internet meme. The main difference is the transportation and imitation. A meme is solely a part of a culture that can be spread to others, which grows in popularity over time if it is considered a high enough value. An internet meme, however, is a form of media made to be spread over the internet, often in the form of video or image, which may represent a part of a culture.</div>
