      <h1>Methylamine</h1>
      <div><<nodanger>>Methylamine is an organic chemical used in several medicinal and industrial applications, alongside the creation of methamphetamine. It is often in the form of a gas, being chemically similar to ammonia. It is stored either as a gas or a liquid mixed in a solution alongside ethanol, water, or other compounds. Methylamine is highly flammable, can irritate the eyes and skin, alongside being harmful to inhale. Methylamine's chemical formula is CHs-b3NHs-b2, which can be shortened to CHs-b5N. It boils at 20.66 °F.&p
One of methylamine's most well-known aspects is the synthesis of methamphetamine, both starting with meth. In the United States, it is on the DEA's list as a List 1 precursor because of this. It is used in the production of methamphetamine by using reductive amination with phenylacetone. It is also made as a byproduct using a Leuckart reaction, which is then used later in the process.
This section contains spoilers for the show {{aiBreaking Bad.}}&spThe most notable usage of methylamine was in the series Breaking Bad, where several key plot points are based around obtaining methylamine to cook meth. This includes stealing a barrel due to a lack of pseudo and robbing a train with a tank full of methylamine.</div>
