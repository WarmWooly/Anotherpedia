      <h1>Methylamine</h1>
      <div><<shortOrganic chemical used in methamphetamineshort>><<nodanger>><<img(src=git/methylamine.png(cap=A [[diagram]] of the structure of methylamine.img>>{{bMethylamine}} is an [[organic]] [[chemical]] used in several [[medicinal]] and [[industrial]] applications, alongside the [[creation]] of [[methamphetamine]]. It is often in the form of a [[gas]], being chemically similar to [[ammonia]]. It is stored either as a gas or a [[liquid]] mixed in a [[solution]] alongside [[ethanol]], [[water]], or other [[compounds|compound]]. Methylamine is highly [[flammable]], can [[irritate|irritation]] the [[eyes|eye]] and [[skin]], alongside being harmful to [[inhale|inhalation]]. Methylamine's [[chemical formula]] is [[C|Carbon]][[H|Hydrogen]]{{s-b3}}[[N|Nitrogen]]H{{s-b2}}, which can be shortened to CH{{s-b5}}N. It [[boils|boiling]] at 20.66 °[[F|Fahrenheit]].&p<<hrRegulation and drug productionhr>>One of methylamine's most well-known aspects is the synthesis of methamphetamine, both starting with {{imeth}}. In the [[United States]], it is on the [[DEA's|Drug Enforcement Agency]] [[list|List of Chemicals Classified by the DEA]] as a List 1 [[precursor|precursor (chemistry)]] because of this. It is used in the production of methamphetamine by using [[reductive amination]] with [[phenylacetone]]. It is also made as a [[byproduct|byproduct (chemistry)]] using a [[Leuckart reaction]], which is then used later in the [[process]].<<img(src=git/meth production.png(cap=A reductive amination used to make methamphetamine with methylamine and phenylacetone.(brightImg(spanImgimg>><<hrPopular culturehr>>{{tThis section contains spoilers for the show [[{{aiBreaking Bad}}]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/meth carry.gif(cap=[[Walter|Walter White (Breaking Bad)]] and [[Jesse|Jesse Pinkman (Breaking Bad)]] [[carrying]] away a barrel of methylamine.img>>The most notable usage of methylamine was in the [[series]] {{iBreaking Bad}}, where several key [[plot points|plot point]] are based around obtaining methylamine to cook meth. This includes [[stealing]] a [[barrel]] due to a lack of [[pseudo|pseudo (drug production)]] and [[robbing]] a [[train]] with a [[tank|tank train car]] full of methylamine.</div>
