      <h1>Mewing</h1>
      <div>Mewing is a facial workout to improve the jaw structure of the face used in the process of looksmaxxing. To mew, press the entirety of the tongue onto the roof of the mouth for 20-30 minutes at a time. Pressing the lips tightly together may also aid in the process. There is little proof of mewing being effective. If someone attempts to converse with a person mewing, they will do the mewing shh to show that they can't talk at the moment.</div>
