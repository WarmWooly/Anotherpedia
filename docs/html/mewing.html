  <h1>Mewing</h1>
  <div><<shortWorkout for looksmaxxingshort>><<img(src=git/mewing.jpg(cap=A [[before and after]] of mewing.img>>{{bMewing}} is a [[facial workout]] to improve the [[jaw structure]] of the [[face]] used in the process of [[looksmaxxing]]. To mew, press the entirety of the [[tongue]] onto the roof of the [[mouth]] for 20-30 minutes at a time. Pressing the [[lips]] tightly together may also aid in the process. There is little [[proof]] of mewing being effective. If someone attempts to [[converse]] with a person mewing, they will do the [[mewing shh]] to show that they can't talk at the moment.</div>
