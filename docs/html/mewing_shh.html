      <h1>Mewing shh</h1>
      <div>The mewing shh is a gesture to communicate to others about your mewing. Because mewing requires the tongue to be pressed to the roof of the mouth, the person mewing will be unable to speak. To avoid looking awkward, they use this gesture to show that they are in the middle of a mewing session. They first press their index finger against their lips multiple times before slowly doing a single stroke down their jawline to their chin.</div>
