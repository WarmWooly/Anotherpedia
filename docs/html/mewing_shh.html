      <div><<shortGesture to show others that you're mewingshort>><<img(src=git/mewing shh.gif(cap=A man doing the mewing shh.img>>The {{bmewing shh}} is a [[gesture]] to [[communicate]] to others about your [[mewing]]. Because mewing requires the [[tongue]] to be pressed to the roof of the [[mouth]], the person mewing will be unable to [[speak]]. To avoid looking [[awkward]], they use this gesture to show that they are in the middle of a mewing session. They first press their [[index finger]] against their [[lips]] multiple times before slowly doing a single stroke down their [[jawline]] to their [[chin]].</div>
