  <h1>Mickey-shaped pumpkin</h1>
  <div>For the decorative pumpkin, see Mickey Mouse pumpkin.&spA Mickey-shaped pumpkin is a pumpkin that is grown in a fruit mold in the shape of Mickey Mouse head. This causes the pumpkin to have two lumps extrude upwards from the round body to fill the mold, creating "ears" on the pumpkin. Mickey-shaped pumpkins are produced in The Land (Epcot) pavilion at Epcot within Walt Disney World, which can be viewed during the Behind the Seeds Tour attraction.<<ref(content=link|https://inhabitat.com/mickey-mouse-sustainable-farming/(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://laughinglindsay.com/behind-the-seeds-tour-at-epcot-review/(text=refCountref>></div>
