      <h1>Microaggression</h1>
      <div>A microaggression is an insult, invalidation, or offensive behavior against a person. These are often conflated with actions that may be well-meaning in nature, but turn out to be harmful to an individual. The term originated in 1970 by Chester M. Pierce as seen toward African Americans, but it has since spread to include any slight against marginalized groups.</div>
