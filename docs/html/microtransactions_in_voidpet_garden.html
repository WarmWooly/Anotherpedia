      <h1>Microtransactions in Voidpet Garden</h1>
      <div>microtransaction in {{iVoidpet Garden}} are prevalent due to the free-to-play nature of the mobile application. The app has a premium currency, gems (Voidpet Garden), which are rarely earned through normal gameplay, and are used to buy higher-quality items (Voidpet Garden) and more storage for Voidpet (fictional species). A one-time starter pack (microtransaction) is also purchasable, giving large quantities of rare items and cosmetics (Voidpet Garden). Additionally, a subscription business model called "Voidpet GIGA" can be bought on a monthly or annual scale, giving more Voidpet storage, increased access to the journal (Voidpet Garden), more item drops, and an increased text (Voidpet Garden) limit.</div>
