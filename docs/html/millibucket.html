  <h1>Millibucket</h1>
  <div><<shortSemi-standard volume unit in {{iMinecraft}} moddingshort>><<img(src=git/millibucket.png(cap=A [[smeltery|smeltery (Tinkers' Construct)]] from {{iTinkers' Construct}} filled with various fluids: 90 mB of [[iron|molten iron (Tinkers' Construct)]], 810 mB of [[gold|molten gold (Tinkers' Construct)]], 1,000 mB of [[water|water (Minecraft)]], and 7,000 mB of [[obsidian|molten obsidian (Tinkers' Construct)]].img>>A {{bmillibucket}} ({{bmB}}) is a semi-standardized [[unit]] for measuring the [[volume]] of [[fluids|fluid]] and [[gasses|gas]] used within [[mods|mod (Minecraft)]] for {{i[[Minecraft]]}}. A [[bucket|bucket (Minecraft)]] (B) contains 1,000 mB. Generally, full [[blocks|block (Minecraft)]] are also 1,000 mB. Through mB, fluid quantities for smaller objects can be used in various recipes and operations, such as melting metals for molding, combining liquids together, or fueling machines. Other comparative units, such as ingots and potions, may also be used, but the item-to-bucket ratio changes between mods.&pPopular mods that utilize millibuckets include {{i[[Create|Create (Minecraft mod)]]}}, {{i[[Tinkers' Construct]]}}, {{i[[Mekanism]]}}, {{i[[Applied Energistics 2]]}}, {{i[[Refined Storage]]}}, and {{i[[Sophisticated Backpacks]]}}. Millibuckets are also used in measuring the storage space of a fluid container or the [[flow rate]] of a pipe or other fluid transportation device. The flow rate is usually measured in mB/[[sec|second]] or mB/[[tick|tick (Minecraft)]] (with a {{iMinecraft}} tick being 1/20th of a second).</div>
