  <h1>Millibucket</h1>
  <div>A millibucket (mB) is a semi-standardized unit for measuring the volume of fluid and gas used within mod (Minecraft) for Minecraft. A bucket (Minecraft) (B) contains 1,000 mB. Generally, full block (Minecraft) are also 1,000 mB. Through mB, fluid quantities for smaller objects can be used in various recipes and operations, such as melting metals for molding, combining liquids together, or fueling machines. Other comparative units, such as ingots and potions, may also be used, but the item-to-bucket ratio changes between mods.&pPopular mods that utilize millibuckets include Create (Minecraft mod), Tinkers' Construct, Mekanism, Applied Energistics 2, Refined Storage, and Sophisticated Backpacks. Millibuckets are also used in measuring the storage space of a fluid container or the flow rate of a pipe or other fluid transportation device. The flow rate is usually measured in mB/second or mB/tick (Minecraft) (with a Minecraft tick being 1/20th of a second).</div>
