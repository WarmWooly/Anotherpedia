It is the lowest tier of millstone.



A millstone can be crafted with 1 andesite slab, 1 granite slab, 2 smooth stone slabs, and 2 sticks (place the andesite in the center, the granite below, a stick above, the smooth stone in the bottom corners, and a stick in the top-left corner).



Millstones are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Powered Millstone - 1 millstone, 2 iron ingots, 2 redstone dust, and 1 redstone torch (place the millstone in the center, the torch below, an iron ingot above, the dust in the bottom corners, and an iron ingot in the top-left corner).

Main page: Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined)}}<br>To use the millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the main hand. Upon interacting with the millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. Manually milling will slowly deplete hunger. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. The millstone can be muted when placed on wool. With an open hand, the millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while sneaking.

A redstone comparator can read a millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the millstone is from its resting position. The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<tableState|Deg|Signal||0|r0&deg|r0||1|r45&deg|r3||2|r90&deg|r5||3|r135&deg|r7||4|r180&deg|r9||5|r225&deg|r11||6|r270&deg|r13||7|r315&deg|r15table>></div>
