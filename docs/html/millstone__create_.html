RPM}}|1 RPMinfo>>The {{bmillstone}} is a [[machine|machine (Create)]] in the {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[mod|mod (Minecraft)]] {{i[[Create|Create (Minecraft mod)]]}} used in milling items. It takes in [[rotational power|rotational power (Create)]] from connected [[cogwheels|cogwheel (Create)]] or [[shafts|shaft (Create)]].<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>A millstone can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]] with 1 [[cogwheel|cogwheel (Create)]], 1 [[andesite casing|andesite casing (Create)]], and 1 [[stone|stone (Minecraft)]]<<note(content="Stone" includes various stone-like blocks, including [[deepslate|deepslate (Minecraft)]], [[tuff|tuff (Minecraft)]], and [[granite|granite (Minecraft)]].(text=noteCountnote>> (place the casing in the center, the cogwheel above, and the stone below).<<hr3Automated shaped craftinghr3>>A millstone can be automatically crafted with 3 [[mechanical crafters|mechanical crafter (Create)]].<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Transferring rotational powerhr2>>A millstone can transfer [[rotational power|rotational power (Create)]] to adjacent interlocking cogwheels, [[shafts|shaft (Create)]], blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. [[mechanical arms|mechanical arm (Create)]]), or blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. [[water wheels|water wheel (Create)]]). When a millstone transfers rotational power to another cogwheel, the [[direction|rotation direction (Create)]] of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an [[encased fan|encased fan (Create)]] suck instead of blow) or change the direction of [[mechanical belts|mechanical belt (Create)]].&pIf the player is wearing [[engineer's goggles|engineer's goggles (Create)]], a particle effect will show the direction of the placed millstone. If a millstone goes above 256 RPM, is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel, or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.<<hr3Gearshiftinghr3>><<img(src=git/millstone gearshifting create.gif(cap=A large cogwheel gearshifting into a millstone.(leftImgimg>>When a millstone is diagonal to a [[large cogwheel|large cogwheel (Create)]], the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a millstone, the RPM will double, and if the millstone is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the [[stress|stress (Create)]] used.<<hr2Millinghr2>>[[Items|item (Minecraft entity)]] can enter a millstone through the top or be inserted with a [[hopper|hopper (Minecraft)]], [[chute|chute (Create)]], [[funnel|funnel (Create)]], [[mechanical arm|mechanical arm (Create)]], or other insertion method. Items can be removed from a millstone by right-clicking it, or automatically removed with a hopper, chute, funnel, mechanical arm, or other extraction method. When right-clicking a millstone, it will first remove all output items before removing input items.&pUp to a [[stack|stack size (Minecraft)]] of an input item and nine unique stacks of output items can be stored at a time. If the stack is full for an output item, input items will no longer get processed. If there are already nine unique output items stored in the millstone, additional items will be destroyed. Items that can't be milled can't be inserted into a millstone.&pThe time it takes to process items is based on two factors: the RPM of the millstone and the duration modifier of the item. Harder items like [[cobblestone|cobblestone (Minecraft)]] will take longer to process than [[cactus|cactus (Minecraft)]]. The length of the process is measured in [[ticks|tick (Minecraft)]] (1{{s-b/20th}} a [[second]]), with the formula {{code{{iticks}} = ⌈({{iduration}} / ({{iRPS}} / 16))⌉ + 1}}, where {{iticks}} must be between 1 to 512. In seconds, a process may take 0.05 to 25.6 seconds long. For example, at 16 RPM, it would take 101 ticks (5.05 seconds) to process a [[bone|bone (Minecraft)]].<<note(content={{code⌈(100 / (16 / 16)⌉ + 1 = ⌈100 / 1⌉ + 1 = 100 + 1 = 101

produced):<<table{{bInput}}|{{bOutputs}}|{{bDuration}}||[[Allium|Allium (Minecraft)]]|2 [[magenta dye|magenta dye (Minecraft)]]&sp1 [[pink dye|pink dye (Minecraft)]] (10%)&sp2 [[purple dye|purple dye
