      <h1>Millstone (Create)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|6||Hardness|1.5||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Waterloggable|Yes||{{bFlammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|No||SU/RPM|4 SU/1 RPM||{{bMin. RPM|1 RPMinfo>>The millstone is a machine in the Minecraft mod Create used in milling items. It takes in rotational power from connected cogwheels or shafts.



A millstone can be crafted with 1 cogwheel, 1 andesite casing, and 1 stone (place the casing in the center, the cogwheel above, and the stone below).

A millstone can be automatically crafted with 3 mechanical crafters.



A millstone can transfer rotational power to adjacent interlocking cogwheels, shafts, blocks with embedded cogwheels (i.e. mechanical arms), or blocks with embedded shafts (i.e. water wheels). When a millstone transfers rotational power to another cogwheel, the direction of the rotation is reversed. This can be used to alter the effects of machines (such as making an encased fan suck instead of blow) or change the direction of mechanical belts.<br><br>If the player is wearing engineer's goggles, a particle effect will show the direction of the placed millstone. If a millstone goes above 256 RPM, is placed going in the same direction as another cogwheel, or is placed going the opposite direction of a shaft, it will automatically break and drop.

When a millstone is diagonal to a large cogwheel, the RPM of the cogwheels gets halved/doubled. If a large cogwheel is powering a millstone, the RPM will double, and if the millstone is powering a large cogwheel, the RPM will halve. This gearshifting can be used to increase or decrease the RPM to increase the speed of machines or decrease the stress used.

Items can enter a millstone through the top or be inserted with a hopper, chute, funnel, mechanical arm, or other insertion method. Items can be removed from a millstone by right-clicking it, or automatically removed with a hopper, chute, funnel, mechanical arm, or other extraction method. When right-clicking a millstone, it will first remove all output items before removing input items.<br><br>Up to a stack of an input item and nine unique stacks of output items can be stored at a time. If the stack is full for an output item, input items will no longer get processed. If there are already nine unique output items stored in the millstone, additional items will be destroyed. Items that can't be milled can't be inserted into a millstone.<br><br>The time it takes to process items is based on two factors: the RPM of the millstone and the duration modifier of the item. Harder items like cobblestone will take longer to process than cactus. The length of the process is measured in ticks (1s-b/20th a second), with the formula code{{iticks = ⌈(duration / (RPS / 16))⌉ + 1}}, where ticks must be between 1 to 512. In seconds, a process may take 0.05 to 25.6 seconds long. For example, at 16 RPM, it would take 101 ticks (5.05 seconds) to process a bone.<br><br>These are the recipes that the millstone can be used to perform (outputs with % only have a percent chance of being produced):<<tableInput|Outputs|Duration||Allium|2 magenta dye<br>1 pink dye (10%)<br>2 purple dye (10%)|r50||Andesite|1 cobblestone|r200||Azure Bluet|2 light gray dye<br>2 white dye (10%)|r50||Beetroot|2 red dye<br>1 beetroot seeds (10%)|r70||Blue Orchid|2 light blue dye<br>1 light gray dye (5%)|r50||Bone|3 bone meal<br>3 bone meal (25%)<br>1 white dye (25%)|r100||Bone Meal|2 white dye<br>1 light gray dye (10%)|r70||Cactus|2 green dye<br>1 green dye (10%)|r50||Calcite|1 bonemeal (75%)|r250||Charcoal|1 black dye<br>2 gray dye (10%)|r100||Clay|3 clay balls<br>1 clay ball (50%)|r50||Coal|2 black dye<br>1 gray dye (10%)|r100||Cobblestone|1 gravel|r250||Cocoa Beans|2 brown dye<br>1 brown dye (10%)|r70||Cornflower|2 blue dye|r50||Dandelion|2 yellow dye<br>1 yellow dye (5%)|r50||Dripstone Block|1 clay ball|r250||Fern|1 green dye<br>1 wheat seeds (10%)|r50||Granite|1 red sand|r200||Grass|1 wheat seeds (25%)|r50||Gravel|1 flint|r250||Ink Sac|2 black dye<br>1 gray dye (10%)|r100||Lapis Lazuli|2 blue dye<br>1 blue dye (10%)|r100||Large Fern|2 green dye<br>1 green dye (50%)<br>1 wheat seeds (10%)|r50||Lilac|3 magenta dye<br>1 magenta dye (25%)<br>1 purple dye (25%)|r100||Lily of the Valley|2 white dye<br>1 white dye (10%)<br>1 lime dye (10%)|r50||Orange Tulip|2 orange dye<br>1 lime dye (10%)|r50||Oxeye Daisy|2 light gray dye<br>1 white dye (20%)<br>1 yellow dye (5%)|r50||Peony|3 pink dye<br>1 pink dye (25%)<br>1 magenta dye (25%)|r100||Pink Tulip|2 pink dye<br>1 lime dye (10%)|r50||Poppy|2 red dye<br>1 green dye (5%)|r50||Red Tulip|2 red dye<br>1 lime dye (10%)|r50||Rose Bush|3 red dye<br>2 red dye (25%)<br>2 green dye (5%)|r50||Saddle|2 leather<br>2 leather (50%)|r200||Sandstone|1 sand|r150||Sea Pickle|2 lime dye<br>1 green dye (10%)|r50||Sugar Cane|2 sugar<br>1 sugar (10%)|r50||Sunflower|3 yellow dye<br>1 yellow dye (25%)<br>1 orange dye (25%)|r100||Terracotta|1 red sand|r200||Tall Grass|1 wheat seeds (50%)|r100||White Tulip|2 white dye<br>1 lime dye (10%)|r50||Wheat|1 wheat flour<br>2 wheat flour (25%)<br>1 wheat seeds (25%)|r150||Wither Rose|2 black dye<br>1 black dye (10%)|r50||Wool|1 string|r100table>><br>Upon using a millstone, the advancement Embrace the Grind will be awarded.</div>
