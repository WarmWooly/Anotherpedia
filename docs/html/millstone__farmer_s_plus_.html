A millstone can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 grindstone (Minecraft) and 1 stone slab (Minecraft) (place the grindstone above the slab).
Up to a stack of item (Minecraft) can be inserted into a millstone. To mill, the player must hold down on the millstone. Ground items will then pop out to be collected. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This doesn't seem millable..." will appear. These are the recipes that the millstone can be used to perform (outputs with % only have a percent chance of being produced):<<table{{bInput}}|{{bOutputs}}||Beef Tongue Slice (Farmer's Plus)|2 minced beef (Farmer's Delight)||Bone (Minecraft)|3 bone meal (Minecraft)&sp3 bone meal (25%)&sp1 white dye (Minecraft) (25%)||Bread (Minecraft)|3 bread crumb (Farmer's Plus)&sp1 bread crumb (25%)||Cobbled Deepslate (Minecraft)|1 gravel (Minecraft)||Cobblestone (Minecraft)|1 gravel (Minecraft)||Gravel (Minecraft)|1 sand (Minecraft)&sp1 flint (Minecraft) (25%)||Raw Beef (Minecraft)|3 minced beef (Farmer's Delight)&sp1 minced beef (25%)||Raw Chicken (Minecraft)|3 minced chicken (Farmer's Plus)&sp1 minced chicken (25%)||Raw Pork (Minecraft)|3 minced pork (Farmer's Plus)&sp1 minced pork (25%)||Rice (Farmer's Delight)|3 rice flour (Farmer's Plus)&sp1 rice flour (25%)||Sugar Cane (Minecraft)|2 sugar (Minecraft)&sp1 sugar (10%)||Wheat (Minecraft)|3 wheat flour (Farmer's Plus)&sp1 wheat flour (25%)table>></div>
