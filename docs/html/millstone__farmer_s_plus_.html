A millstone can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 grindstone (Minecraft) and 1 stone slab (Minecraft) (place the grindstone above the slab).



Up to a stack of item (Minecraft) can be inserted into a millstone. To mill, the player must hold down on the millstone. Ground items will then pop out to be collected. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This doesn't seem millable..." will appear. These are the recipes that the millstone can be used to perform (outputs with % only have a percent chance of being produced):<<tableInput|Outputs||Beef Tongue Slice (Farmer's Plus)|2 minced beef (Farmer's Delight)||Bone (Minecraft)|3 bone meal (Minecraft)<br>3 bone meal (25%)<br>1 white dye (Minecraft) (25%)||Bread (Minecraft)|3 bread crumb (Farmer's Plus)<br>1 bread crumb (25%)||Cobbled Deepslate (Minecraft)|1 gravel (Minecraft)||Cobblestone (Minecraft)|1 gravel (Minecraft)||Gravel (Minecraft)|1 sand (Minecraft)<br>1 flint (Minecraft) (25%)||Raw Beef (Minecraft)|3 minced beef (Farmer's Delight)<br>1 minced beef (25%)||Raw Chicken (Minecraft)|3 minced chicken (Farmer's Plus)<br>1 minced chicken (25%)||Raw Pork (Minecraft)|3 minced pork (Farmer's Plus)<br>1 minced pork (25%)||Rice (Farmer's Delight)|3 rice flour (Farmer's Plus)<br>1 rice flour (25%)||Sugar Cane (Minecraft)|2 sugar (Minecraft)<br>1 sugar (10%)||Wheat (Minecraft)|3 wheat flour (Farmer's Plus)<br>1 wheat flour (25%)table>></div>
