They come in three tiers: the millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined), the powered millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined), and the refined millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined).
All three millstones can be crafting (Minecraft), with the previous tier utilized in its successor's recipe. The advancement (Minecraft) Mechanized Milling (Bread Reborn: Redefined) and Milling Mastery (Bread Reborn: Redefined) are awarded for crafting the powered millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined) and refined millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined) respectively.
Main page: Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined)}}&spTo use a millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the main hand (Minecraft). Upon interacting with a millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the powered or refined millstone is powered, up to 4/16 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete hunger (Minecraft). When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. A millstone can be mute when placed on wool (Minecraft). With an open hand, a millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while sneaking (Minecraft).
When a powered or refined millstone is powered, the millstone will rotate once, processing up to 4/16 Item (Minecraft entity) above it. If the block below it is open, the produced flours (Bread Reborn: Redefined) will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a hopper (Minecraft).
A redstone comparator can read a millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the millstone is from its resting position.<<note(content=Internally, the millstones are considered containers with a single item slot with a max stack size of 7. For each of the rotated states, 1--7 placeholder rotatium (Bread Reborn: Redefined) are stored to trigger the comparator.(text=noteCountnote>> The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<tableState|Deg|Signal||0|r0&deg|r0||1|r45&deg|r3||2|r90&deg|r5||3|r135&deg|r7||4|r180&deg|r9||5|r225&deg|r11||6|r270&deg|r13||7|r315&deg|r15table>></div>
