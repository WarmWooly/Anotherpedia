They come in three tiers: the [[millstone|millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]], the [[powered millstone|powered millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]], and the [[refined millstone|refined millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]].<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>All three millstones can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]], with the previous tier utilized in its successor's recipe. The [[advancements|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Mechanized Milling|Mechanized Milling (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] and [[Milling Mastery|Milling Mastery (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] are awarded for crafting the [[powered|powered millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] and [[refined millstones|refined millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] respectively.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Millinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined}})]]}}&spTo use a millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the [[main hand|main hand (Minecraft)]]. Upon interacting with a millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the powered or refined millstone is powered, up to 4/16 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete [[hunger|hunger (Minecraft)]]. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. A millstone can be [[muted|mute]] when placed on [[wool|wool (Minecraft)]]. With an open hand, a millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while [[sneaking|sneaking (Minecraft)]].<<hr2Redstonehr2>>When a powered or refined millstone is powered, the millstone will rotate once, processing up to 4/16 [[items|Item (Minecraft entity)]] above it. If the block below it is open, the produced [[flour|flours (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a [[hopper|hopper (Minecraft)]].<<hr3Redstone signalhr3>>A [[redstone comparator]] can read a millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the millstone is from its resting position.<<note(content=Internally, the millstones are considered containers with a single item slot with a max stack size of 7. For each of the rotated states, 1--7 placeholder [[rotatium|rotatium (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] are stored to trigger the comparator.(text=noteCountnote>> The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<table{{bState}}|{{bDeg}}|{{bSignal}}||0|{{r0&deg}}|{{r0}}||1|{{r45&deg}}|{{r3}}||2|{{r90&deg}}|{{r5}}||3|{{r135&deg}}|{{r7}}||4|{{r180&deg}}|{{r9}}||5|{{r225&deg}}|{{r11}}||6|{{r270&deg}}|{{r13}}||7|{{r315&deg}}|{{r15}}table>></div>
