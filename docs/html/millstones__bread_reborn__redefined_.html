They come in three tiers: the millstone, the powered millstone, and the refined millstone.
All three millstones can be crafted, with the previous tier utilized in its successor's recipe. The advancements Mechanized Milling and Milling Mastery are awarded for crafting the powered and refined millstones respectively.
Main page: Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined)}}&spTo use a millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the main hand. Upon interacting with a millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the powered or refined millstone is powered, up to 4/16 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete hunger. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. A millstone can be muted when placed on wool. With an open hand, a millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while sneaking.
When a powered or refined millstone is powered, the millstone will rotate once, processing up to 4/16 items above it. If the block below it is open, the produced flour will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a hopper.
A redstone comparator can read a millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the millstone is from its resting position.<<note(content=Internally, the millstones are considered containers with a single item slot with a max stack size of 7. For each of the rotated states, 1--7 placeholder rotatium are stored to trigger the comparator.(text=noteCountnote>> The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<tableState|Deg|Signal||0|r0&deg|r0||1|r45&deg|r3||2|r90&deg|r5||3|r135&deg|r7||4|r180&deg|r9||5|r225&deg|r11||6|r270&deg|r13||7|r315&deg|r15table>></div>
