Door (Minecraft) can now be formed into double doors with different kinds of materials.&pThere are now new IDs for double slab blocks of double_stone_block_slab2, double_stone_block_slab3, and double_stone_block_slab4, alongside unique variations for the prismarine block ID.<<table{{cBefore}}|{{cAfter}}||double_stone_block_slab2|dark_prismarine_double_slab&spmossy_cobblestone_double_slab&spprismarine_brick_double_slab&spprismarine_double_slab&sppurpur_double_slab&spred_nether_brick_double_slab&spred_sandstone_double_slab&spsmooth_sandstone_double_slab||double_stone_block_slab3|andesite_double_slab&spdiorite_double_slab&spend_stone_brick_double_slab&spgranite_double_slab&sppolished_andesite_double_slab&sppolished_diorite_double_slab&sppolished_granite_double_slab&spsmooth_red_sandstone_double_slab||double_stone_block_slab4|cut_red_sandstone_double_slab&spcut_sandstone_double_slab&spmossy_stone_brick_double_slab&spnormal_stone_double_slab&spsmooth_quartz_double_slab||prismarine|dark_prismarine&spprismarine&spprismarine_brickstable>>&spSome of these blocks have also had changes to their destruction time (Minecraft).<<table{{cBlock}}|{{cTime}}||dark_prismarine_double_slab&spprismarine_brick_double_slab&spprismarine_double_slab|1.5||end_stone_brick_double_slab|3.0||andesite_double_slab&spdiorite_double_slab&spgranite_double_slab&sppolished_andesite_double_slab&sppolished_diorite_double_slab&sppolished_granite_double_slab|1.5||mossy_stone_brick_double_slab|1.5table>>&spWind Charge (Minecraft) now move 50% faster when thrown by a player (Minecraft), matching Java.&pThere is now a game tip for emotes (Minecraft) that is triggered when a player is near another remote player with the player in the world for at least 30 seconds.&pA small change has been made to calculating the position of dismounting from vehicles, which can result in a different dismount location when dismounting from faster vehicles.&pThe Heavy Core (Minecraft), Mace (Minecraft), and Trident (Minecraft) now are considered to have the rarity (Minecraft) (magenta item name). Rarity coloring has also been applied in the tooltip (Minecraft) of the Creeper Charge Banner Pattern (Minecraft), Flow Banner Pattern (Minecraft), Guster Banner Pattern (Minecraft), Skull Charge Banner Pattern (Minecraft), and Thing Banner Pattern (Minecraft) Banner Pattern (Minecraft).&pReports through Realms now allows more context/information on why a report is being made.&pDrowned (Minecraft) now only spawn in groups of 1 and not 2, matching Java.&pA sound effect has been added when interacting with Vault (Minecraft) that have already been looted.
Entity Permutations, Volume and volumearea (Minecraft), and Entity Aliases are now depreciated (programming). Entity Aliases are depreciated when the format_version is 1.21.10 or higher.&pIn the API, the following have been moved or released:<<table{{cName}}|{{cBefore}}|{{cAfter}}|{{cProperties}}|{{cFunctions}}||codeWorldInitializeBeforeEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeWorldInitializeBeforeEventSignal|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentRegistry|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemCustomComponent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentBeforeDurabilityDamageEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentCompleteUseEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentConsumeEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentHitEntityEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentMineBlockEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentUseEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeItemComponentUseOnEvent|codebeta|code1.12.0|N/A|N/A||codeEntityTamableComponent|codebeta|code1.12.0|codegetTameItems, codeisTamed, codeprobability, codetamedToPlayer, codetamedToPlayerId|codetame||codeEntityAgeableComponent|codebeta|code1.12.0|codeduration, codegrowUp, codetransformToItem|codegetDropItems, codegetFeedItems, codeEntityDefinitionFeedItem, codeTriggertable>>&spThe server-net module can be used in local editor extensions.&pThe view offset for the 3rd person camera has been added for the experimental codefollow_orbit preset. This offset is anchored to a pivot point in the center of the screen, with the player shifted by the codefollow_orbit preset}} between 100 and -100. Both JSON and command (Minecraft) can be used to influence this, with the following example:Starting radius and rotation for the codefollow_orbit and 3rd person boom camera presets have been added. The radius determines the camera distance from the player (fixed at 10 blocks) and the rotation determines pitch and yaw (fixed at 45X and 45Y). The 3rd person boom camera preset is not available in 1.21.10.22. &pThe exposed radius component from behavior pack (Minecraft) to be overwritten by creator cameras.&pcodeminecraft:third_person and codeminecraft:third_person_front have been added to the allow list of presets that can be inherited from, enabling the creation of a camera based on the vanilla 3rd person camera with a variable radius, only limited through render distance (Minecraft) and other constraints imposed by the game. This does not modify the vanilla camera.&pIn the Editor, the keybind D had been removed for Fixed Distance mode in Paste Preview as it overrode the ability to move right (using standard WASD). It can now be selected in a side panel. The Block Palette Service API now allows the management of Block Palettes and Block Palette Items. Radial drag (UI) has been added to number input. A new script brush manager method, codegetBrushVolume, when given a set of brush pipeline operations, will now create an absolute compound block volume for the brush.&pThe new subcomponent for Projectiles, code wind_burst_on_hit, will create a wind burst effect on collision with blocks and entity (Minecraft) before being destroyed.&pThe codeminecraft:scatter_feature now has a field for distribution to define the scattering settings of feature (Minecraft).<<ref(content=link|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/featuresreference/examples/features/minecraftscatter_feature?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable(text=refCountref>> These features now use the schema setting of code1.21.10.&pFor 1.21.10 formats and higher, the codeminecraft:custom_components has been released from experimental. codeslot.armor.body can be used on entities as an extra armor slot for single-slotted entities (such as Horse (Minecraft) with Horse Armor (Minecraft)) to gain the full effects of an armor set. codeminecraft:damage_absorption can be added to items to take the damage intended for the wearer. codeabsorbable_causes allows what type(s) of damage to be absorbed/ignored. The item must be in an armor slot to absorb damage, with durability damaged on absorption. Extra damage is dealt to the entity and ignored by the item's durability. When there are multiple items with codeminecraft:damage_absorption, one is selected at random. codeminecraft:durability_sensor can be added to items to create sounds and particles at different durability levels as defined through codedurability_thresholds. If multiple thresholds are met, only the lowest is run.
codeplayerEmote has been added, which fires when a player uses an emote.&pWith the codeonTick event, blocks require codeminecraft:tick to determine their behaviors on ticks. Generated blocks with codeminecraft:tick will now tick.&pIn the Deferred Technical Preview, there is now a Brightness/Gamma calibration screen. It can be found under Deferred Graphics Settings in the Video settings.
