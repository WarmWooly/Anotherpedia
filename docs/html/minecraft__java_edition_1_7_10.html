      <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with the update {{aiMinecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.7.10.}}&sp1.7.10 was a minor update to Minecraft: Java Edition on June 26, 2014 following 1.7.9 and preceding 1.8. It had 4 pre-releases: 1.7.10-pre1, 1.7.10-pre2, 1.7.10-pre3, and 1.7.10-pre4. It expanded upon Minecraft Realms, giving more permissions and power to the owner.
In Minecraft Realms, users could now upload their own worlds, monitor players, toggle PVP, difficulty, spawn protection, gamemode mob spawning, and command blocks.
The way Realms updates were handled was separated from Minecraft updates, no longer requiring new versions (such as 1.7.10) to update Realms. UI also got a marginal improvement.
