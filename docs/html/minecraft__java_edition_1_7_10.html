  <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10</h1>
  <div>{{tNot to be confused with the update {{aiMinecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition}} Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.7.10.}}&sp{{b1.7.10}} was a minor update to {{iMinecraft Minecraft: Java Edition}} on June 26, 2014 following Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.9 and preceding Minecraft: Java Edition 1.8. It had 4 pre-releases: Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10-pre1, Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10-pre2, Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10-pre3, and Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10-pre4. It expanded upon {{iMinecraft}} Realms, giving more permissions and power to the owner.
In {{iMinecraft}} Realms, users could now upload their own World (Minecraft), monitor Player (Minecraft), toggle PVP (Minecraft), Difficulty (Minecraft), Spawn (Minecraft) protection, gamemode (Minecraft) Mob (Minecraft) spawning, and Command block (Minecraft).
The way Realms updates were handled was separated from {{iMinecraft}} updates, no longer requiring new versions (such as 1.7.10) to update Realms. User interface also got a marginal improvement.
MC-3256 - Large TNT (Minecraft) chain reaction would have a memory leak.&spMC-19992 - Player data from Server (Minecraft) would be case-sensitive.&spMC-39077 - Poor performance when a single person hosted a server.&spMC-46398 - Command blocks would stop working in Realms.&spMC-55580 - When a player is uninvited and reinvited into a Realm, they will still have operator (Minecraft) permissions.&spMC-59612 - Inability to view Realms version.&spMC-62821 - The icon (computing) hitbox for the envelope was not aligned properly.</div>
