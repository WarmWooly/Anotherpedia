      <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with the update aiMinecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.7.10.<br>1.7.10 was a minor update to Minecraft: Java Edition on June 26, 2014 following 1.7.9 and preceding 1.8. It had 4 pre-releases: 1.7.10-pre1, 1.7.10-pre2, 1.7.10-pre3, and 1.7.10-pre4. It expanded upon Minecraft Realms, giving more permissions and power to the owner.

In Minecraft Realms, users could now upload their own worlds, monitor players, toggle PVP, difficulty, spawn protection, gamemode mob spawning, and command blocks.

The way Realms updates were handled was separated from Minecraft updates, no longer requiring new versions (such as 1.7.10) to update Realms. UI also got a marginal improvement.

MC-3256 - Large TNT chain reactions would have a memory leak.<br>MC-19992 - Player data from servers would be case-sensitive.<br>MC-39077 - Poor performance when a single person hosted a server.<br>MC-46398 - Command blocks would stop working in Realms.<br>MC-55580 - When a player is uninvited and reinvited into a Realm, they will still have OP permissions.<br>MC-59612 - Inability to view Realms version.<br>MC-62821 - The icon hitbox for the envelope was not aligned properly.</div>
