  <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.6</h1>
  <div>{{b1.7.6}} was a minor update to {{iMinecraft Minecraft: Java Edition}} on April 9, 2014 following Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.5 and preceding Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.7. It had 2 pre-releases: Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.6-pre1 and Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.6-pre2. It updated the system used for player (Minecraft) to change skin (Minecraft) and set up the framework for changing name (Minecraft).
{{iMinecraft}} Realms had a new configuration screen, where players could be easily invited, uninvited, and operator (Minecraft). The setting for Field of View (Minecraft) now has a minimum of 30 from the old 70. Players could now set server resource packs before joining. Support for changing names was added (but it will be until February 4, 2015, before names could be changed). A dedicated server now distributes player's skins, no longer download duplicate skins, has fewer server outage, will not require a game restart to change skins, and Server (Minecraft) cannot effect skins.
MC-31468 - An interaction between flaming arrow (Minecraft) and TNT (Minecraft) could cause TNT to teleport where the arrow landed, breaking block (Minecraft) such as bedrock (Minecraft).&spMC-33084 - Save-all causes major lagspike on servers with large world (Minecraft).&spMC-47723 - In the broadcasting settings, pressing the "Report to Mojang" button links to "mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MC" and not "bugs.mojang.com".&spMC-48826 - When a sound JSON is run, the "replace" property (JSON) does not replace sounds of the same name when true (programming).&spMC-51953 - The rendering was distortion as if it was under a fisheye lens, causing motion sickness.</div>
