      <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.6</h1>
      <div>1.7.6 was a minor update to Minecraft: Java Edition on April 9, 2014 following 1.7.5 and preceding 1.7.7. It had 2 pre-releases: 1.7.6-pre1 and 1.7.6-pre2. It updated the system used for players to change skins and set up the framework for changing names.

Minecraft Realms had a new configuration screen, where players could be easily invited, uninvited, and OPed. The setting for FOV now has a minimum of 30 from the old 70. Players could now set server resource packs before joining. Support for changing names was added (but it will be until February 4, 2015, before names could be changed). A dedicated server now distributes player's skins, no longer downloads duplicate skins, has fewer outages, will not require a game restart to change skins, and Minecraft servers cannot effect skins.

MC-31468 - An interaction between flaming arrows and TNT could cause TNT to teleport where the arrow landed, breaking blocks such as bedrock.<br>MC-33084 - Save-all causes major lagspikes on servers with large maps.<br>MC-47723 - In the broadcasting settings, pressing the "Report to Mojang" button links to "mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MC" and not "bugs.mojang.com".<br>MC-48826 - When a sound JSON is run, the "replace" property does not replace sounds of the same name when true.<br>MC-51953 - The rendering was distorted as if it was under a fisheye lens, causing motion sickness.</div>
