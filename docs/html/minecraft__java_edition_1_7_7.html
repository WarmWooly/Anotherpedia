      <div>1.7.7 was a minor update to Minecraft: Java Edition on April 9, 2014 following 1.7.6 and preceding 1.7.8. It fixed crahses that could occur on servers caused by the prior update. It was reuploaded on April 10 to remove the message "Outdated server! pretending to be 1.7.7" that would prevent players from joining some servers.</div>
