  <div>{{b1.7.7}} was a minor update to {{iMinecraft Minecraft: Java Edition}} on April 9, 2014 following Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.6 and preceding Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.8. It fixed crash (Minecraft) that could occur on server (Minecraft) caused by the prior update. It was reuploaded on April 10 to remove the message "Outdated server! pretending to be 1.7.7" that would prevent player (Minecraft) from joining some servers.</div>
