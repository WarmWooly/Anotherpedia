      <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.8</h1>
      <div>1.7.8 was a minor update to Minecraft: Java Edition on April 11, 2014 following 1.7.7 and preceding 1.7.9. It fixed crashes and problems with skins.

Servers now automatically kick players when they are on for 23 hours and 59 minutes. Also, before streaming to Twitch, it will show a confirmation screen.

MC-52639 - On an update, chunks could be corrupted.<br>MC-52652 - Changes to how the banlist was handled caused an error when a player was banned for "Forever".<br>MC-52668 - Player heads would lose their name when placed on the ground and picked up and would revert to the Steve texture when placed on mobs because the NBT "SkullOwner" would expect a TAG_Compound but get a TAG_String. <br>MC-52673 - The invert mouse setting would reset itself to "off" when closing and reopening Minecraft.<br>MC-52718 - The skin server was broken, reverting the skins of players to Steve.<br>MC-52755 - When a player is on a server for 24 hours or changes their time, their skin will "expire" and kick them from the server.</div>
