      <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.9</h1>
      <div>1.7.9 was a minor update to Minecraft Minecraft: Java Edition on April 14, 2014 following Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.8 and preceding Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.10. It added the Minecraft Realms button, Skin (Minecraft) fixes, and increased name conversion speeds.

The button for Minecraft Realms was now visible on the title screen, but it lacked functionality. Name (Minecraft) would now be converted faster. Support for a new skin system was added, fewer restriction were in place for skins, and Server (Minecraft) would be much less likely to have problems sending skin information.

MC-4812 - Piston (Minecraft) arms would be pitch black in the End (Minecraft).<br>MC-51786 - Player (Minecraft) would automatically be given operator (Minecraft) permissions invited into a Realm.<br>MC-52719 - When attempting to join a server, the message "Outdated server! pretending to be 1.7.7" (or 1.7.8) would appear, preventing the connection.<br>MC-52817 - On a server, if a player with a slow connection teleport (Minecraft) a large distance and back with another player in the Chunk (Minecraft) too fast, the server would despawn and spawn the player on the same tick (Minecraft), disconnecting the other player from the server.</div>
