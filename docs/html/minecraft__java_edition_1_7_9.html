      <h1>Minecraft: Java Edition 1.7.9</h1>
      <div>1.7.9 was a minor update to Minecraft: Java Edition on April 14, 2014 following 1.7.8 and preceding 1.7.10. It added the Minecraft Realms button, skin fixes, and increased name conversion speeds.

The button for Minecraft Realms was now visible on the title screen, but it lacked functionality. Names would now be converted faster. Support for a new skin system was added, fewer restrictions were in place for skins, and servers would be much less likely to have problems sending skin information.

MC-4812 - Piston arms would be pitch black in the End.<br>MC-51786 - Players would automatically be given OP permissions invited into a Realm.<br>MC-52719 - When attempting to join a server, the message "Outdated server! pretending to be 1.7.7" (or 1.7.8) would appear, preventing the connection.<br>MC-52817 - On a server, if a player with a slow connection teleports a large distance and back with another player in the chunk too fast, the server would despawn and spawn the player on the same tick, disconnecting the other player from the server.</div>
