      <h1>Minecraft Mob Vote</h1>
      <div>The {{iMinecraft Mob Vote}} was an annual part of MINECON Earth and Minecraft Live, where a vote was cast on 3-4 mob (minecraft) to be added to the Minecraft. It was mainly used as a method to increase interest for the upcoming update that the vote is appended to. It has since been ended in 2024.



In 2017, during MINECON Earth 2017, the 2017 Mob Vote was held, being the first Mob Vote. It was for Update Aquatic (Minecraft). The contestants were The Monster of the Night Skies (Phantom (Minecraft)), The Monster of the Ocean Depths (Barnacle), The Great Hunger, and The Hovering Inferno (Wildfire (Minecraft)), with the Phantom being the win.

In 2020, during Minecraft Live 2020, the 2020 Mob Vote was held. It was for Caves and Cliffs (Minecraft). The contestants were the Glow Squid (Minecraft), Moobloom (Minecraft), and the Iceologer (Minecraft), with the Glow Squid being the winner. There was some turmoil of the YouTuber Dream (YouTuber) potentially swaying the votes.

In 2021, during Minecraft Live 2021, the 2021 Mob Vote was held. It was for The Wild Update (Minecraft). The contestants were the Allay (Minecraft), Glare (Minecraft), and the Copper Golem (Minecraft), with the Allay being the winner.

In 2022, during Minecraft Live 2022, the 2022 Mob Vote was held. It was for Trails and Tales (Minecraft). The contestants were the Sniffer (Minecraft), Rascal (Minecraft), and the Tuff Golem (Minecraft), with the Sniffer being the winner.

In 2023, during Minecraft Live 2023, the 2023 Mob Vote was held. It was for Tricky Trails (Minecraft), but was released early for Minecraft 1.20.5. The contestants were the Armadillo (Minecraft), Crab (Minecraft), and the Penguin (Minecraft), with the Armadillo being the winner. It's also notable for #stopthemobvote and the alleged rigging of the vote.



In 2016, Jens Bergensten held a vote between the 2016 Llama/Alpaca Mob Vote on the Minecraft Forum. It was for Exploration Update (Minecraft). The contestants were the Llama (Minecraft), Alpaca, Both, or Neither, with the Llama being the winner.

In 2018, Minecraft's Twitter account held a vote between 2018 Cat Mob Vote of cat (Minecraft). It was for Update Aquatic (Minecraft). The contestants were Jellie, Zach, and Coco, with Jellie being the winner.

In 2018, during MINECON Earth 2018, a 2018 China Mob Vote was held. It was for Update Aquatic (Minecraft). The contestants were the Panda (Minecraft), Alligator, Monkey, Deer, or River Dolphin, with the Panda being the winner.

Mob Votes were officially ended on September 9th, 2024, in addition to changing the format for Minecraft Live. There are many possible reasons for the ending of the Minecraft Mob Vote, including smaller, but more frequent, updates to the game, the lack of popularity in 2023 leading to a petition that garnered over half a million signatures to end the vote, and/or the changing of the Minecraft Live format.</div>
