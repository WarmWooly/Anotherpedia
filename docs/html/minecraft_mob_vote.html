Mob Votes were officially ended on September 9th, 2024, in addition to changing the format for {{iMinecraft}} Live. There are many possible reasons for the ending of the {{iMinecraft}} Mob Vote, including smaller, but more frequent, updates to the game, the lack of popularity in 2023 leading to a petition that garnered over half a million signatures to end the vote,<<ref(content=link|https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-mob-vote-put-an-end-to-the-scrapping-of-great-ideas(text=refCountref>> and/or the changing of the {{iMinecraft}} Live format.</div>
