      <h1>Minecraft modding</h1>
      <div>For the similar alterations to {{aiMinecraft through the marketplace, see aiMinecraft add-ons.}}&sp{{iMinecraft modding}} is the modding of the game Minecraft, adding or updating mechanics, features, and processes of the base game. Mods can add new items, blocks, mobs, and dimensions, tweak or improve existing features, optimize for performance, and fully convert the gameplay of Minecraft. There have been thousands of mods made, with the modding scene continuing to grow, and some of the most prominent mod makers making a profit off their mods. There are also multiple mod loaders to search for, compile, and run modpacks. While Mojang Studios has not released an API for mod making, various community tools (such as Blockbench, Bukkit, and MCreator) have been made to aid and assist the modding process. Modding has even influenced additions added to Minecraft itself, including horses originally from Dr. Zhark's Mo' Creatures<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/jeb_/status/319938276003827712(text=refCountref>> and pistons created by Hippoplatimus and DiEvAl.<<ref(content=link|https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272764-1-1-piston-patch-updated-for-1-1(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/hvkmo/attribution_of_the_piston_mod_in_vanilla_minecraft/(text=refCountref>></div>
