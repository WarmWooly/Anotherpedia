      <h1>Mini Motorways (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Mini Motorways is a medium-sized outdoor map in Laser Fight based on the Mini Motorways map Munich. Players can spawn in the blue/white neighborhood, the black business, the three tree clusters, or the two tree clusters. Roads line the map between houses, with businesses scattered about. Houses and trees can be vaulted over, while the ledges of businesses can be grabbed. The motorway can be slid into to launch the player across the map.</div>
