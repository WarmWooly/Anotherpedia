  <h1>Minion Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)</h1>
  <div><<info||{{bStats}}||{{bHealth}}|1 HP||{{bSpeed}}|1.55x base (155%--465%)||{{bSize}}|0.5x base (50%--40%)info>>The {{bMinion Roomba}} is an enemy in {{iAttack of the Roombas}} that is generated from the Factory Roomba (Attack of the Roombas) or the Final Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas). Every 10 seconds (or 12 seconds if it just spawned), a Minion Roomba will be generated. They are very weak, but can easily corner the player (Attack of the Roombas) if they are caught in the middle of reloading. Minion Roombas do not award a kill on destruction.</div>
