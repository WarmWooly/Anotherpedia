      <h1>Mobile network operator</h1>
      <div>A mobile network operator, also known as a wireless service provider, phone provider, wireless carrier, phone carrier, mobile network carrier, cellular company, or MNO, provides and controls wireless communication. Mobile network operators provide an allocated radio spectrum, wireless network and backhaul infrastructure, customer service, billing, repair, and marketing. Operators who do not own their own infrastructure, but rather have an agreement with an MNO to use preexisting infrastructure, are known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).</div>
