      <h1>Mobile Task Force (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Mobile Task Force (MTF) is a role (SCP: Devolved Revamp) within SCP: Devolved Revamp who recontain SCPs (SCP: Devolved Revamp), fight off Chaos Insurgency (SCP: Devolved Revamp) or rouge Class D SCP: Devolved Revamp and protect the map (SCP: Devolved Revamp). The MTF gets a Colt M4A1 (SCP: Devolved Revamp) at rank one, which they can use on CI and rogue Class D player (Roblox). MTF members should focus on recontaining SCPs that are breached, fighting hostiles like rogue Class D or CI when they invade the facility, follow orders from administrative branch (SCP: Devolved Revamp), and protect the site and SCPs from being breached. 

The MTF has 5 levels, with each giving a new title and a new weapon. At level 4, their keycards (SCP: Devolved Revamp) access also increases.<<table |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Level 4|Level 5||Title|"Junior Operative"|"Combat Operative"|"Senior Operative"|"Task Force Officer"|"Commander"||Guns|Colt M4A1 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|SIG P226 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|SCAR-H (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|IMI Mini UZI (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|M249 SAW (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||Keycard|Level 3 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|Level 3|Level 3|Level 4 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)|Level 4table>>

MTFs spawn at a  helicopter pad by a cave entrance outside the facility of the map (SCP: Devolved Revamp). The cave can only be entered by MTF, meaning no other role can enter, and it doesn't require a keycard to enter the cave. The helicopter pad is located in the middle back of the spawn area, and a few trees can be seen as well as the ocean, which is right behind the MTF spawn. Trees and cliff surround the edges of the spawn, and a cave can be seen by following the short path from the MTF spawn. By the cave there lies two MTF uniforms, a Nu-7 SCP: Devolved Revamp uniform and a Epsilon-11 SCP: Devolved Revamp uniform and to the left corner near the cave is a storage container with a special Mobile Task Force Commander uniform for players who owned the game pass MTF Commander from SCP: Devolved Classic. The cave is relatively short, filled with elevated rock and crystals across the path. At the end of the cave, you exit to the entrance of the facility. Before entering the cave, there is also a TV that says the following:For Mobile Task Force:<br>- you are the best of the best<br>- recontain breached SCPs<br>- defend against hostile outsiders<br>- terminate runaway escapees<br>- bring order to the facility<br>- follow orders from administration</div>
