  <div><<shortUpgrades to cards and Jokers in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/balatro modifiers.png(cap=From top to bottom: Editions on [[Jokers|Joker (Balatro)]], Enhancements without card values, and Seals without card values.img>>{{bModifiers}} are [[upgrades|upgrade]] that can be added to [[playing cards|playing cards (Balatro)]], [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]], and in some cases [[Consumables|Consumables (Balatro)]]. There are three types of Modifiers: [[Editions|Editions (Balatro)]], [[Enhancements|Enhancements (Balatro)]], and [[Seals|Seals (Balatro)]]. Only one of each Modifier can be on playing cards, and Jokers can only get Editions. Consumables, by using the Joker [[Perko|Perko (Balatro)]], can get the [[Negative|Negative (Balatro)]] Edition. Modifiers will automatically overwrite the previous Modifer of the same type, such as turning a [[Steel Card|Steel Card (Balatro)]] into a [[Gold Card|Gold Card (Balatro)]]. However, different Modifiers will not affect other Modifiers, such as putting a [[Blue Seal|Blue Seal (Balatro)]] on a [[Polychome|Polychome (Balatro)]].&pModifiers serve to aid the player in a [[run|run (Balatro)]], such as increasing [[chips|chips (Balatro)]] or the [[mult|multiplier (Balatro)]], giving [[money|money (Balatro)]], creating [[Planet|Planet Cards (Balatro)]] or [[Tarot Cards|Tarot Cards (Balatro)]], acting as every [[Suit|Suit (Balatro)]], and adding more Joker slots. Modifiers can be added to or be more likely to appear on cards using Jokers, [[Tags|Tags (Balatro)]], [[Vouchers|Vouchers (Balatro)]], Tarot Cards, [[Spectral Cards|Spectral Cards (Balatro)]], or by buying cards in [[the Shop|the Shop (Balatro)]] or from [[booster packs|booster packs (Balatro)]].</div>
