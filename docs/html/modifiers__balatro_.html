      <h1>Modifiers (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Modifiers are upgrades that can be added to playing cards, Jokers, and in some cases Consumables. There are three types of Modifiers: Editions, Enhancements, and Seals. Only one of each Modifier can be on playing cards, and Jokers can only get Editions. Consumables, by using the Joker Perko, can get the Negative Edition. Modifiers will automatically overwrite the previous Modifer of the same type, such as turning a Steel Card into a Gold Card. However, different Modifiers will not affect other Modifiers, such as putting a Blue Seal on a Polychome.<br><br>Modifiers serve to aid the player in a run, such as increasing chips or the mult, giving money, creating Planet or Tarot Cards, acting as every Suit, and adding more Joker slots. Modifiers can be added to or be more likely to appear on cards using Jokers, Tags, Vouchers, Tarot Cards, Spectral Cards, or by buying cards in the Shop or from booster packs.</div>
