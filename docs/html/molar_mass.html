      <h1>Molar mass</h1>
      <div>Molar mass, represented as M, is the measurement of the density of a compound, measured in kg/mol (or g/mol for smaller use cases). Molar mass is only the average mass of a compound due to unaccounted isotopes. Molar mass can be used to find how many atoms an object contains based on the moles of the substance and the object's mass.</div>
