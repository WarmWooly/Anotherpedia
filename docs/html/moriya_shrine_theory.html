  <h1>Moriya Shrine theory</h1>
  <div>The {{bMoriya Shrine theory}} is a fan-made video game theory pertaining to {{iTouhou Project}} claiming that all main-line Touhou Project games incidents in Gensokyo (Touhou Project) happen as a result of the Moriya Shrine (Touhou Project). This theory originates from 2009--11, connecting the most recent games at the time. It stems from the fact that the Moriya Shrine can be traced back to the incidents of main-line {{iTouhou Project}} games as the root cause or reason for those incidents and games happening. This theory later became a meme and extended to things outside {{iTouhou Project}}.
The incident of {{iTouhou Fuujinroku ~ Mountain of Faith}} begins when the Moriya Shrine antagonizes the Hakurei Shrine (Touhou Project) to get it to shut down for good for the purpose of allowing the god Kanako Yasaka (Touhou Project) to monopolize the faith in Gensokyo. This incident is, of course, directly caused by the Moriya Shrine.
The incident of {{iTouhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism}} begins when Utsuho Reiuji (Touhou Project) has an encounter with "a god" that came down from "above ground", gifting her and telling her to consume the Yatagarasu. After doing so, this god tells her to use them, planning to use the power of nuclear fusion to generate massive amounts of power in Gensokyo. However, Utsuho completely misunderstands this and interprets this as instructions to decimate Gensokyo's surface. She begins testing out her newfound powers from consuming the Yatagarasu, which causes the geysers to shoot up on the surface, causing the evil spirits of Old Hell (Touhou Project). This incites the main protagonists to investigate the cause of these evil spirits appearing on the surface. It is later revealed that the god Utsuho had encountered was Kanako. This means that the Moriya Shine is indeed the root cause of this incident.
The incident of {{iTouhou Seirensen ~ Undefined Fantastic Object}} begins with a strange flying object appearing in Gensokyo. This strange flying object is, in actuality, the Palanquin Ship (Touhou Project). It shot up from beneath the surface of Gensokyo to the skies as a direct result of the geysers that sprang up because of Utsuho. This incident can be proven to be a result of the Moriya Shine by the fact that if Utsuho was not given the Yatagarasu, the geyser that shot the Palanquin Ship up would never have happened. As a result, this incident is a result of the Moriya Shine, further lending credibility to the Moriya Shrine theory.
The incident of {{iTouhou Shinreibyou ~ Ten Desires}} begins when divine spirits suddenly start appearing in Gensokyo. The main protagonists go out to investigate this, with the game's events ensuing. Byakuren Hijiri (Touhou Project) had set up the Myouren Temple on top Toyosatomimi no Miko (Touhou Project)'s Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum (Touhou Project). It is stated in-game that the Myouren Temple was directly hindering Miko's resurrection and that it broke the seal of the mausoleum, keeping the divine spirits from overflowing. What this means is that because Byakuren set up her temple above Miko's mausoleum, it resulted in the seal of the mausoleum being broken and hindering Miko's resurrection, and broke that seal, causing that overflow of divine spirits. This would suggest that if Byakuren hadn't been unsealed during the events of {{iTouhou Seirensen ~ Undefined Fantastic Object}}, this incident would not have happened, as there wouldn't be anything to hinder Miko's resurrection nor cause that disturbance with those divine spirits. Because Byakuren's unsealing is a direct result of the Palanquin Ship being shot up by the geyser created by Utsuho Reiuji, this means this incident can be linked back to the Moriya Shine, thus adding to the credibility of this theory.
<<AsofOctober 2025>>, there are no further incidents in Gensokyo that have happened that can have their root cause traced back to the actions of the Moriya Shrine. The last time this could be done was with {{iTouhou Shinreibyou ~ Ten Desires}}. Ultimately, the Moriya Shine theory is just an expectation formed from a chain of events between {{iTouhou Fuujinroku ~ Mountain of Faith}} to {{iTouhou Shinreibyou ~ Ten Desires}} with no further evidence to add to the credibility of this theory. It became immediately proven false with the release of {{i Touhou Kishinjou ~ Double Dealing Character}}, which had nothing to do with the Moriya Shrine at all. However, with the incident stones of {{iTouhou Kinjoukyou ~ Fossilized Wonders}} a small connection to the incidents can be made in the form of the Yellow Subterranean stone and Shintoism Wind which have been imbued with the power of the incidents seen in {{iTouhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism}} and {{iTouhou Fuujinroku ~ Mountain of Faith}} respectively.</div>
