  <h1>Movement ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortAction type in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/movement laser fight.png(cap=A player exiting a [[roll|roll (Laser Fight)]].img>>{{bMovement}} is a key aspect in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}}, awarding skillful play with increased access to locations and [[experience|experience (Laser Fight)]]. Many simple and advanced actions can be performed based on a variety of circumstances, such as obstacles and speed. Most movement requires [[stamina|stamina (Laser Fight)]] to perform. Movement speed is measured in studs/sec.<<hrSprintinghr>>{{tMain page: [[Sprint ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spSprinting is a basic movement action where speed is increased while holding {{codeShift}}. While sprinting, stamina will slowly be consumed. Sprinting is used to get between places faster or set up other movement actions. The sprinting speed of a player will be impacted by what [[gun|gun (Laser Fight)]] they are holding.<<hrJumpinghr>>{{tMain page: [[Jump ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spA jump is a basic movement action where the player gains vertical momentum and increases their height by pressing {{codeSpace}}. A jump will cost 5 stamina, but if multiple jumps are performed together (known as [[bunnyhopping|bunnyhopping (Laser Fight)]]), each jump during a bunnyhop will only cost 3 stamina. Bunnyhopping also increases a player's overall speed based on the number of jumps performed, with every jump in a bunnyhop boosting the player by 10%. Trying to jump without stamina will only lead to a tiny leap. Jumping can also be used to cancel other actions, such as a [[slide|slide (Laser Fight)]] or a [[wall hang|wall hang (Laser Fight)]].<<hr2Vaultinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Vault ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spWhen jumping over a small obstacle, a vault will be performed instead, giving a horizontal and vertical speed boost.<<hrSliding/divinghr>>{{tMain pages: [[Slide ({{aiLaser Fight}})]] and [[dive ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spA slide/dive is a movement action that can be performed by pressing {{codeF}} while grounded or airborne at a speed of 20 studs/sec or greater. Doing so will generate a large burst of speed in a single direction and allow the player to fit through small gaps. Sliding/diving is pivotal to navigating the battlefield at speed and getting the jump on opponents. Sliding/diving costs 10 stamina and requires the player to have at least 12 stamina.<<hrWall hanginghr>>{{tMain page: [[Wall hang ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spA wall hang is a movement action that is automatically performed whenever a player jumps up to the ledge of a wall. Hanging on a wall will slowly consume stamina, with the player falling when they run out. If the player normally jumps, they perform a [[wall climb|wall climb (Laser Fight)]] and stand on the wall. If the player jumps while sprinting, they will be flung in the air by doing a [[wall launch|wall launch (Laser Fight)]].<<hrWallrunninghr>>{{tMain page: [[Wallrun ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spA wallrun is a movement action that is triggered when a player holds {{codeR}} while airborne moving parallel to a wall (such as jumping while running alongside a wall before holding {{codeR}}). Wallrunning will slowly consume stamina, with the player falling when they run out. During a wallrun, a player can jump to start scaling the wall.<<hrFall breakinghr>>{{tMain page: [[Fall break ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spA fall break is a movement action that can be used to avoid ragdolling from [[fall damage|fall damage (Laser Fight)]] by jumping right before landing on the ground. By doing so, the player can descend from a higher place without penalty. When sliding out of a fall break, a [[roll|roll (Laser Fight)]] will be performed instead.</div>
