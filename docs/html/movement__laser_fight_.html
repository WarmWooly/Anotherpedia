      <h1>Movement (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Movement is a key aspect in Laser Fight (Roblox game), awarding skillful play with increased access to locations and experience (Laser Fight). Many simple and advanced actions can be performed based on a variety of circumstances, such as obstacles and speed. Most movement requires stamina (Laser Fight) to perform. Movement speed is measured in studs/sec.

Main page: Sprint ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>Sprinting is a basic movement action where speed is increased while holding codeShift. While sprinting, stamina will slowly be consumed. Sprinting is used to get between places faster or set up other movement actions. The sprinting speed of a player will be impacted by what gun (Laser Fight) they are holding.

Main page: Jump ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>A jump is a basic movement action where the player gains vertical momentum and increases their height by pressing codeSpace. A jump will cost 5 stamina, but if multiple jumps are performed together (known as bunnyhopping (Laser Fight)), each jump during a bunnyhop will only cost 3 stamina. Bunnyhopping also increases a player's overall speed based on the number of jumps performed, with every jump in a bunnyhop boosting the player by 10%. Trying to jump without stamina will only lead to a tiny leap. Jumping can also be used to cancel other actions, such as a slide (Laser Fight) or a wall hang (Laser Fight).

Main page: Vault ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>When jumping over a small obstacle, a vault will be performed instead, giving a horizontal and vertical speed boost.

Main pages: Slide ({{aiLaser Fight) and dive (aiLaser Fight)}}<br>A slide/dive is a movement action that can be performed by pressing codeF while grounded or airborne at a speed of 20 studs/sec or greater. Doing so will generate a large burst of speed in a single direction and allow the player to fit through small gaps. Sliding/diving is pivotal to navigating the battlefield at speed and getting the jump on opponents. Sliding/diving costs 10 stamina and requires the player to have at least 12 stamina.

Main page: Wall hang ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>A wall hang is a movement action that is automatically performed whenever a player jumps up to the ledge of a wall. Hanging on a wall will slowly consume stamina, with the player falling when they run out. If the player normally jumps, they perform a wall climb (Laser Fight) and stand on the wall. If the player jumps while sprinting, they will be flung in the air by doing a wall launch (Laser Fight).

Main page: Wallrun ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>A wallrun is a movement action that is triggered when a player holds codeR while airborne moving parallel to a wall (such as jumping while running alongside a wall before holding codeR). Wallrunning will slowly consume stamina, with the player falling when they run out. During a wallrun, a player can jump to start scaling the wall.

Main page: Fall break ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>A fall break is a movement action that can be used to avoid ragdolling from fall damage (Laser Fight) by jumping right before landing on the ground. By doing so, the player can descend from a higher place without penalty. When sliding out of a fall break, a roll (Laser Fight) will be performed instead.</div>
