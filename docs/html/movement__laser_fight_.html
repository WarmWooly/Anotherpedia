  <h1>Movement (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bMovement}} is a key aspect in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}}, awarding skillful play with increased access to locations and experience (Laser Fight). Many simple and advanced actions can be performed based on a variety of circumstances, such as obstacles and speed. Most movement requires stamina (Laser Fight) to perform. Movement speed is measured in studs/sec.
{{tMain page: Sprint ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spSprinting is a basic movement action where speed is increased while holding {{codeShift}}. While sprinting, stamina will slowly be consumed. Sprinting is used to get between places faster or set up other movement actions. The sprinting speed of a player will be impacted by what gun (Laser Fight) they are holding.
{{tMain page: Jump ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spA jump is a basic movement action where the player gains vertical momentum and increases their height by pressing {{codeSpace}}. A jump will cost 5 stamina, but if multiple jumps are performed together (known as bunnyhopping (Laser Fight)), each jump during a bunnyhop will only cost 3 stamina. Bunnyhopping also increases a player's overall speed based on the number of jumps performed, with every jump in a bunnyhop boosting the player by 10%. Trying to jump without stamina will only lead to a tiny leap. Jumping can also be used to cancel other actions, such as a slide (Laser Fight) or a wall hang (Laser Fight).
{{tMain page: Vault ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spWhen jumping over a small obstacle, a vault will be performed instead, giving a horizontal and vertical speed boost.
{{tMain pages: Slide ({{aiLaser Fight}}) and dive ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spA slide/dive is a movement action that can be performed by pressing {{codeF}} while grounded or airborne at a speed of 20 studs/sec or greater. Doing so will generate a large burst of speed in a single direction and allow the player to fit through small gaps. Sliding/diving is pivotal to navigating the battlefield at speed and getting the jump on opponents. Sliding/diving costs 10 stamina and requires the player to have at least 12 stamina.
{{tMain page: Wall hang ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spA wall hang is a movement action that is automatically performed whenever a player jumps up to the ledge of a wall. Hanging on a wall will slowly consume stamina, with the player falling when they run out. If the player normally jumps, they perform a wall climb (Laser Fight) and stand on the wall. If the player jumps while sprinting, they will be flung in the air by doing a wall launch (Laser Fight).
{{tMain page: Wallrun ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spA wallrun is a movement action that is triggered when a player holds {{codeR}} while airborne moving parallel to a wall (such as jumping while running alongside a wall before holding {{codeR}}). Wallrunning will slowly consume stamina, with the player falling when they run out. During a wallrun, a player can jump to start scaling the wall.
{{tMain page: Fall break ({{aiLaser Fight}})}}&spA fall break is a movement action that can be used to avoid ragdolling from fall damage (Laser Fight) by jumping right before landing on the ground. By doing so, the player can descend from a higher place without penalty. When sliding out of a fall break, a roll (Laser Fight) will be performed instead.</div>
