The desktop app was never released to the public.&pVarious features of mRPG made it notable and useful as a lightweight VTT, mainly dice rolling and a character management system. Rolling dice was done through a custom-built function system that allowed for any number and size of dice to be rolled, to run function (computer science) on the results, and to display text and emoji outcomes based on programmed criteria. Campaigns could be openly advertised to all users of the app, having filters for the system used, language spoken, the content maturity of the content, and various other aspects. The character system allowed players to chat as their characters and keep track of their stats and inventory (mechanic) on customizable and shareable character sheets. The game master would also have access to chat as a "GM" or as a spontaneously created Non-player character.</div>
