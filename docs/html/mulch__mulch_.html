      <h1>Mulch (Mulch)</h1>

There are two broad categories of mulch: natural and ambiguous. Natural mulch is any mulch that is directly produced by chipping a wooden block or item of a defined wood type, while ambiguous mulch is the result of chipping undefined wood type blocks/items or adding a dye to mulch. The only difference between natural and ambiguous mulch is that ambiguous mulch cannot be crafted back into planks through mulch. The following are all the natural and ambiguous mulches available (a total of 38):<<tableNatural (21)|Ambiguous (17)||Oak Mulch&spSpruce Mulch&spBirch Mulch&spJungle Mulch&spAcacia Mulch&spDark Oak Mulch&spMangrove Mulch&spCherry Mulch&spBamboo Mulch&spCrimson Mulch&spWarped Mulch&spFir Mulchai<<note(content=Mulches in italics are for compatibility with other mods.(text=noteCountnote>>&spRedwood Mulch&spMahogany Mulch&spJacaranda Mulch&spPalm Mulch&spWillow Mulch&spDead Mulch&spMagic Mulch&spUmbran Mulch&spHellbark Mulch|White Mulch&spLight Gray Mulch&spGray Mulch&spBlack Mulch&spBrown Mulch&spRed Mulch&spOrange Mulch&spYellow Mulch&spLime Mulch&spGreen Mulch&spLight Blue Mulch&spCyan Mulch&spBlue Mulch&spPurple Mulch&spMagenta Mulch&spPink Mulch&spAmbiguous Mulchtable>>



All mulches can be crafted by combining 4 of the same type of wood chip in a 2x2 square or by placing 2 of the same mulch slab vertically. Dyeing functions like most vanilla blocks, where eight mulch surround a single dye, converting all the mulch into the dye's color. Mulch to be dyed can be mixed and matched (ex. 4 oak mulch and 4 birch mulch) and dyed mulch can be redyed using this same method. Dyed mulch must be redefined to undye.



Natural mulch can be used to craft back into their respective planks by using a 2x2 square, making 8 planks. For example, 4 oak mulch would craft into 8 oak planks. Mulches for mod compatibility requires the mod the wood type originates from to be crafted into planks.

Mulches can sustain a wide variety of plants, including flowers, saplings, grasses, sugar cane, kelp, crops, mushrooms, and sweet berry bushes. Bamboo cannot sustain on mulch. Sugar cane and crops planted on mulch do not require water to grow. On a random tick, mulch has a 1 in 20 (5%) chance to apply bonemeal to planted saplings/crops.

All mulches, besides Crimson, Warped, and Hellfire, can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 3 items per block.

All mulches can be thrown into a wood chipper to be turned into 4 wood chips of the same type.

All mulches can be thrown into a mulch redefiner to be turned into any natural mulch (and the ambiguous mulch).</div>
