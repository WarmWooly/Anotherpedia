Natural mulch is any mulch that is directly produced by [[chipping|wood chipper (mulch)]] a wooden block or item of a defined wood type, while ambiguous mulch is the result of chipping undefined wood type blocks/items or adding a [[dye|dye (Minecraft)]] to mulch. The only difference between natural and ambiguous mulch is that ambiguous mulch cannot be crafted back into [[planks|planks (Minecraft)]] through mulch. The following are all the natural and ambiguous mulches available (a total of 38):<<table{{bNatural}} (21)|{{bAmbiguous}} (17)||Oak Mulch&spSpruce Mulch&spBirch Mulch&spJungle Mulch&spAcacia Mulch&spDark Oak Mulch&spMangrove Mulch&spCherry Mulch&spBamboo Mulch&spCrimson Mulch&spWarped Mulch&sp{{iFir Mulch{{ai<<note(content=Mulches in italics are for compatibility with other mods.(text=noteCountnote>>}}&spRedwood Mulch&spMahogany Mulch&spJacaranda Mulch&spPalm Mulch&spWillow Mulch&spDead Mulch&spMagic Mulch&spUmbran Mulch&spHellbark Mulch}}|White Mulch&spLight Gray Mulch&spGray Mulch&spBlack Mulch&spBrown Mulch&spRed Mulch&spOrange Mulch&spYellow Mulch&spLime Mulch&spGreen Mulch&spLight Blue Mulch&spCyan Mulch&spBlue Mulch&spPurple Mulch&spMagenta Mulch&spPink Mulch&spAmbiguous Mulchtable>><<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>All mulches can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]] by combining 4 of the same type of [[wood chip|wood chips (mulch)]] in a 2x2 square or by placing 2 of the same [[mulch slab|mulch slabs (Mulch)]] vertically. Dyeing functions like most vanilla blocks, where eight mulch surround a single dye, converting all the mulch into the dye's color. Mulch to be dyed can be mixed and matched (ex. 4 oak mulch and 4 birch mulch) and dyed mulch can be redyed using this same method. Dyed mulch must be [[redefined|mulch redefiner (Mulch)]] to undye.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>Natural mulch can be used to craft back into their respective planks by using a 2x2 square, making 8 [[planks|planks (Minecraft)]]. For example, 4 oak mulch would craft into 8 [[oak planks|oak planks (Minecraft)]]. Mulches for [[mod compatibility|Mulch mod compatibility]] requires the mod the wood type originates from to be crafted into planks.<<hr2Farminghr2>>Mulches can sustain a wide variety of [[plants|plants (Minecraft)]], including [[flowers|flowers (Minecraft)]], [[saplings|sapling (Minecraft)]], [[grasses|grasses (Minecraft)]], [[sugar cane|sugar cane (Minecraft)]], [[kelp|kelp (Minecraft)]], [[crops|crops (Minecraft)]], [[mushrooms|mushrooms (Minecraft)]], and [[sweet berry bushes|sweet berry bush (Minecraft)]]. [[Bamboo|Bamboo (Minecraft)]] cannot sustain on mulch. Sugar cane and crops planted on mulch do not require water to grow. On a [[random tick|random tick (Minecraft)]], mulch has a 1 in 20 (5%) chance to apply [[bonemeal|bonemeal (Minecraft)]] to planted saplings/crops.<<hr2Fuelhr2>>All mulches, besides Crimson, Warped, and Hellfire, can be used as [[fuel|fuel (Minecraft)]] in a [[furnace|furnace (Minecraft)]], smelting 3 items per block.<<hr2Chippinghr2>>All mulches can be thrown into a [[wood chipper|wood chipper (Mulch)]] to be turned into 4 [[wood chips|wood chips (Mulch)]] of the same type.<<hr2Redefininghr2>>All mulches can be thrown into a [[mulch redefiner|mulch redefiner (mulch)]] to be turned into any natural mulch (and the ambiguous mulch).</div>
