To crafting (Minecraft) a wood chipper, the recipe requires 4 iron ingot (Minecraft), 1 spyglass (Minecraft), and 1 hopper (Minecraft) (place the spyglass in the middle, then the hopper in one of the bottom corners; fill the rest of the bottom two rows with iron).
Wood chips or mulch thrown into the top of a wood chipper will be turned into the type as defined in the mulch redefiner's interface (Oak by default). The wood chips/mulch can be converted into any non-dyed variation. The resulting materials will then be spat out in the direction the spout is facing on the mulch redefiner. There is no limit to how many items can be redefined at a time.</div>
