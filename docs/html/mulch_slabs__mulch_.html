All mulch slabs can be crafted by combining of the same type of wood chip in a 2-wide line or by placing 3 of the same mulch in a 3-wide line (makes 6).



2 of the same mulch slabs can be placed in a vertical line to be recombined into mulch of the same type.

All mulch slabs, besides Crimson, Warped, and Hellfire, can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 1.5 items per block.

All mulch slabs can be thrown into a wood chipper to be turned into 2 wood chips of the same type.

All mulch slabs can be thrown into a mulch redefiner to be turned into all non-dyed mulch slabs.</div>
