      <h1>My Superhero Movie</h1>
      <div>"My Superhero Movie" is a song from the 2018 film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies played by Jacob Jeffries Band, with Jacob Jeffries singing the song as Robin. The song in the movie conveys Robin's desire to star in his own movie, where he would be able to rake in the spotlight and audience attention while also highlighting Robin's egotistical tendencies. The meme It would be so awesome, it would be so cool originates from the first lyric of "My Superhero Movie".
