      <h1>Nagasaki x Ampharos</h1>
      <div>Nagasaki x Ampharos is a part of the Pokémon Local Acts in and Nagasaki Prefecture Nagasaki of the Pokémon (fictional species) Ampharos, labeled the "Nagasaki Future Support Pokémon", appointed on June 28, 2024. This destination marketing stunt involves a mascot of an Ampharos, various Ampharos-decorated food and souvenir, "Poké Lid" (decorated manhole cover) including the Pokémon, and themed public transport. The tram is operated by Nagasaki Electric Tramway, while the bus is operated by Saihi Motor. The selection of Ampharos was due to the numerous lighthouse within the Nagasaki Prefecture, which matches how Ampharos' tail bulb can be seen from miles on sea for guidence.

The mascot for Nagasaki x Ampharos is a human-proportioned Ampharos. The costume features a large, rounded body, flipper hands, legs and feet, a head with horns, eyes, and a head bulb, and a tail with a bulb at the end. The bulbs do not glow, and the neck is much shorter compared to the Pokémon. The costume can also have an attached ribbon badge that depicts a lighthouse, water and land, a flower, and the text lines "デンリュウ" (Ampharos) and "ながさき未来応援ポケモン" (Nagasaki Future Support Pokémon).</div>
