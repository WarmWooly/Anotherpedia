  <h1>Natural Leather Padding (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div><<info||{{bStats}}||{{bRarity (Minecraft)}}|Common||{{bStack size (Minecraft)}}|64||{{bFire-resistant item (Minecraft)}}|Noinfo>>{{bNatural leather padding}} is an item (Minecraft) in the {{iMinecraft}} mod (Minecraft) {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}} as an upgrade to the leather padding (Not Lazy Chainmail). Natural leather padding is used to upgrade chainmail armor (Not Lazy Chainmail) or shield (Minecraft) in a leathersmithing table (Not Lazy Chainmail), giving +1 Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis will cause applied items to slowly regain durability (Minecraft) in the daytime (Minecraft) while the sky is visible.
Natural leather padding can be melded in a Melder (Not Lazy Chainmail) using 1 leather padding (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 loose stone (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 1 moss block (Minecraft).
In a leathersmithing table (Not Lazy Chainmail), natural leather padding can be applied to chainmail armor (Not Lazy Chainmail) or shield (Minecraft). Each natural leather padding adds +1 Photosynthesis, with a max of +3 Photosynthesis per item. Shields will only gain the benefits of Photosynthesis when held in the main hand (Minecraft) or offhand (Minecraft).
Every tick (Minecraft) the sky is directly above the player (Minecraft) during the daytime (Minecraft), there is an {{ix}}{{s-b/200}} chance for a durability (Minecraft) point to be restored, where {{ix}} = Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis only works on the applied item.</div>
