  <h1>Natural number</h1>
  <div>A {{bnatural number}} is a whole number which is positive number. It comes from how natural counting consists of whole elements, such as a log or an apple. It does not consider the fraction of an object, quantifying elements into the simplest numeric form. Natural numbers may or may not include 0, as there isn't a physical way to representation nothing, but it is a whole number. Natural numbers include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. The set (mathematics) of all natural numbers is denoted with bold (typography) {{bN}} or blackboard bold &bbN. The set of natural numbers is a subset of integer &bbZ.</div>
