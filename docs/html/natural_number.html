      <h1>Natural number</h1>
      <div>A natural number is a whole number which is positive. It comes from how natural counting consists of whole elements, such as a log or an apple. It does not consider the fraction of an object, quantifying elements into the simplest numeric form. Natural numbers may or may not include 0, as there isn't a physical way to represent nothing, but it is a whole number. Natural numbers include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. The set of all natural numbers is denoted with bold N or blackboard bold &bbN. The set of natural numbers is a subset of integers &bbZ.</div>
