      <h1>Nature Dungeon (Blue Skies)</h1>
      <div>The nature dungeon is a massive structure (Minecraft) within the Minecraft modding (Minecraft) Blue Skies (Minecraft mod) in the Everbright (Blue Skies) dimension (Minecraft) Snow Covered Pines (Blue Skies) biome (Minecraft). The structure is comprised of 5 layers primarily made out of Nature Stone (Blue Skies)-based blocks. When trying to enter the nature dungeon before defeating the Summoner (Blue Skies) in the Blinding Tower (Blue Skies), the effect (Minecraft) Poison (Minecraft) II, Blindness (Minecraft), and Slowness (Minecraft) II will be applied with the message "Looks like I'm not able to progress here yet." When trying to break non-Monster Spawner blocks before defeating the Starlit Crusher (Blue Skies), the message "You can't do that here right now." will appear, and the block will be replaced. The boss room will instead have the message  "You can't do that in this room." and block breaking will always be prevented, regardless of whether the boss is killed. When entering a nature dungeon for the first time, the advancement (Minecraft) Heart of Nature (Blue Skies) will be awarded.



The bottom level of the nature dungeon is comprised of 25 rooms in a 5x5 grid, all randomly connected by hallways. Most rooms have Monster Spawner (Minecraft) spawning Stonelet (Blue Skies) and/or Starlit Chest (Blue Skies) containing loot. There is also a room with a staircase to the next level. Each room is up to 18x18x9 in size, with 11 blocks between each room. One of the chests will contain one of the four Nature Dungeon Key (Blue Skies) needed to fight the Starlit Crusher (Blue Skies).

The second level of the nature dungeon is comprised of 25 rooms in a 5x5 grid with random hallways, similar to the level below. The structures within the rooms are more complex and, on average, contain more Monster Spawners. The same staircase is used to get to the next level. Rooms are up to 18x18x9 in size, with 9 blocks between each room. One of the chests will contain the second Nature Dungeon Key.

The third level of the nature dungeon is comprised of 25 rooms in a 5x5 grid with random hallways again, with more chests and open space. The same staircase is used to get to the next level. Rooms are up to 16x16x9 in size, with 12 blocks between each room. One of the chests will contain the third Nature Dungeon Key.

The fourth level of the nature dungeon is comprised of 25 rooms in a 5x5 grid with random hallways again, containing the most complex rooms in the dungeon. The same staircase is used to get to the next level. Rooms are up to 16x16x9 in size, with 8 blocks between each room. One of the chests will contain the final Nature Dungeon Key.

The top level of the nature dungeon is comprised of 2 rooms, the staircase and the boss room. Midnight Glass (Blue Skies) is used as windows to the roof containing Comet Grass (Blue Skies) and Comet Tree (Blue Skies). The staircase room is 17x16x9 in size, while the boss room is 29x29x14 in size with a dome roof. While the boss room seems to have an opening on the top, Barrier (Minecraft) close the hole. A 23x5x7 hallway connects the rooms, with a Nature Keystone (Blue Skies) blocking access to the boss room. Entering the boss room in an unintended way will not spawn the Starlit Crusher (Blue Skies). When trying to open the Nature Keystone without 4 Nature Dungeon Keys, the message "You need 4 dungeon keys to enter." will appear. The trade for Nature Dungeon Keys will also become available from the Gatekeeper (Blue Skies). When using the keys on the Nature Keystone, all nearby player (Minecraft) will be teleported into the boss room, and the Starlit Crusher will spawn in the center of the room.

The following can be found in chests in the nature dungeon:<br>Brewberry (Blue Skies), Pink Brewberry (Blue Skies), Black Brewberry (Blue Skies)<br>Nature Stone (Blue Skies), Glowing Nature Stone (Blue Skies)<br>Starlit Sapling (Blue Skies), Blush Blossom (Blue Skies)<br>Pyrope Gemstone (Blue Skies), Aquite (Blue Skies), Diopside Gemstone (Blue Skies)<br>Starlit Spear (Blue Skies), Aquite Axe (Blue Skies)<br>Saddle (Minecraft)<br>Nature Dungeon Key (Blue Skies) (1 per level)</div>
