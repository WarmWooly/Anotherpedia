      <h1>Neckerchief</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with bandana.<br>A neckerchief is an article of clothing worn around the neck. It is often used for ceremonial purposes. They have a standard size of 27 inches.

A neckerchief is often associated with BSA and other relevant programs. A neckerchief's design is based on each troop and is not required on the official uniform. These neckerchiefs are able to be used as a triangular bandage in emergency situations, and Scouts are taught how to use them for injuries such as broken bones and burns.</div>
