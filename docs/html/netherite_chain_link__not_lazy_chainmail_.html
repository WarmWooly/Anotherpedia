      <h1>Netherite Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|Yesinfo>>The netherite chain link is an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used in maille crafting.
Netherite chain links can be snipped using pliers from a netherite coil or an unfinished netherite project. While unfinished projects may be variable in size, coils always contain 64 chain links.
Netherite chain links can be obtained when a Crusher crushes a netherite chain (makes 8 chain links).
Netherite chain links can be used with a chainmail project to maille craft the following items:&spMusic Disc "Boss" - 32 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chain - 8 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Belt - 128 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Boots - 256 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Bracelet - 64 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Chestplate - 512 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Gloves - 192 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Helmet - 320 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Industrial Belt - 256 netherite chain links&spNetherite Chainmail Leggings - 448 netherite chain link&spNetherite Chainmail Necklace - 128 netherite chain links&spNetherite Tool Chain - 192 netherite chain links
In a Recycler, 27 netherite chain links can be recycled into a netherite fragment.
Netherite chainmail armor enchanted with Chain Repair will automatically take a netherite chain link from the inventory to repair durability when the wearer takes damage. Chain Repair can go up to IV, adding 2, 4, 8, and 12 durability per chain link consumed for levels I-IV respectively. The chain link will only be consumed when the maximum value of the chain link can be repaired.
Netherite chain links can be converted into Forge Energy in a chain generator. Using an iron composite chainmail industrial belt constantly fed with netherite chain links, 200 FE/t can be generated.
