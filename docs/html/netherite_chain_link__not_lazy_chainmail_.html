  <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Yesinfo>>The netherite chain link is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used in maille crafting.
Netherite chain links can be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) using pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) from a netherite coil (Not Lazy Chainmail) or an unfinished netherite project (Not Lazy Chainmail). While unfinished projects may be variable in size, coils always contain 64 chain links.
Netherite chain links can be obtained when a Crusher (Not Lazy Chainmail) crushes a netherite chain (Not Lazy Chainmail) (makes 8 chain links).

netherite chainmail armor (Not Lazy Chainmail) enchanted with Chain Repair (Not Lazy Chainmail) will automatically take a netherite chain link from the inventory (Minecraft) to repair durability (Minecraft) when the wearer takes damage. Chain Repair can go up to IV, adding 2, 4, 8, and 12 durability per chain link consumed for levels I-IV respectively. The chain link will only be consumed when the maximum value of the chain link can be repaired.
Netherite chain links can be converted into Forge Energy (Minecraft modding) in a Chain Generator (Not Lazy Chainmail). Using an iron composite chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) constantly fed with netherite chain links, 200 FE/tick (Minecraft) can be generated.
