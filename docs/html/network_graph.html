  <h1>Network graph</h1>
  <div>A network graph, also known as a network diagram or network chart, is a graph that shows connection between data. A network graph is composed of node and line or arrow which show the relationship between two data points. Many network graphs change the size of the nodes to be larger with more connections and smaller with fewer.</div>
