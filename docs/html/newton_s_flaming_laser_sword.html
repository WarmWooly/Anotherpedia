  <h1>Newton's flaming laser sword</h1>
  <div><<shortPowerful philosophical razor by Mike Aldershort>>{{tFor the [[song]], see [[Newton's Flaming Laser Sword (song)]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/newtons flaming laser sword.jpg(cap=[[Artwork|art]] depicting [[Issac Newton]] holding a flaming laser sword.img>>{{bNewton's flaming laser sword}}, also known as {{bAlder's razor}}, describes a [[philosophical razor]] created by [[Mike Alder]] in [[Philosophy Now]]. The razor is closely related to [[Newtonianism]]. It is titled {{iflaming laser sword}} to describe how it is sharper than [[Occam's razor]]. The full [[quote]] for it is the following:<<quoIn its weakest form it says that we should not dispute propositions unless they can be shown by precise [[logic]] and/or [[mathematics]] to have observable consequences. In its strongest form it demands a [[list]] of [[observable|observation]] consequences and a formal demonstration that they are indeed consequences of the proposition [[claimed|claim]].quo>>It is often boiled down to this:<<quoIf a question cannot be answered through experiment, it is not worth asking.quo>>The razor removes [[impossible]] [[questions|question]] that are not worth [[debating|debate]]. This includes questions such as "If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it make a sound?", because there is no way to observe it, making it [[useless]] to talk about.</div>
