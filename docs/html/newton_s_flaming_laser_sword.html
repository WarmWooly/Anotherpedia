      <h1>Newton's flaming laser sword</h1>
      <div>For the song, see Newton's Flaming Laser Sword (song).<br>Newton's flaming laser sword, also known as Alder's razor, describes a philosophical razor created by Mike Alder in Philosophy Now. The razor is closely related to Newtonianism. It is titled flaming laser sword to describe how it is sharper than Occam's razor. The full quote for it is the following:In its weakest form it says that we should not dispute propositions unless they can be shown by precise logic and/or mathematics to have observable consequences. In its strongest form it demands a list of observable consequences and a formal demonstration that they are indeed consequences of the proposition claimed.It is often boiled down to this:If a question cannot be answered through experiment, it is not worth asking.The razor removes impossible questions that are not worth debating. This includes questions such as "If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it make a sound?", because there is no way to observe it, making it useless to talk about.</div>
