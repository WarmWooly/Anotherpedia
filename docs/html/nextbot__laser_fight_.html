  <h1>Nextbot (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>{{bNextbot}} is a kill streak (Laser Fight) in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}} that allows a player to summon a bot that will run around the map and kill opponents. Placing a Nextbot requires the player to be facing an open space. Nextbots will go towards the nearest opponent, and on contact, will kill them. Nextbots can't be killed, but they will despawn over time. Nextbots will have a random image when spawned in.<<table{{bLevel}}|{{bSkill Points}}|{{bKill Points}}|{{bEffect}}||{{rLvl. 1}}|{{r-}}|{{r19}}|10 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 2}}|{{r4}}|{{r20}}|15 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 3}}|{{r5}}|{{r21}}|20 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 4}}|{{r5}}|{{r22}}|25 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 5}}|{{r6}}|{{r24}}|35 sec lifespantable>>
