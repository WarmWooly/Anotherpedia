      <h1>Nibble (computing)</h1>
      <div>A nibble or nybble is a unit of information comprised of four bits, being half a byte (with the name being a play on having a nibble instead of a full bite). A nibble can hold up to sixteen values (2s-u4), with one nibble having enough space for a single digit in hexadecimal or a binary-coded decimal.</div>
