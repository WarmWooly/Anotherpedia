      <h1>Ninjew (God's Gang)</h1>
      <div>Ninjew (also written as NinJew) is a fictional character, being a member of God's Gang in the show God's Gang. He represents Judaism, having completed Hebrew school and having gone through his Bar Mitzvah by the start of the show. He is seen wearing a pair of glasses, a kippah, a pair of amber shoes, pants, and a brown bekishe over a white undershirt. He is considered "short", being a major plot point for the premier. He is voiced by Ross Allan.

As described in the opening song (...While Ninjew is over-analyzing...), Ninjew uses intellect and observation to try and find solutions to problems that the gang runs into. He has an "Ana-Laser Mode", where he converts his kippah into a hoiche hat and his glasses turn green. He is able to leap dozens of feet into the air while in combat. He can use prayer alongside his gang members to enhance the abilities of another.</div>
