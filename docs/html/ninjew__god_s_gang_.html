  <h1>Ninjew (God's Gang)</h1>
  <div>{{bNinjew}} (also written as {{bNinJew}}) is a fictional character, being a member of God's Gang (God's Gang) in the show {{iGod's Gang}}. He represents Judaism, having completed Hebrew school and having gone through his Bar Mitzvah by the start of the show. He is seen wearing a pair of glasses, a kippah, a pair of amber shoe, pants, and a brown bekishe over a white undershirt. He is considered "short", being a major plot point for the Love Is In The Airhole (God's Gang). He is voice acting by Ross Allan.
As described in the opening song ({{i...While Ninjew is over-analyzing...}}), Ninjew uses intelligence and observation to try and find solutions to problems that the gang runs into. He has an "Ana-Laser Mode", where he converts his kippah into a hoiche hat and his glasses turn green. He is able to leap dozens of foot (unit) into the air while in combat. He can use Jewish prayer alongside his gang members to enhance the abilities of another.</div>
