      <h1>No Nut November</h1>
      <div>No Nut November (NNN) is an annual internet challenge where men abstain from masturbation for the entirety of November. The challenge originated in the early 2010s, before slowly growing in popularity. The challenge is often represented with a no symbol over a peanut. Other challenges, such as No Shave November, take the concept in a less taboo direction. NNN does not have major benefits or costs to participants compared to those who do not participate. The rules for the challenge are variable, with some participants only banning ejaculation, while others rule out all sex. The subreddit r/nonutnovember is a popular Reddit community for the challenge.</div>
