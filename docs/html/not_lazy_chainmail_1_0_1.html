      <h1>Not Lazy Chainmail 1.0.1</h1>
      <div>{{iNot Lazy Chainmail 1.0.1}} was a minor update to the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail released on July 25th, 2024, which fixed minor bugs and reduced the file size from 23.6 MB to 12.5 MB. The majority of the file size reductions were from compressing audio files, mainly those for the oxide dust. This update comes two days after its release, and is preceded by 1.0.2.</div>
