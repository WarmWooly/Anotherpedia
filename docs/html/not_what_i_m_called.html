      <h1>Not what I'm called</h1>
      <div>Not what I'm called is a meme of calling someone or something by a similar, but incorrect, word or phrase, originating from Tumblr on June 7, 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://possessable.tumblr.com/post/752670695864074240(text=refCountref>> The original post depicts Polyphemus from Homer's Odyssey saying "hey guys" to two other characters, with one of them shouting "POLYAMOROUS". Polyphemus retorts by yelling, "NOT WHAT I'M CALLED". The humor comes from how far the incorrect term is compared to the name of the character (such as Polyphemus, the character, and polyamorous, the term for romance with multiple partners). Variations include other characters/objects that start with the term poly-, other misnames (such as Austin Powers being called "Autism Powers"), and other misnomers (such as Link being called Zelda).</div>
