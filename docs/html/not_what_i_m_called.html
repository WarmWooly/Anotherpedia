  <h1>Not what I'm called</h1>
  <div><<shortMeme of calling someone by the wrong termshort>><<img(src=git/not what I'm called.png(cap=The original meme from Tumblr.img>>{{bNot what I'm called}} is a [[meme|internet meme]] of calling someone or something by a similar, but incorrect, word or phrase, originating from [[Tumblr]] on June 7, 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://possessable.tumblr.com/post/752670695864074240(text=refCountref>> The original post depicts [[Polyphemus]] from [[Homer's|Homer]] {{i[[Odyssey]]}} saying "hey guys" to two other characters, with one of them shouting "[[POLYAMOROUS]]". Polyphemus retorts by yelling, "NOT WHAT I'M CALLED". The [[humor]] comes from how far the incorrect term is compared to the name of the character (such as {{iPoly}}phemus, the [[character]], and {{ipoly}}amorous, the term for [[romance]] with multiple partners). Variations include other characters/objects that start with the term [[poly-]], other misnames (such as [[Austin Powers]] being called "[[Autism]] Powers"), and other [[misnomers|misnomer]] (such as [[Link|Link (The Legend of Zelda)]] being called [[Zelda|Zelda (The Legend of Zelda)]]).</div>
