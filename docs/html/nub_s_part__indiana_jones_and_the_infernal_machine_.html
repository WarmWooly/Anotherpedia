      <h1>Nub's Part (Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine)</h1>
      <div>Nub's Part is a part of the Infernal Machine. This machine part is found by the fictional archeologist Indiana Jones in 1947 during the events of the game Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine.

This artifact is found under the pyramids of Meroë in Sudan during the level "Nub's Tomb". This machine part is used to power up certain mechanisms inside the level by using it while standing next to specific ports. Nub's Part is first found after completing a puzzle to get a metal ball located up above to stop zapping living entities in the room it is located in, such as Soviet soldiers and the player. After Nub's Part is obtained, this ball loses power and no longer hurts any living entities.

Nub's Part was taken by the disciple Nub as he fled to Sudan after the Infernal Machine was first attempted to be destroyed by the Babylonians. Nub's tomb is located in Meroë, Sudan, underneath the pyramids and through König Salomons Grube using an elevator to take you deeper down and into the tomb, which can be revealed by placing 3 specific colored jewels inside the eye sockets of spots depicting the Eye of Horus. This machine part acts as the battery for the Infernal Machine and is used to power various ancient machinery. Despite being of a primitive time, Nub's Part is on par with, if not outright exceeds, the power capacity of modern power generation. It is also shown that the Infernal Machine can operate in some capacity without Nub's Part present or in its correct spot, but it is implied to be required for the Infernal Machine to properly function as it was intended to by Marduk. This machine part was lost after the Infernal Machine self-destructed during Indiana Jones's adventure in 1947.</div>
