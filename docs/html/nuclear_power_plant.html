      <h1>Nuclear power plant</h1>
      <div>A nuclear power plant is a power generation facility that uses steam to spin turbines from boiling water using heat generated from nuclear fission. Nuclear reactors are not the same as nuclear power plants. A nuclear reactor is the device that controls nuclear fission, while a nuclear power plant is the building that uses the heat from a nuclear reactor to boil water.<br><br><<AsofApril 2024>>, there are 54 nuclear power plants in the USA. The worst failure of a nuclear power plant was at Chernobyl. The most recent failure was at Fukushima.</div>
