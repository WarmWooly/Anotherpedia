Life is a drag, life is a chore&spFrightfully sad, so mindless a bore&spMice in a bag, you fight and you gnaw&spFor the rights just to brag in line for the door&spThe higher your score, the louder you bicker&spLife give you lemons? Good heavens! You're bitter&spAnd whatever you get to collect, well, that head interjects&spWith incessant effect, "Could be bigger!"&pHere comes the next utter wreck&spWhat the heck? Cut the deck&spUnsuspectingly betting their dinner&spWhen left unchecked, cuts a check&spBust, the rest rubberneck&spBut expect still to end up a winner&pIf you're ever in the dumps or feeling stuck in a rut&spYou simply haven't had the fun of watching number go up&spYou know, it's wonderful stuff, let the hundreds runneth over your cup&spIt's such a buzz to watch the number go up&spYou must be pretty dumb for thinking some is enough&spWhen you can add another one and make the number go up&spUntil you run out of luck and find your funds are down to nothing but fluff&spNo runners-up in making number go up&pThat day-to-day is unbearably dry&spMakes sense to chase that numerical high&spBe it a salary, calories, boxes on ballot sheets&spWhoops! Don't forget to subscribe! (Don't forget to subscribe)&spAre you feeling alive with catharsis or pride?&spMaybe father has cried? Have you asked yourself why?&spTo blast through a ceiling might pass for appealing&spBut chance is you're leaving with plaster in eyes&spAnd the faster the rise, the harder the fall&spInfinite jester still get curtain calls&spMy God, it's historic, meteoric! Alas, my poor Yorick&spHe held his head high through it all&pIf you're ever in the dumps or feeling stuck in a rut&spYou simply haven't had the fun of watching number go up&spIf your budget is bust, you gotta trust the funds are gonna erupt&spYou gotta lust for making number go up (Ha ha, sing, you fools!)&spYou must be pretty dumb for thinking some is enough&spWhen you can add another one and make the number go up&spBut all the lustre can rust. Sweep your dreams into a dustpan and brush&spAnother shmuck to make the numbers go up&pShoot like a star or fold like a quitter&spSomebody once told me about all that glitters&spNow, you might dream of queens, straight flush with the greens&spBut get jack when you're sold down the river&spYou might find you're an ace or just bluff from the start&spHave diamonds in spades or get clubbed in the heart&spWhen the pots have an end and the flop doesn't send&spYou a handful of lovely cards&spThe world's at the table, it's prudent to play&spTo err, says the fable, is human, but hey&spWatch your stack, for the fact is that affluence turning to crap&spIs one little vowel movement away&pThose rags-to-riches you got from that tip-off&spJust tacking stiches to viciously rip off&spBet on a dream it seems it might tear at the seams&spWhy'd you think so much poker is strip-off?&spNow let's see who's next in line to proclaim&spThey can be king just by making it reign&spA million monarchs competing for dwindling court seating&spAll blind how fleeting their fame&spThe ante is up and the cards are face-down&spSadly, it can't be be the other way 'round&spBut the biggest of figures won't impress the digger&spWhen picking your hole in the ground (Oh, now you're in the hole; Hahahahahaha)&pIf you're ever in the dumps or feeling stuck in a rut&spYou simply haven't had the fun of watching number go up&spOh, it's a punch in the nuts. Stuck in a puddle with the wrong kind of flush&spGet off your butt and make the number go up (Muhahaha, yes!)&spYou must be pretty dumb for thinking some is enough&spWhen you can add another one and make the number go up (So I can hear you at the buffet tables!)&spUntil it crumbles to dust. Another puppet for the vultures to pluck&spOutta luck making number go up&spYeah, we'd really like to make another couple of bucks&spSo won't you play this song again and make the number go up?</div>
