The number flips on the y-axis repeatedly.&sp772: The number is green with the same outline. The number bounces in a choppy arc from left to right.&sp773: The number is pink with the same outline, but with more defined curves and sharper angles. The number rotates between two different angles.&sp774: The number is red with a thin, black outline. The number flips on both the x- and y-axis repeatedly.&sp775: The number is pink with a thick, black outline, keeping true to the title (775 is pink). The "5" in 775 rapidly grows and shrinks.&sp776: The number is blue with the same outline. The number is split in the middle with a noticeable gap before merging over and over.&sp777: The number is white with the same outline, adorned with angel wing on either side and a yellow halo above the middle "7". The number bounces up and down.&sp778: The number is orange with the same outline. The number is scaled on the x-axis, repeatedly flattening the number.&sp779: The number is cyan with a sharper outline and a thinner line stroke. The number is sliding left to right.&sp780: The number is a darker blue with a larger, rounded size and thickness. The number rotates between two different angles.</div>
