  <h1>Numeron Dragon (Yu-Gi-Oh!)</h1>
  <div>This page is for the character, history, and legend surrounding the Numeron Dragon. For the card, see Number 100: Numeron Dragon.&spNumeron Dragon is a character appearing in Yu-Gi-Oh!. It is the creation of the universe and the Numeron Code (Yu-Gi-Oh!). Numeron Dragon is a large dragon resembling a Chinese dragon. It was eventually reborn as a Number Monster and played a huge role in the final fight against Don Thousand (Yu-Gi-Oh!) as it directly resulted in the destruction of Number C1000: Numerounius and played a crucial role in boosting the attack points of Number 39: Utopia to allow it to beat over the 100000 Attack (Yu-Gi-Oh!) of Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia.&sp
The first bit of lore revealed about Numeron Dragon comes from the 133rd episode of Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL. In that episode, it was revealed that the Numeron Dragon was the first being to exist. As the first being in existence, Numeron Dragon got lonely, and so it used its power to create the universe. However, doing so drained it of almost all of its power and nearly killed it. Wanting to see the future of its creation, Numeron Dragon shed one singular tear. That tear had traveled throughout the cosmos and eventually impacted the Earth, and from that impact formed the Moon. That impact also buried the Numeron Code on Earth. The tear that impacted the Earth contained all the knowledge and emotions of itself. Numeron Dragon then used the power of the Numbers to hide away the existence of the Numeron Code. Lastly, Numeron Dragon left a record detailing the location of the key to the Numeron Code, after which, Numeron Dragon vanished.&sp
In episode 134 of the Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL anime, Numeron Dragon was reborn as Number 100: Numeron Dragon. During Kaito Tenjo (Yu-Gi-Oh!) and Mizael (Yu-Gi-Oh!)'s duel on the Moon, the conditions specified in the Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time (Yu-Gi-Oh!) were met. Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon, Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon, and Number 46: Dragluon resonated together, and summoned Numeron Dragon from the Moon. Numeron Dragon was reborn as Number 100: Numeron Dragon. As Kaito was dying, he entrusted Number 100: Numeron Dragon to Mizael.</div>
