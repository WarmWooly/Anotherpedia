  <h1>Nutmeg (soccer)</h1>
  <div>A {{bnutmeg}}, or {{bmeg}}, in soccer (association football), and occasionally in other sport, is a term for when a soccer ball or other object is pass (soccer) between another player's legs. The main advantage of performing a nutmeg is circumventing the need to go around or over an opponent, saving time and space in close-quarter situations. This dribbling (soccer) skill is not only beneficial when pulled off, but also seen as very impressive. Failing a nutmeg, however, can allow the opponent to take control of the ball and break free.</div>
