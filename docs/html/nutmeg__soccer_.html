      <h1>Nutmeg (soccer)</h1>
      <div>A nutmeg, or meg, in soccer (association football), and occasionally in other sports, is a term for when a soccer ball or other object is passed between another player's legs. The main advantage of performing a nutmeg is circumventing the need to go around or over an opponent, saving time and space in close-quarter situations. This dribbling skill is not only beneficial when pulled off, but also seen as very impressive. Failing a nutmeg, however, can allow the opponent to take control of the ball and break free.</div>
