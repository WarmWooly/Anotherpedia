      <h1>Oat milk</h1>
      <div>Oat milk is a type of plant milk made from oat by filtering out the oat's materials into water. Oat milk is white in appearance, sharing a high visual similarity between that and cow milk. Still, it may also appear slightly brown depending on the filtration process and the number of oats.</div>
