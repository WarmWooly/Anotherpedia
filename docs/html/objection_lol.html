      <h1>Objection.LOL</h1>
      <div>Objection.LOL is a website that allows users to create a scene based on the Ace Attorney series utilizing characters and mechanics as present within the games, which can be found at <<link(src=https://objection.lol/(text=objection.lollink>>. Objection.LOL was created in 2019 by HappySylveon. Objection.LOL has since spurred a fanbase of its own, separate from the Ace Attorney series, used for comedy or as a medium for serious discussions. The ability to add custom assets into scenes greatly expands the scope of what can be done within the website, adding new characters and interactions outside of Ace Attorney. The fanbase includes a Fandom wiki and many dedicated YouTubers making tutorials and videos utilizing Objection.LOL.</div>
