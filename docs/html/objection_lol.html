  <h1>Objection.LOL</h1>
  <div>{{bObjection.LOL}} is a website that allows users to create a scene based on the {{iAce Attorney}} series utilizing Ace Attorney characters and game mechanic as present within the games, which can be found at <<link(src=https://objection.lol/(text=objection.lollink>>. Objection.LOL was created in 2019 by HappySylveon. Objection.LOL has since spurred a fanbase of its own, separate from the {{iAce Attorney}} series, used for comedy or as a medium for serious discussions. The ability to add custom assets into scenes greatly expands the scope of what can be done within the website, adding new character and interactions outside of {{iAce Attorney}}. The fanbase includes a Fandom (website) Objection.lol Wiki and many dedicated Objection.LOL on YouTube making tutorial and video utilizing Objection.LOL.</div>
