      <div>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a regulatory agency under the United States Department of Labor lead by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health Douglas L. Parker <<asofJuly 2024>>. OSHA was created after President Richard Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act by the United States Congress on December 29, 1970.
