      <h1>Office (Generated) (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Office (Generated) is a tiny indoor VIP map in Laser Fight based on office buildings, being a variation of the map Office. Players spawn on the bottom floor of the map. An elevator with up and down controls can be used to quickly get between the eight floors and the roof, with a staircase along the side for manual access. The bottom level is a reception room, with the top room being the boss's office. The floors in the middle are filled with cubicals with various generated objects. Unlike other maps, guns will spawn across all the floors of the office building. The glass windows can be shattered by bullets, and the computers can be used and destroyed.

The void covering the bottom of the map is lethal, killing players on contact. The badge Long Way Down is awarded through dying this way. The death screen will say, "The Void killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X fell out of the world|X had a long way down|X was consumed by the void|X was lost in the abyss|X went missing|X fell into the river of Lego City|X wasn't rescued by Lakitu|X plunged into the darkness;;</div>
