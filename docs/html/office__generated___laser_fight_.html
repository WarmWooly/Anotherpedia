Players spawn on the bottom floor of the map. An elevator with up and down controls can be used to quickly get between the eight floors and the roof, with a staircase along the side for manual access. The bottom level is a reception room, with the top room being the boss's office. The floors in the middle are filled with cubical with various generated objects. Unlike other maps, gun (Laser Fight) will gun spawning (Laser Fight) across all the floors of the office building. The glass windows can be shattered by bullets, and the computers can be used and destroyed.
The void covering the bottom of the map is lethal, killing players on contact. The badge (Roblox) Long Way Down (Laser Fight) is awarded through dying this way.
