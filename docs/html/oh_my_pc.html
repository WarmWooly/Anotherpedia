It often uses a high quantity of [[items|item (Minecraft)]], [[entities|entity (Minecraft)]], or other system-taxing process to slow down the game. Even if the gameplay itself is not affected, the audio and video can be [[edited in post]] to make it appear like the game is lagging out. A notable part of the OH MY PC meme is how the person yelling also gets distorted, [[stuttering|audio stuttering]] and "lagging" like the footage (as if the [[recording software]] was also being impacted by computer resources being hogged by {{iMinecraft}}). Graphical artifacts, including triangular portions of the screen disappearing, may also occur to add more impact to the effect. The meme started in mid-2024 and was widely spread on [[TikTok]], [[YouTube Shorts]], and [[Reddit]].&pThe following sound is an example of the meme, with thousands of items suddenly picked up before the person yells "OH MY PC!":&sp<<audgit/oh my pc sfx.mp3aud>></div>
