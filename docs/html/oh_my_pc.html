      <h1>OH MY PC</h1>
      <div>OH MY PC is a meme created by LookOut3D of a person lagging in Minecraft to such a degree that their FPS decrease to below 1 with the person yelling "OH MY PC!". It often uses a high quantity of items, entities, or other system-taxing process to slow down the game. Even if the gameplay itself is not affected, the audio and video can be edited in post to make it appear like the game is lagging out. A notable part of the OH MY PC meme is how the person yelling also gets distorted, stuttering and "lagging" like the footage (as if the recording software was also being impacted by computer resources being hogged by Minecraft). Graphical artifacts, including triangular portions of the screen disappearing, may also occur to add more impact to the effect. The meme started in mid-2024 and was widely spread on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Reddit.&pThe following sound is an example of the meme, with thousands of items suddenly picked up before the person yells "OH MY PC!":&sp</div>
