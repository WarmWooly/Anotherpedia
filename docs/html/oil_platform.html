      <h1>Oil platform</h1>
      <div>An oil platform, also called an oil rig, is a large structure used to harvest natural gas and petroleum, often in the ocean. They can be placed in any large viable body of water, such as lakes and inland seas. There are multiple types, such as a fixed platform, on an artificial island, or a floating oil production system.</div>
