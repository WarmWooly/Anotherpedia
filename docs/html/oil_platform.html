      <h1>Oil platform</h1>
      <div>An oil platform, also called an oil rig, is a large structure used to harvesting natural gas and petroleum, often in the ocean. They can be placed in any large viable body of water, such as lake and inland sea. There are multiple types, such as a fixed platform, on an artificial island, or a floating production storage and offloading.</div>
