      <h1>Omanyte</h1>
      <div>Omanyte is a shelled cephalopod Rock and Water type Pokémon from the first generation.
Omanyte has a blue body mostly covered by its tan shell. What is exposed of Omanyte's body are ten short tentacles, with two of the tentacles being raised up like arms. In the center are a pair of large eyes, with two divots in the shell to accommodate them. The shell is in the shape of a helix with horizontal lines along it, matching the Helix Fossil.&pOmanyte's official size is 1 ft and 4 in., while weighing 16.5 lbs. Shiny Omanytes are magenta instead of blue with a slightly yellower shell.&pOmanyte's name is likely a play on Ammonite, a common name used to refer to Ammonoidea, which are an extinct subclass of cephalopods with distinct helix-shaped fossils.
Omanyte was an extinct Pokémon from "ancient times" until humans revived it. Omanyte's diet consists of plankton, feeding off the sea floor while using its tentacles to maneuver. It can also store and release air to increase or decrease its buoyancy, allowing it to float up or down. Omanyte hides in its hard shell when in danger, with bite marks on fossils suggesting that it was the prey of Archeops. Escaped or released Omanytes post-revival have become an invasive species.
An Omanyte has an 87.5/12.5 chance to be male or female. Omanyte is the 138th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color blue.&pOmanyte can be revived from a Helix Fossil and can evolve into Omastar at level 40.</div>
