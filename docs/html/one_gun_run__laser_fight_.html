      <h1>One Gun Run (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>One Gun Run is a mode in Laser Fight where the player spawns in with a single random gun. This is similar to the mode Starting Weapons, where players spawn with 3 random guns instead of 1. Guns will not spawn and can't be dropped in this mode.</div>
