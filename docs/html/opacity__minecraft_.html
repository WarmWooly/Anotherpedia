      <h1>Opacity (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>Opacity is a property of block (Minecraft) that affects light (Minecraft) in Minecraft. Most blocks are completely opaque, immediately stopping light and rendering (Minecraft) of blocks behind it. Others are translucent (glass (Minecraft), ice (Minecraft), water (Minecraft)) or transparent (air (Minecraft), barrier (Minecraft)) and allow blocks to be rendered through them. Some blocks only take up part of a full cube, such as slab (Minecraft), which blocks light from above or below itself, but not from the sides.<br><br>How light interacts with partial and translucent blocks depends on the characteristics of the block. Most notably, tinted glass (Minecraft) is a translucent block that fully stops the propagation of light. Some blocks like slime block (Minecraft), leaves (Minecraft), and ice only reduce sky light (Minecraft) and not block-based light sources. Light may also pass through some blocks despite being fully blocked, such as carpet (Minecraft) and cauldron (Minecraft).</div>
