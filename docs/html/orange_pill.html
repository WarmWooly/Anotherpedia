      <h1>Orange pill</h1>
      <div>For the album, see {{aiorangepilled (album).}}&spOrange pill, orangepill, orange pilled, or orangepilled refers to a slang term for people who either heavily invest in BitCoin or who adopt urbanist beliefs, especially regarding public transportation. Orange pill is 
 a variation of the red pill and blue pill.
When related to BitCoin, the orange pill refers to people dedicated to cryptocurrencies, especially BitCoin. The orange pill's color comes from BitCoin, which itself is orange. People are "orange pilled" if they mainly invest in BitCoin, discuss or watch the value of BitCoin at regular intervals, try to explain or get other people into BitCoin, or in some other way positively interact with BitCoin or the BitCoin brand at an abnormal rate compared to someone outside the cryptocurrency sphere.
When related to urbanism, the orange pill refers to people dedicated to improving public transportation and pushing away from car-centric infrastructure, especially as seen in the United States. The orange pill's color comes from the YouTuber Not Just Bikes' logo color, a popular urbanist who pushes for better transportation.</div>
