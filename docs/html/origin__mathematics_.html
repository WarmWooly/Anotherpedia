  <div><<shortLocation of where axes meetshort>><<img(src=git/origin.png(cap=The origin in 3D space.img>>The {{borigin}} in [[mathematics]] is the [[point|point (geometry)]] where the [[axes|axis]] on the [[coordinate plane]] meet, which is (0, 0). In the [[third dimension]], the origin is (0, 0, 0). This rule is true for every dimension. The main use of the origin is as an easy point of [[reference]] for [[equations|equation]] relating to [[geometry]].</div>
