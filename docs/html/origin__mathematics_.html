      <h1>Origin (mathematics)</h1>
      <div>The origin in mathematics is the point where the axes on the coordinate plane meet, which is (0, 0). In the third dimension, the origin is (0, 0, 0). This rule is true for every dimension. The main use of the origin is as an easy point of reference for equations relating to geometry.</div>
