  <h1>Original character</h1>
  <div>An original character, also known as a fan character or abbreviation, is a character, often based on media (such as TV show, movie, video game, et cetera), that is original compared to any other characters from that media. Many original characters are used for fan fiction works, roleplay, and artwork. They are almost exclusively outside of the canon for any story or franchise they come from, but OCs can be added into the canon by the author later on.&pOCs come in many forms and sizes, with a large portion being human, furry (anthropomorphic animal), or animal. Popular franchises such as My Little Pony, Sonic (franchise), and Pokémon often have OCs based on characters in the respective franchises. Many websites, such as DeviantART and Tumblr, are known for containing swaths of OCs.</div>
