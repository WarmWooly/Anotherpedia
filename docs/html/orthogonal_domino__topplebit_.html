      <h1>Orthogonal domino (ToppleBit)</h1>
      <div>The orthogonal domino is a cell in ToppleBit that carries the falling state in a single direction. The orthogonal domino is the simplest cell, facing north/south or east/west. The orthogonal domino turns to face the direction it is being pushed from, and will continue to topple the next cell in that same direction. If the orthogonal domino is being pushed from two directions (i.e. south and east) at the same time, it will prioritize falling in its set direction. If an orthogonal domino has already fallen, it cannot be pushed again.</div>
