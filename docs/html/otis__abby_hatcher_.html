  <div><<shortElevator operator in {{iAbby Hatcher}}short>><<img(src=git/otis.png(cap=Otis being [[cheerful]].img>>{{bOtis}} is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from the [[show]] {{i[[Abby Hatcher]]}}. Otis is considered a [[Fuzzly|Fuzzly (Abby Hatcher)]]. He was [[voiced|voice acting]] by [[Christian Dal Dosso]], to then be replaced with [[Matthew Mucci]] late into [[season 2|Abby Hatcher (season 2)]].<<hrBiologyhr>>His body is covered in a thick layer, while his skin is a light green. He has a pair of red eyebrows, purple eyes, and a mouth containing two teeth and a tongue. He has four legs, each being magenta up to the tips, which then become the same green as the body. He also has three tentacles sprouting from his head, which are longer than the legs.<<hrPowershr>>Otis can stretch his tentacles (including his legs) to extreme lengths, but there is a limit to the [[distance]] and [[strain]] that can be put onto them. They also act like hands, being able to manipulate [[objects|object]]. He is able to sprout [[octopus]]-like [[suction cups|suction cup]] to increase [[grip]] onto objects, despite being rarely utilized. These suction cups can also be used to [[exhale]].&pOtis is able to stay [[active]] with little [[sleep]]. His main [[strategy]] is to sleep for [[minutes|minute]] at a time throughout the [[day]]. He is, however, still able to become [[tired]].<<hrPersonality and occupationhr>><<img(src=git/otis doff.jpeg(cap=Otis [[doffing]] his hat out of [[respect]] (despite not being proper [[hatiquette]]).img>>Otis is often seen being [[cheerful]] and [[naive]], alongside having [[symptoms|symptom]] to [[ADHD|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], where he constantly is pressing any [[button]] he sees. His [[catchphrase]] is {{iDing!}}, which is the same sound of the [[desk bell]] at the [[front desk]] of the [[hotel]] he likes to press. This button-related [[addiction]] is often used as a source of conflict in the [[episodes|episode]], which is then fixed after Otis realizes his mistakes. He also likes to play the [[accordion]] which was given to him by [[Abby Hatcher|Abby Hatcher (character)]], which he has relatively [[mastered|mastery]]. He is also quite skilled at making [[smoothies|smoothie]].&pOtis works as the hotel's [[elevator operator]] due to the job's primary [[tasks|task]] being pressing buttons and [[talking]] to others. He has his own [[cap]] he [[dons|donning]] whenever he performs his job, which consists of a purple body which slightly tapers from top to bottom. The brim is colored gold, as a detailed black band with gold edges and design wrap around the middle of the hat.</div>
