      <h1>Otis (Abby Hatcher)</h1>
      <div>Otis is a fictional character from the show Abby Hatcher. Otis is considered a Fuzzly (Abby Hatcher). He was voice acting by Christian Dal Dosso, to then be replaced with Matthew Mucci late into Abby Hatcher (season 2).

His body is covered in a thick layer, while his skin is a light green. He has a pair of red eyebrows, purple eyes, and a mouth containing two teeth and a tongue. He has four legs, each being magenta up to the tips, which then become the same green as the body. He also has three tentacles sprouting from his head, which are longer than the legs.

Otis can stretch his tentacles (including his legs) to extreme lengths, but there is a limit to the distance and strain that can be put onto them. They also act like hands, being able to manipulate object. He is able to sprout octopus-like suction cup to increase grip onto objects, despite being rarely utilized. These suction cups can also be used to exhale.<br><br>Otis is able to stay active with little sleep. His main strategy is to sleep for minute at a time throughout the day. He is, however, still able to become tired.

Otis is often seen being cheerful and naive, alongside having symptom to Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, where he constantly is pressing any button he sees. His catchphrase is Ding!, which is the same sound of the desk bell at the front desk of the hotel he likes to press. This button-related addiction is often used as a source of conflict in the episode, which is then fixed after Otis realizes his mistakes. He also likes to play the accordion which was given to him by Abby Hatcher (character), which he has relatively mastery. He is also quite skilled at making smoothie.<br><br>Otis works as the hotel's elevator operator due to the job's primary task being pressing buttons and talking to others. He has his own cap he donning whenever he performs his job, which consists of a purple body which slightly tapers from top to bottom. The brim is colored gold, as a detailed black band with gold edges and design wrap around the middle of the hat.</div>
