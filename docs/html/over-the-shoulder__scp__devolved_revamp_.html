      <h1>Over-the-shoulder (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>Over-the-shoulder is a togglable camera angle within SCP: Devolved Revamp. The angle can be toggled with codeCtrl, changing the cursor to a simple black reticle with a white center and pushing the camera to the right while in third person, simulating a traditional over-the-shoulder angle. The camera can't be changed to be on the left side. The cursor is locked while the over-the-shoulder is active. Over-the-shoulder is most useful for rotating without moving outside of first person, peaking around walls (only to the right), and for aiming guns in third person. The camera can clip through small walls and doors, allowing the player to peek around areas that they are not supposed to view (i.e. looking for combatants while in a room, viewing rooms without proper clearance).</div>
