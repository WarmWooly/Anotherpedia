  <h1>Over-the-shoulder ({{iSCP: Devolved Revamp}})</h1>
  <div><<shortAlternate third-person angleshort>><<img(src=git/over-the-shoulder scpdr.png(cap=Over-the-shoulder targeted at [[SCP-999|SCP-999 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]].img>>{{bOver-the-shoulder}} is a togglable [[camera angle]] within {{i[[SCP: Devolved Revamp]]}}. The angle can be toggled with {{codeCtrl}}, changing the [[cursor]] to a simple black [[reticle]] with a white center and pushing the camera to the right while in [[third person|third person camera]], simulating a traditional [[over-the-shoulder]] angle. The camera can't be changed to be on the left side. The cursor is locked while the over-the-shoulder is active.<<img(src=git/over-the-shoulder fp scpdr.png(cap=Over-the-shoulder in first person.(leftImgimg>> Over-the-shoulder is most useful for rotating without moving outside of [[first person|first person camera]], peaking around walls (only to the right), and for aiming [[guns|gun (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]] in third person. The camera can clip through small walls and doors, allowing the player to peek around areas that they are not supposed to view (i.e. looking for combatants while in a room, viewing rooms without proper [[clearance|keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]).</div>
