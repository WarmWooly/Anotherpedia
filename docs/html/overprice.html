  <h1>Overprice</h1>
  <div><<shortCost higher than reasonableshort>><<img(src=git/overprice.png(cap=A [[graph]] showing the price [[housing]] compared to [[renting]] and [[household income]] in the [[western United States]].img>>{{bOverprice}} describes the [[price]] of an [[object]] or [[service]] for [[purchase]] being set higher than what would be deemed [[reasonable]]. Overpricing is often done when there is a lack of [[incentive]] to keep prices low, such as being a [[monopoly]] of a [[product|product (business)]] or pushing away [[competition]] from an area to become the sole [[provider]] of a [[good|goods]] or [[service]]. Other factors that lead to something becoming overpriced are [[greed]] and [[artificial scarcity]].</div>
