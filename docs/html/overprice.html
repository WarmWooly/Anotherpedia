      <h1>Overprice</h1>
      <div>Overprice describes the price of an object or service for purchase being set higher than what would be deemed reasonable. Overpricing is often done when there is a lack of incentive to keep prices low, such as being a monopoly of a product (business) or pushing away competition from an area to become the sole provider of a goods or service. Other factors that lead to something becoming overpriced are greed and artificial scarcity.</div>
