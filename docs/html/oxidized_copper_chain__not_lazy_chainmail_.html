      <h1>Oxidized Copper Chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|6||Hardness|4||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The oxidized copper chain is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used in crafting and as decoration.



The oxidized copper chain can be crafted with an oxidized block of copper chains (makes 4).

Either through random ticks or by right-clicking with a vinegar bottle, a weathered copper chain will become an oxidized copper chain. Using a vinegar bottle to oxidize will award the advancement Oxide On.

Right-clicking a waxed oxidized copper chain with an axe will turn the block into an oxidized copper chain. This will award the advancement Wax Off.
