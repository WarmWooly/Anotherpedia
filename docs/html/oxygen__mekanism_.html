  <h1>Oxygen (Mekanism)</h1>
  <div>Oxygen is a gas (Mekanism) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Mekanism used for breathing and creation of other chemical, alongside ore (Minecraft) refinery. It can be stored in Gas Tank (Mekanism) and transported with pressurized tube (Mekanism).
In a Electrolytic Separator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:&sp2 millibuckets Water (Minecraft) --> 2 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism) + 1 mB Oxygen&sp2 mB Heavy Water (Mekanism) --> 2 mB Deuterium (Mekanism) + 1 mB Oxygen
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:&sp200 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Ethylene (Mekanism) + 1 substrate (Mekanism) --> 8 substrate (Mekanism) + 10 mB Oxygen
In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:&sp1 mB Liquid Oxygen (Mekanism) --> 1 mB Oxygen
In a Chemical Infuser (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp1 mB Oxygen + 2 mB Sulfur Dioxide (Mekanism) --> 2 mB Sulfur Trioxide (Mekanism)
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp1000 mB Water (Minecraft) + 1000 mB Oxygen + 1 Block of Coal (Minecraft) or Charcoal Block (Mekanism) --> 9 Sulfur Dust (Mekanism) + 1000 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp100 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Oxygen + 1 Coal (Minecraft) or Charcoal (Minecraft) --> 1 Sulfur Dust (Mekanism) + 100 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp100 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Oxygen + 1 Log (Minecraft) --> 100 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp20 mB Water (Minecraft) + 20 mB Oxygen + 1 Sawdust (Mekanism) --> 20 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp20 mB Water (Minecraft) + 20 mB Oxygen + 1 Planks (Minecraft) --> 20 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp10 mB Water (Minecraft) + 10 mB Oxygen + 1 Wooden Slab (Minecraft) --> 10 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp4 mB Water (Minecraft) + 4 mB Oxygen + 1 Stick (Minecraft) --> 4 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)&sp50 mB Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism) + 10 mB Oxygen + 1 Substrate (Mekanism) --> 1 HDPE Pellet (Mekanism) + 5 mB Oxygen
In a Purification Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Iron Ore (Minecraft) --> 3 Iron Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gold Ore (Minecraft) --> 3 Gold Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Tin Ore (Mekanism) --> 3 Tin Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Copper Ore (Mekanism) --> 3 Copper Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Osmium Ore (Mekanism) --> 3 Osmium Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Iron Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Iron Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gold Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Gold Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Tin Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Tin Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Copper Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Copper Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Osmium Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Osmium Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Silver Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Silver Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Lead Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Lead Clump (Mekanism)&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gravel (Minecraft) --> 1 Flint (Minecraft)
In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp1 mB Oxygen --> 1 mB Liquid Oxygen (Mekanism)
Oxygen is used to fuel the Scuba Tank (Mekanism) for breathing.</div>
