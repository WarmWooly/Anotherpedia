      <h1>Oxygen (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>Oxygen is a gas (Mekanism) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Mekanism used for breathing and creation of other chemical, alongside ore (Minecraft) refinery. It can be stored in Gas Tank (Mekanism) and transported with pressurized tube (Mekanism).



In a Electrolytic Separator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:<br>2 millibuckets Water (Minecraft) --> 2 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism) + 1 mB Oxygen<br>2 mB Heavy Water (Mekanism) --> 2 mB Deuterium (Mekanism) + 1 mB Oxygen

In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:<br>200 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Ethylene (Mekanism) + 1 substrate (Mekanism) --> 8 substrate (Mekanism) + 10 mB Oxygen

In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:<br>1 mB Liquid Oxygen (Mekanism) --> 1 mB Oxygen



In a Chemical Infuser (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:<br>1 mB Oxygen + 2 mB Sulfur Dioxide (Mekanism) --> 2 mB Sulfur Trioxide (Mekanism)

In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:<br>1000 mB Water (Minecraft) + 1000 mB Oxygen + 1 Block of Coal (Minecraft) or Charcoal Block (Mekanism) --> 9 Sulfur Dust (Mekanism) + 1000 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>100 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Oxygen + 1 Coal (Minecraft) or Charcoal (Minecraft) --> 1 Sulfur Dust (Mekanism) + 100 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>100 mB Water (Minecraft) + 100 mB Oxygen + 1 Log (Minecraft) --> 100 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>20 mB Water (Minecraft) + 20 mB Oxygen + 1 Sawdust (Mekanism) --> 20 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>20 mB Water (Minecraft) + 20 mB Oxygen + 1  Planks (Minecraft) --> 20 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>10 mB Water (Minecraft) + 10 mB Oxygen + 1 Wooden Slab (Minecraft) --> 10 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>4 mB Water (Minecraft) + 4 mB Oxygen + 1 Stick (Minecraft) --> 4 mB Hydrogen (Mekanism)<br>50 mB Liquid Ethylene (Mekanism) + 10 mB Oxygen + 1 Substrate (Mekanism) --> 1 HDPE Pellet (Mekanism) + 5 mB Oxygen

In a Purification Chamber (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Iron Ore (Minecraft) --> 3 Iron Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gold Ore (Minecraft) --> 3 Gold Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Tin Ore (Mekanism) --> 3 Tin Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Copper Ore (Mekanism) --> 3 Copper Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Osmium Ore (Mekanism) --> 3 Osmium Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Iron Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Iron Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gold Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Gold Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Tin Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Tin Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Copper Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Copper Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Osmium Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Osmium Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Silver Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Silver Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Lead Shard (Mekanism) --> 1 Lead Clump (Mekanism)<br>200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gravel (Minecraft) --> 1 Flint (Minecraft)

In a Rotary Condensentrator (Mekanism), the following reactions can be made with oxygen:<br>1 mB Oxygen --> 1 mB Liquid Oxygen (Mekanism)

Oxygen is used to fuel the Scuba Tank (Mekanism) for breathing.</div>
