      <h1>Oxygen (Mekanism)</h1>
      <div>Oxygen is a gas in the Minecraft mod Mekanism used for breathing and creation of other chemicals, alongside ore refinery. It can be stored in gas tanks and transported with pressurized tubes.
In a Electrolytic Separator, the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:&sp2 mB Water --> 2 mB Hydrogen + 1 mB Oxygen&sp2 mB Heavy Water --> 2 mB Deuterium + 1 mB Oxygen
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber, the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:&sp200 mB Water + 100 mB Ethylene + 1 Substrate --> 8 Substrate + 10 mB Oxygen
In a Rotary Condensentrator, the following reactions can be made to obtain oxygen:&sp1 mB Liquid Oxygen --> 1 mB Oxygen
In a Chemical Infuser, the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp1 mB Oxygen + 2 mB Sulfur Dioxide --> 2 mB Sulfur Trioxide
In a Pressurized Reaction Chamber, the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp1000 mB Water + 1000 mB Oxygen + 1 Block of Coal or Charcoal Block --> 9 Sulfur Dust + 1000 mB Hydrogen&sp100 mB Water + 100 mB Oxygen + 1 Coal or Charcoal --> 1 Sulfur Dust + 100 mB Hydrogen&sp100 mB Water + 100 mB Oxygen + 1 Log --> 100 mB Hydrogen&sp20 mB Water + 20 mB Oxygen + 1 Sawdust --> 20 mB Hydrogen&sp20 mB Water + 20 mB Oxygen + 1 Planks --> 20 mB Hydrogen&sp10 mB Water + 10 mB Oxygen + 1 Wooden Slab --> 10 mB Hydrogen&sp4 mB Water + 4 mB Oxygen + 1 Stick --> 4 mB Hydrogen&sp50 mB Liquid Ethylene + 10 mB Oxygen + 1 Substrate --> 1 HDPE Pellet + 5 mB Oxygen
In a Purification Chamber, the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Iron Ore --> 3 Iron Clumps&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gold Ore --> 3 Gold Clumps&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Tin Ore --> 3 Tin Clumps&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Copper Ore --> 3 Copper Clumps&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Osmium Ore --> 3 Osmium Clumps&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Iron Shard --> 1 Iron Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gold Shard --> 1 Gold Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Tin Shard --> 1 Tin Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Copper Shard --> 1 Copper Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Osmium Shard --> 1 Osmium Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Silver Shard --> 1 Silver Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Lead Shard --> 1 Lead Clump&sp200 mB Oxygen + 1 Gravel --> 1 Flint
In a Rotary Condensentrator, the following reactions can be made with oxygen:&sp1 mB Oxygen --> 1 mB Liquid Oxygen
Oxygen is used to fuel the Scuba Tank for breathing.</div>
