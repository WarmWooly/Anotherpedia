      <h1>Pallet</h1>
      <div>A pallet is a flat structure, made of wood or plastic used to aid in the transportation of multiple or large objects, such as home appliances or bulk goods. They are moved using vehicles such as a pallet jack or a forklift. Pallets are typically used as the base for a unit load, where strapping or stretch wrap are used to keep multiple loose items bound and secure to the pallet. Despite pallets such as the EUR-pallet, there is still a lack of international standardization for the size and scale of pallets. Pallet racks are used to hold multiple pallets in one place.</div>
