      <h1>Pallet rack</h1>
      <div>A pallet rack is a rack used for holding pallets in a storage system. Multiple pallet racks used together in a system are known as pallet racking. Pallet racks are nearly exclusively made of metal, where they may have plastic rollers to make it easier to rack and unrack pallets.</div>
