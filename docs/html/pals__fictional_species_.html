There are currently 187 unique Pals <<asofJune 2025>>, not including new Pals shown in teasers or trailers.&pMost Pals are derived from real-life animals, including turtles (Digtoise), cows (Mozzarina), wolves (Direhowl), and alpacas (Melpaca), only being a few of the many represented in Palworld. Others may take from mythology (such as the Egyptian mythology-inspired Mau), fantasy creatures (such as the wyvern Quivern), or objects (such as the jet aircraft-based Jetragon).</div>
