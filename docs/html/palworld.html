      <h1>Palworld</h1>
      <div>{{bPalworld}} is an upcoming release video game that is being developed by PocketPair Inc., which was pre-release on January 19th, 2024. It aims to push the monster-taming game genre, playing off the success of the Pokémon, while including elements of survival game and action-adventure game. It is open world, and can be played singleplayer or online multiplayer with up to 32 players on a server. It is a combination of pal and world, with the primary species inhabiting Palworld being Pal (fictional species). Its main draw is the satire nature of the gameplay compared to the tamer Pokémon games, allowing the player to eat Pals, force Pals to animal servitude, or equip Pals with gun. Palword is similar to their other open-world early-release title, Craftopia (2020), also mixing features for the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</div>
