      <h1>Palworld</h1>
      <div>{{bPalworld}} is an upcoming video game that is being developed by Pocket Pair, which was pre-released on January 19th, 2024. It aims to push the monster-taming game genre, playing off the success of the Pokémon franchise, while including elements of survival and action-adventure. It is open world, and can be played singleplayer or online with up to 32 players on a server. It is a combination of pal and world, with the primary species inhabiting Palworld being Pals. Its main draw is the satirical nature of the gameplay compared to the tamer Pokémon games, allowing the player to eat Pals, force Pals to work, or equip Pals with guns. Palword is similar to their other open-world early-release title, Craftopia (2020), also mixing features for the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</div>
