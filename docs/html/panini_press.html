      <h1>Panini press</h1>
      <div>A panini press is a cooking appliance used to prepare paninis, consisting of a pair of metallic heated plates with vertical grooves, used to evenly apply pressure and toast the panini. The main difference between a panini press and a sandwich press is how the method of heating in the panini press crisps the outside while warming the inside, instead of evenly cooking the entire sandwich. It also aids in flattening the panini to get it to the correct shape.</div>
