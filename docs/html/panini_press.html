  <h1>Panini press</h1>
  <div><<shortCooking appliance to make paninisshort>><<img(src=git/panini press.jpg(cap=A panini press.img>>A {{bpanini press}} is a [[cooking appliance]] used to prepare [[paninis|panini (sandwich)]], consisting of a pair of [[metallic]] [[heated plates|heating element]] with vertical grooves, used to evenly apply pressure and [[toast|toasting]] the panini. The main difference between a panini press and a [[sandwich press]] is how the method of heating in the panini press crisps the outside while warming the inside, instead of evenly cooking the entire [[sandwich]]. It also aids in flattening the panini to get it to the correct shape.</div>
