  <h1>Papal fanon</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the combination of "fan" and "canon", see fanon (fiction).}}&spA {{bpapal fanon}}, also called a {{bfanon}}, is a religious vestment worn by the pope that goes around the neck. It is worn when the pope attends a Pontifical High Mass. Its use has dwindled, with Pope Francis having not donned it during his election in 2013.</div>
