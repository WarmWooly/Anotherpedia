      <h1>Papal fanon</h1>
      <div>For the combination of "fan" and "canon", see fanon (fiction).&spA papal fanon, also called a fanon, is a religious vestment worn by the pope that goes around the neck. It is worn when the pope attends a Pontifical High Mass. Its use has dwindled, with Pope Francis having not donned it during his election in 2013.</div>
