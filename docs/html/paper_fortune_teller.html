  <h1>Paper fortune teller</h1>
  <div><<shortOrigami children's toyshort>><<img(src=git/paper fortune teller.png(cap=A blank paper fortune teller.img>>A {{bpaper fortune teller}}, also called a {{bcootie catcher}}, {{bsalt cellar}}, and {{bchatterbox}}, is an [[origami]] [[paper toy]] played by [[children]]. Eight sections are labeled with [[numbers|number]] with eight messages hidden underneath the construction's [[flaps|flap]]. The main purpose, as its most common name suggests, is to [[tell fortunes|fortune telling]] by having a person manipulate the fortune teller based on answers given by someone else. As its construction only requires a single piece [[paper|paper sheet]] and optionally [[scissors]], it can be easily made by children.<<hrConstructionhr>><<img(src=git/paper fortune teller made.gif(cap=A guide on making a paper fortune teller.img>>To create a paper fortune teller, obtain a piece of paper and scissors if the paper is not already a [[square]], then: ::Fold the top left corner of the paper as close to the bottom right corner.|Fold the top right corner as close to the bottom left.|If the paper is rectangular, use the scissors to remove the overhanging piece of paper.|Unfold the paper back into a square.|Fold all four corners into the middle, creating a smaller square.|Flip the paper over.|Fold all four corners into the middle again.|Fold the square in half along one of the creases.|Pop open the corners with your fingers.::After the fortune teller is created, unfold the entire construction to color and write inside. The following is what is typically used for customizing a fortune teller: ::Color the four corners, shown with folds that resemble squares, red, blue, green, and yellow.|Complete steps 5 and 6, returning to the flipped-over smaller square.|Write eight messages in each of the triangular sections in the corners of the square.|Complete step 7, making the even smaller square.|Write the numbers 1 through 8 in the remaining eight triangular sections.|Complete steps 8 and 9, finishing the fortune teller.::<<hrUsagehr>>To use a paper fortune teller, hold each side of the fortune teller using both hands. Put your index fingers in the back two corners and your thumbs in the front two. Press all the corners together to close the fortune teller. The fortune teller can be opened by extending the index fingers and thumbs apart or moving the hands apart.<<hr2Fortune tellinghr2>>The person holding the fortune teller is the "teller," while the other person answering questions is the "player." The teller asks the player to pick one of the four colors corresponding to the colored corners. After a color is selected, the teller says each letter in the color aloud and closes and opens the fortune teller for each letter. Then, the teller will ask the player to select a number. The teller will close and open the fortune teller that many times. Lastly, the player will select one final number. Flatten out the fortune teller and unfold the flap. Read out the fortune underneath the selected number.<<hr3Similar useshr3>>Alteratively from telling fortunes, the fortune teller can have other uses based on the messages written. It can be used as a [[Magic 8 Ball]] by writing "Yes," "No," "Ask again later," and other similar messages. It can be used as an [[ice breaker|social ice breaker]] by having personal questions, such as "What is your [[favorite food]]?", "Do you own any [[pets|pet]]?", "Do you like [[pineapple on pizza]]?", and so on. Fortune tellers may also be based on [[franchises|franchise]], including {{i[[Harry Potter]]}}, {{i[[Star Wars]]}}, and {{i[[The Wizard of Oz]]}}. Realistically, any message can be put inside a fortune teller, making it a very versatile and customizable toy.<<hr2Cootie catchinghr2>>The cootie catcher can be used to grab [[cooties]], an [[imaginary]] [[disease]], from people. This is done by opening up the catcher, placing it close to the target, then closing the catcher to snag the cooties. To make it easier to manipulate, use the thumb and three fingers from the same hand to open the catcher. Markings and colors are not needed, but decoration is recommended to make it more appealing. The cootie catcher has even been seen in [[cartoons|cartoon]], as a [[cootie catcher|Cootie Catcher (Teen Titans Go!)]] appears in {{i[[Teen Titans Go!]]}} "[[Boys vs Girls|Boys vs Girls (Teen Titans Go!)]]".<<hr2Salt dispensinghr2>>The form of the fortune teller can be used as a [[salt cellar]] when flipped upside down. The four pockets created can be used to hold [[salt]], however, this functionality is almost never used today. Children would have also used the pockets to store other [[sweets|candy]] and [[biscuts|biscut]].</div>
