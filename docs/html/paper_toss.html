      <h1>Paper Toss</h1>
      <div>{{iPaper Toss}} was a mobile video game developed for the iPhone by Backflip Studios, being released in 2009. The game would have the player throw a crumpled paper ball towards an orange trash can. The paper ball is affected by wind, causing the ball to change direction mid-flight, requiring the player to predict how far they need to adjust their throw's angle to account for the additional air movement. Paper Toss was downloaded over 50 million times by 2011. Backflip Studios would continue making games off of Paper Toss, including Paper Toss World Tour (2009), Paper Toss 2.0 (2011), and Paper Toss Friends (2012).</div>
