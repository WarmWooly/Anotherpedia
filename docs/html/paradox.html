      <h1>Paradox</h1>
      <div>A paradox is a logical statement that is self-contradicting, where it runs against the expectations from the norm. A simple example is a catch-22 from Catch-22, where regardless of what a person does, no change will be made in a system's predetermined outcome (ex. a person trying to get a job must have work experience, which they can't get without a job, leading to the predetermined outcome of staying unemployed).</div>
