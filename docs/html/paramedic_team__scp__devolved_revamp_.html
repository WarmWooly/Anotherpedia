      <h1>Paramedic Team (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>The Parametic Team (PT) is a role within SCP: Devolved Revamp who can heal other players. The PT get a medkit, which they can use on all other non-CI players (not including themselves). PT members should focus on healing allies in battle or fixing up Class D after interacting with SCPs.

The PT has 5 levels, with each giving a new title and increasing the healing power of the medkit. At levels 3 and 5, their keycard access also increases.<<table |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Level 4|Level 5||Title|"Trainee"|"Field Medic"|"Advanced Care"|"Critical Healer"|"Program Leader"||Healing|10 HP|15 HP|20 HP|25 HP|30 HP||Keycard|Level 1|Level 1|Level 2|Level 2|Level 3table>>

PTs spawn in a room labeled "Paramedic Team" in Sector 1 of the Facility. The room requires a Level 1 Keycard to enter. The back of the room has file cabinets, an armchair, and a plant in the left corner of the door. A long gray/white table sits in the center with a medkit, with cabinets to the right containing more medkits, bottles, loose papers, a mug, and a little guy in a jar. Against the front wall is a water cooler, a clock, a poster showing information related to facility lighting, and another plant. To the left is a table with a mug and a pair of chairs, a large whiteboard with random math and SCP-999, an interactible uniform stand, and a TV with the following information:</div>
