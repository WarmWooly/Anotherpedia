      <h1>Parking space</h1>
      <div>A parking space or parking spot is a dedicated area for parking, usually around a point of interest, such as a house, business, or store. Parking spaces may be laid out in flat areas (parking lot), in dedicated building (parking garage), or alongside street (street parking). Parking spaces are denoted with some form of road surface marking, barrier, or other visual indicator to keep vehicles separated and orderly when parking.</div>
