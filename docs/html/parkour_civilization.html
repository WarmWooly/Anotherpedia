The Parkour Villain tells Evbo that he will use the command blocks to wipe Evbo before a scared parkour master challenges Evbo to a race. Evbo wins, killing the master, before returning the climb. Despite not being able to see the pathway up the master portion of the Parkour Temple, Evbo memorized it and completed the invisible jumps. After reaching the top, Evbo sees the Parkour Villain and a complex course set up. The Parkour Villain started a race with Evbo. Unbeknownst to Evbo, his side of the course wasn't fully complete, stopping him from reaching the end. Deciding that he would die if he stayed still, Evbo in a last-ditch effort jumps into the air. He finds himself and the parkour god standing on two grass blocks, with the parkour god determining that Evbo will be his successor. The parkour god tells Evbo that he will become parkour, before disappearing. Evbo returns to falling, with his chainmail boots (Minecraft) turning into netherite boots (Minecraft) while conjuring a ladder to grab hold of. The dumbfounded Parkour Villain pauses when he sees Evbo alive as Evbo continues to replicate the parkour course on his side. Evbo manages to make it a split second before the Parkour Villain (even with a 360), killing him and winning the race. It is revealed that the parkour master friend is now the parkour champion, with Evbo the new parkour god. Evbo then makes one final jump off the Parkour Temple and disappears.
