Unbeknownst to Evbo, his side of the course wasn't fully complete, stopping him from reaching the end. Deciding that he would die if he stayed still, Evbo in a last-ditch effort jumps into the air. He finds himself and the parkour god standing on two grass blocks, with the parkour god determining that Evbo will be his successor. The parkour god tells Evbo that he will become parkour, before disappearing. Evbo returns to falling, with his chainmail boots turning into netherite boots while conjuring a ladder to grab hold of.

Evbo manages to make it a split second before the Parkour Villain (even with a 360), killing him and winning the race. It is revealed that the parkour master friend is now the parkour champion, with Evbo the new parkour god. Evbo then makes one final jump off the Parkour Temple and disappears.
