      <h1>Pearldle Theme Song</h1>
      <div>"Pearldle Theme Song" is a song for the minigame Pearldle from the Minecraft SMP series HermitCraft season 10. The song was released on YouTube on September 21, 2025, which was made by TheOrionSound and features PearlescentMoon‬. The song serves as a catchy track for the game and as an audible timer for players to tell them how much time is remaining. The energy of the song builds up over time, until the final minute, where it becomes somber as the player at this point would be about to lose at Pearldle.
