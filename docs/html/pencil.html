      <h1>Pencil</h1>
      <div>A pencil is a tool used for writing with a core of material (often graphite) surrounded with an outer casing (such as wood or plastic). Pencils may also have an attached eraser to remove marks made. Pencil sharpeners are used to sharpen pencils for reuse. Some pencils are mechanical, where the graphite is fed into the pencil and pushed up for use.</div>
