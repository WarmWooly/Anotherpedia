      <h1>Phenylacetone</h1>
      <div><<nodanger>>Phenylacetone, also going by the name of phenyl-2-propanone, is an organic chemical created by organism and is used in the production of methamphetamine. Phenylacetone is most often found in the form of a colorless oil. Streptomyces and Mexican cotton have been known to create phenylacetone. Phenylacetone's chemical formula is Carbons-b6Hydrogens-b5CHs-b2COxygenCHs-b3, which can be shortened to Cs-b9Hs-b10O.

Penylacetone can be natural produced by metabolism in the human liver during the process of removing amphetamine from the body. When flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 catalyse the oxidative deamination of amphetamine, it produces phenylacetone. This is then turned into 4-hydroxyphenylacetone and benzoic acid. The enzyme responsible for catalyzing phenylacetone into 4-hydroxyphenylacetone and benzoic acid are not known. The benzoic acid is then conjugation by xenobiotic/medium-chain fatty acid-ligase and glycine N-acyltransferase into hippuric acid.

Phenylacetone can be utilized in the production of methamphetamine via reductive amination or a Leuckart reaction. In the United States, it's precursor (chemistry) phenylacetic acid is regulated under the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act because of this. Similarly, in Brazil, it is under the Brazilian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as a Class D. It is used in the production of methamphetamine by using reductive amination with methylamine. It is also used in a Leuckart reaction with N-Methylformamide.</div>
