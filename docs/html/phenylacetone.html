      <h1>Phenylacetone</h1>
      <div><<shortOrganic chemical used in methamphetamineshort>><<nodanger>><<img(src=git/phenylacetone.png(cap=A [[diagram]] of the structure of phenylacetone.img>>{{bPhenylacetone}}, also going by the name of phenyl-2-propanone, is an [[organic]] [[chemical]] created by [[organisms|organism]] and is used in the production of [[methamphetamine]]. Phenylacetone is most often found in the form of a [[colorless]] [[oil]]. [[Streptomyces]] and [[Mexican cotton]] have been known to create phenylacetone. Phenylacetone's [[chemical formula]] is [[C|Carbon]]{{s-b6}}[[H|Hydrogen]]{{s-b5}}CH{{s-b2}}C[[O|Oxygen]]CH{{s-b3}}, which can be shortened to C{{s-b9}}H{{s-b10}}O.<<hrMetabolic processhr>>Penylacetone can be [[naturally|natural]] produced by [[metabolism]] in the [[human]] [[liver]] during the [[process]] of removing [[amphetamine]] from the body. When [[flavin-containing monooxygenase 3]] [[catalyses|catalyse]] the [[oxidative deamination]] of amphetamine, it produces phenylacetone. This is then turned into [[4-hydroxyphenylacetone]] and [[benzoic acid]]. The [[enzymes|enzyme]] responsible for catalyzing phenylacetone into 4-hydroxyphenylacetone and benzoic acid are not known. The benzoic acid is then [[conjugated|conjugation]] by [[xenobiotic/medium-chain fatty acid-ligase]] and [[glycine N-acyltransferase]] into [[hippuric acid]].<<hrRegulation and drug productionhr>>Phenylacetone can be utilized in the production of [[methamphetamine]] via [[reductive amination]] or a [[Leuckart reaction]]. In the [[United States]], it's [[precursor|precursor (chemistry)]] [[phenylacetic acid]] is regulated under the [[Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act]] because of this. Similarly, in [[Brazil]], it is under the [[Brazilian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] as a Class D. It is used in the production of methamphetamine by using reductive amination with [[methylamine]]. It is also used in a [[Leuckart reaction]] with [[N-Methylformamide]].<<img(src=git/meth production.png(cap=A reductive amination used to make methamphetamine with methylamine and phenylacetone.(brightImg(spanImgimg>><<img(src=git/meth leuckart.png(cap=A Leukart reaction used to make methamphetamine with phenylacetone and N-Methylformamide.(brightImg(bigImgimg>></div>
