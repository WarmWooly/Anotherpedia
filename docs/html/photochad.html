      <h1>Photochad</h1>
      <div>Photochad is a Joker combination within Balatro with the Jokers Photograph and Hanging Chad. Photograph gives x2 Mult for the first scored face card each time it scores, while Hanging Chad retriggers the first card in the hand twice. If a face card is the first card played using this combination, instead of x2 Mult, the hand would gain x8 Mult because of the additional triggers. Since Photograph and Hanging Chad are Commons, they appear much more frequently in the Shop compared to other Joker combinations. Additionally, their solid Mult scaling can help carry a run.

The following requirements are needed to pull off Photochad:;;The Jokers Photograph and Hanging Chad|Many face cards that can be played;;

The following will improve the odds of Photochad working:;;Additional retriggering Jokers (Sock and Buskin, Dusk, Seltzer)|Showman or Invisible Joker to get additional copies of Photograph or Hanging Chad|Blueprint or Brainstorm to copy Photograph or Hanging Chad|Antimatter or Ectoplasm to increase the number of usable Jokers|Red Seals on face cards as an additional trigger for Photograph|Having many face cards, especially when they outnumber numbered cards and Aces;;The following will greatly decrease the viability or potentially kill Photochad:;;Relying on numbered cards/Aces for scoring|Having few face cards (such as from the Abandoned Deck)|The Boss Blind The Plant;;

Main page: Scoring optimization (aiBalatro)<br>For Photochad, the optimal setup has a balance between playing card triggers and Photograph triggers per card trigger. Normally, with just Photograph and Hanging Chad, there would be 3 card triggers (1 normally, 2 from Hanging Chad) and 1 Photograph trigger. To find the final Mult multiplier, follow code2s-u(Cs-bt * Ps-bt), where Cs-bt is a card trigger and Ps-bt is a Photograph trigger. With the most basic Photochad, the Mult multiplier would be code2s-u(3 * 1) = 2s-u3 = 8. For example, using 2 Photographs, 1 Hanging Chad, 1 Blueprint, and 1 Brainstorm, the optimal setup is copying 1 Photograph for 3 Ps-bt in total and 1 Hanging Chad for 5 Cs-bt in total. The Mult multiplier would be code2s-u(5 * 3) = 2s-u15 = 32,768 for the optimized combination. The following table is a quick reference for how different values for Cs-bt (horizontal axis) and Ps-bt (vertical axis) impact Mult multiplier, with a balance between Cs-bt and Ps-bt having a higher Mult multiplier overall:<<table|c1|c2|c3|c4|c5||1|r2|r4|r8|r16|r32||2|r4|r16|r64|r256|r1,024||3|r8|r64|r512|r4,096|r32,768||4|r16|r256|r4,096|r65,536|r1,048,576||5|r32|r1,024|r32,768|r1,048,576|r33,554,432table>></div>
