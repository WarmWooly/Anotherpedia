  <h1>Photochad</h1>
  <div><<shortFace card-based Joker combo in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/photochad.png(cap=The Jokers needed for Photochad.img>>{{bPhotochad}} is a [[Joker combination|Joker combination (Balatro)]] within {{i[[Balatro]]}} with the [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]] [[Photograph|Photograph (Balatro)]] and [[Hanging Chad|Hanging Chad (Balatro)]]. Photograph gives x2 [[Mult|Mult (Balatro)]] for the first [[scored|scoring card (Balatro)]] [[face card|Face card (Balatro)]] each time it scores, while Hanging Chad [[retriggers|retrigger (Balatro)]] the first card in the [[hand|hand (Balatro)]] twice. If a face card is the first card played using this combination, instead of x2 Mult, the hand would gain x8 Mult because of the additional triggers. Since Photograph and Hanging Chad are [[Commons|Rarity (Balatro)]], they appear much more frequently in [[the Shop|the Shop (Balatro)]] compared to other Joker combinations. Additionally, their solid Mult scaling can help carry a run.<<hrRequirementshr>>The following requirements are needed to pull off Photochad:;;The Jokers Photograph and Hanging Chad|Many face cards that can be played;;<<hr2Biasing factorshr2>>The following will improve the odds of Photochad working:;;Additional retriggering Jokers ([[Sock and Buskin|Sock and Buskin (Balatro)]], [[Dusk|Dusk (Balatro)]], [[Seltzer]])|[[Showman]] or [[Invisible Joker]] to get additional copies of Photograph or Hanging Chad|[[Blueprint|Blueprint (Balatro)]] or [[Brainstorm|Brainstorm (Balatro)]] to copy Photograph or Hanging Chad|[[Antimatter|Antimatter (Balatro)]] or [[Ectoplasm|Ectoplasm (Balatro)]] to increase the number of usable Jokers|[[Red Seals|Red Seal (Balatro)]] on face cards as an additional trigger for Photograph|Having many face cards, especially when they outnumber [[numbered cards|numbered cards (Balatro)]] and [[Aces|Ace (Balatro)]];;The following will greatly decrease the viability or potentially kill Photochad:;;Relying on numbered cards/Aces for scoring|Having few face cards (such as from the [[Abandoned Deck|Abandoned Deck (Balatro)]])|The [[Boss Blind|Boss Blind (Balatro)]] [[The Plant|The Plant (Balatro)]];;<<hrScoring optimizationhr>>{{tMain page: [[Scoring optimization ({{aiBalatro}})]]}}&sp<<img(src=git/advanced photochad.png(cap=A Photochad with additional Jokers to improve it with optimal setup.img>>For Photochad, the optimal setup has a balance between playing card triggers and Photograph triggers per card trigger. Normally, with just Photograph and Hanging Chad, there would be 3 card triggers (1 normally, 2 from Hanging Chad) and 1 Photograph trigger. To find the final Mult multiplier, follow {{code2{{s-u({{iC{{s-bt}}}} * {{iP{{s-bt}})}}}}}}, where {{iC{{s-bt}}}} is a card trigger and {{iP{{s-bt}}}} is a Photograph trigger. With the most basic Photochad, the Mult multiplier would be {{code2{{s-u(3 * 1)}} = 2{{s-u3}} = 8}}. For example, using 2 Photographs, 1 Hanging Chad, 1 Blueprint, and 1 Brainstorm, the optimal setup is copying 1 Photograph for 3 {{iP{{s-bt}}}} in total and 1 Hanging Chad for 5 {{iC{{s-bt}}}} in total. The Mult multiplier would be {{code2{{s-u(5 * 3)}} = 2{{s-u15}} = 32,768}} for the optimized combination. The following table is a quick reference for how different values for {{iC{{s-bt}}}} (horizontal axis) and {{iP{{s-bt}}}} (vertical axis) impact Mult multiplier, with a balance between {{iC{{s-bt}}}} and {{iP{{s-bt}}}} having a higher Mult multiplier overall:<<table|{{c{{b1}}}}|{{c{{b2}}}}|{{c{{b3}}}}|{{c{{b4}}}}|{{c{{b5}}}}||{{b1}}|{{r2}}|{{r4}}|{{r8}}|{{r16}}|{{r32}}||{{b2}}|{{r4}}|{{r16}}|{{r64}}|{{r256}}|{{r1,024}}||{{b3}}|{{r8}}|{{r64}}|{{r512}}|{{r4,096}}|{{r32,768}}||{{b4}}|{{r16}}|{{r256}}|{{r4,096}}|{{r65,536}}|{{r1,048,576}}||{{b5}}|{{r32}}|{{r1,024}}|{{r32,768}}|{{r1,048,576}}|{{r33,554,432}}table>></div>
