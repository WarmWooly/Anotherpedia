      <div><<shortElementary particle; quantum of electromagnetic energyshort>><<img(src=git/photon.gif(cap=A [[diagram]] of how a photon interacts with [[electrons|electron]] in an [[atom]].img>>A {{bphoton}} is an [[elementary particle]] which is a [[quantum]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[force carrier]] for [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetism]]. Photons are the smallest [[unit]] of [[electromagnetic energy]], which includes [[electromagnetic radiation]] (such as [[light]] and [[UV|Ultraviolet]]). They are considered [[massless|massless particle]],<<note(content=There are intricacies related to the frame of reference and the energy level of the photon, but it is generally used as if it has no mass.(text=noteCountnote>> which means in a [[vacuum]] they will move at the [[speed of light]]. Photons are a part of the [[bosons|boson]]. Photons are explained under [[quantum mechanics]], having a [[wave-particle duality]] (where they can both be a [[wave]] and a [[particle]]) based on [[observation]] (as displayed in the [[Double Slit Experiment]]).</div>
