      <h1>Photon</h1>
      <div>A photon is an elementary particle which is a quantum of the electromagnetic field and the force carrier for electromagnetism. Photons are the smallest unit of electromagnetic energy, which includes electromagnetic radiation (such as light and Ultraviolet). They are considered massless particle, which means in a vacuum they will move at the speed of light. Photons are a part of the boson. Photons are explained under quantum mechanics, having a wave-particle duality (where they can both be a wave and a particle) based on observation (as displayed in the Double Slit Experiment).</div>
