      <h1>Photon</h1>
      <div>A photon is an elementary particle which is a quantum of the electromagnetic field and the force carrier for electromagnetic force. Photons are the smallest unit of electromagnetic energy, which includes electromagnetic radiation (such as light and UV). They are considered massless,<<note(content=There are intricacies related to the frame of reference and the energy level of the photon, but it is generally used as if it has no mass.(text=noteCountnote>> which means in a vacuum they will move at the speed of light. Photons are a part of the bosons. Photons are explained under quantum mechanics, having a wave-particle duality (where they can both be a wave and a particle) based on observation (as displayed in the Double Slit Experiment).</div>
