      <h1>Phrase</h1>
      <div>A phrase is a small group of word as a unit (part), forming part of a clause in a sentence. Phrases can be used to break down sentences and extrapolate meaning (linguistics) of the entire sentence.

There are many different types of phrases, many of which may overlap depending on the phrase. The ten most common phrase types are the noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase, adverb phrase, prepositional phrase, gerund phrase, infinitive phrase, participial phrase, appositive phrase, and absolute phrase.</div>
