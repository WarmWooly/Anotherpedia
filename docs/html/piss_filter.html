      <h1>Piss filter</h1>
      <div>For the yellowing of generative artificial intelligence image, see AI piss filter, and for the filter used in film and TV series, see Mexican filter.<br>The piss filter is slang for warmer color grading and yellow photographic filter used within video game during the 2000s and early-2010s. Notable examples include Resident Evil 5, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The filter tends to be applied in the outdoors within urban areas, possibly resembling smog while giving a sense that an area is run-down. The term is demeaning to represent disdain by players of the filter used in games, with some games getting video game modding to remove the filter.</div>
