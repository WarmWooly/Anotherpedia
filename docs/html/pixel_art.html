  <h1>Pixel art</h1>
  <div><<shortDigital art comprised of pixelsshort>><<img(src=git/pixel art.png(cap=Pixel art of a [[child]] looking at an [[Ampharos]].img>>{{bPixel art}} is [[digital art]] created in a [[graphics software]] that is only comprised of [[pixels|pixel]]. While pixel art was originally used for displaying elements with limited graphical capabilities (such as [[graphing calculators|graphing calculator]] and [[arcade machines|arcade machine]]), it has since branched out as a unique style of [[art]] despite the ability for most [[screens|LED display]] to handle higher-resolution [[images|image]]. While any digital image could be considered pixel art, as it is rendered as pixels, it is commonly associated with the intention to directly work with and manipulate specific pixels to create an artwork.</div>
