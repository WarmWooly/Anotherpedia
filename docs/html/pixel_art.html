      <h1>Pixel art</h1>
      <div>Pixel art is digital art created in a graphics software that is only comprised of pixels. While pixel art was originally used for displaying elements with limited graphical capabilities (such as graphing calculators and arcade machines), it has since branched out as a unique style of art despite the ability for most screens to handle higher-resolution images. While any digital image could be considered pixel art, as it is rendered as pixels, it is commonly associated with the intention to directly work with and manipulate specific pixels to create an artwork.</div>
