  <h1>pKa table</h1>
  <div>A {{bpkA table}} is a reference tool used in chemistry for how basic (chemistry) or acidic (chemistry) a chemical is. A higher pKa represents a more basic chemical, while a lower pKa represents a more acidic chemical. Ka represents the equilibrium constant, where higher Ka means a compound is more able to release Hydrogen Ion, and is thusly more acidic, with a lower Ka making it less acidic due to the decreased H{{s-p+}} ion release. pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka to make it easier to work with the values.</div>
