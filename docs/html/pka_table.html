  <h1>pKa table</h1>
  <div><<shortReference tool for chemical acidityshort>><<img(src=git/pka table.gif(cap=A pKa table from -10 to 50.img>>A {{bpkA table}} is a [[reference tool]] used in [[chemistry]] for how [[basic|basic (chemistry)]] or [[acidic|acidic (chemistry)]] a [[chemical]] is. A higher pKa represents a more basic chemical, while a lower pKa represents a more acidic chemical. Ka represents the [[equilibrium constant]], where higher Ka means a [[compound]] is more able to release [[H{{s-p+}} ions|Hydrogen Ion]], and is thusly more acidic, with a lower Ka making it less acidic due to the decreased H{{s-p+}} ion release. pKa is the [[negative]] [[logarithm]] of Ka to make it easier to work with the values.</div>
