      <h1>Plagiarism</h1>
      <div>Plagiarism is the action of copying work or idea that the plagiarizer did not create, yet to pass it off as their own work or ideas. Plagiarism is almost always considered unethical, where the plagiarizer is often subject to various punishment or sanctions, such as suspension (punishment), expulsion (education) from school or job, fine (penalty), imprisonment, and other penalties. The latter half of the last sentence was plagiarized from Wikipedia page on <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism(text=plagiarismlink>>. Plagiarism is prominent, often exploitation trust of the reader/viewer and of the writer/publisher, in order to achieve a goal (such as wealth or influence).</div>
