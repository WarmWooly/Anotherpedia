      <h1>Planet</h1>
      <div>A planet is a relatively large spherical astronomical object which orbits a star and has cleared its orbit. The planets in the Solar System (from closest to furthest from the Sun) are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Bodies which orbit planets are known as moons. Bodies that do not meet all the requirements to be a planet may be dwarf planets, asteroids, or comets. Planets outside of the Solar System are known as exoplanets.</div>
