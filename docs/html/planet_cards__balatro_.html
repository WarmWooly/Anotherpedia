      <h1>Planet Cards (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Planet Cards are a type of Consumables (Balatro) in Balatro used to upgrade poker hands (Balatro). There are a total of 12 Planet Cards based on the planet in the Solar System and other similar celestial body. These cards increase the chips (Balatro) and multiplier (Balatro) earned with specific hands. They are often the primary way to level up poker hands, and they can be found in The Shop (Balatro) or in booster packs (Balatro). They can also be obtained through the Blue Seal (Balatro), Jokers (Balatro), and from Tags (Balatro). Only 9 are immediately available, with Planet X (Balatro), Ceres (Balatro), and Eris (Balatro) requiring their respective hand to be played and then to purchase the card in the same run (Balatro).<<tableName|Effect||Mercury (Balatro)|Levels up Pair, adding 15 chips and 1 mult.||Venus (Balatro)|Levels up Three of a Kind, adding 20 chips and 2 mult.||Earth (Balatro)|Levels up Full House, adding 25 chips and 2 mult.||Mars (Balatro)|Levels up Four of a Kind, adding 30 chips and 3 mult.||Jupiter (Balatro)|Levels up Flush, adding 15 chips and 2 mult.||Satrun (Balatro)|Levels up Straight, adding 30 chips and 2 mult.||Uranus (Balatro)|Levels up Two Pair, adding 20 chips and 1 mult.||Neptune (Balatro)|Levels up Straight Flush, adding 40 chips and 3 mult.||Pluto (Balatro)|Levels up High Card, adding 10 chips and 1 mult.||Planet X (Balatro)|Levels up Five of a Kind, adding 35 chips and 3 mult.||Ceres (Balatro)|Levels up Flush House, adding 40 chips and 3 mult.||Eris (Balatro)|Levels up Flush Five, adding 40 chips and 3 mult.table>></div>
