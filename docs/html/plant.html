      <h1>Plant</h1>
      <div>Plants are living organisms forming the kingdom Plantae, made up of trees, grasses, mosses, shrubs, and other greenery. Most plants take in water and nutrients through their roots. They also typically use photosynthesis, absorbing sunlight through chloroplasts to turn carbon dioxide in the air and water into sugar. The study of plants is known as botany.</div>
