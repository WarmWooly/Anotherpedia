      <h1>Plant Walking (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
      <div>Plant walking is an effect (Minecraft) in Minecraft modding (Minecraft) Bread Reborn: Redefined that allows the player bone meal (Minecraft) nearby blocks while crouching (Minecraft). The source of plant walking is from eating bone bread (Bread Reborn: Redefined) or a bread platter (Bread Reborn: Redefined) containing such. For each half second a player is crouched, surrounding blocks will be given bone meal. Each time this effect occurs, 3 seconds are removed from the duration of the effect.</div>
