      <h1>Plastic</h1>
      <div>Plastic is used to refer to material mainly comprised of polymer. Because of how easy plastics are to forming and molding, alongside how inexpensive it is to plastic manufacturing in bulk, it has become a staple in the modern world, with hundreds of millions of metric ton of plastic produced annual. They can last for hundreds to thousands of year as they are difficult to be biodegradability.

Main page: Plastic pollution<br>Plastic has become prevalent in single-use packaging, such as disposable bottle, plastic bag, plastic utensils, and plastic wrap, which are then discarded. They are extremely slow to biodegrade, allowing them to remain in the environment. They are harm to animal that plastic consumption it, impact habitat, and can break into smaller and smaller pieces until they become microplastic. The impact of plastic pollution has gone across the entire food chain, where even human may unknowingly consume microplastics from other animals.</div>
