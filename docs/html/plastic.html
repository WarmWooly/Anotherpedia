      <h1>Plastic</h1>
      <div>Plastic is used to refer to materials mainly comprised of polymers. Because of how easy plastics are to form and mold, alongside how inexpensive it is to manufacture in bulk, it has become a staple in the modern world, with hundreds of millions of metric tons of plastic produced annually. They can last for hundreds to thousands of years as they are difficult to be broken down.

Main page: Plastic pollution<br>Plastic has become prevalent in single-use packaging, such as bottles, bags, utensils, and wrapping, which are then discarded. They are extremely slow to biodegrade, allowing them to remain in the environment. They are harmful to animals that consume it, impact habitats, and can break into smaller and smaller pieces until they become microplastics. The impact of plastic pollution has gone across the entire food chain, where even humans may unknowingly consume microplastics from other animals.</div>
