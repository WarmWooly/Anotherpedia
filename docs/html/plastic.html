  <div><<shortModern synthetic polymer-based materialshort>><<img(src=git/plastic.jpg(cap=Several flattened plastic bottles.img>>{{bPlastic}} is used to refer to [[materials|material]] mainly comprised of [[polymers|polymer]]. Because of how easy plastics are to [[form|forming]] and [[mold|molding]], alongside how [[inexpensive]] it is to [[manufacture|plastic manufacturing]] in [[bulk]], it has become a staple in the [[modern world]], with hundreds of millions of [[metric tons|metric ton]] of plastic produced [[annually|annual]]. They can last for hundreds to thousands of [[years|year]] as they are difficult to be [[broken down|biodegradability]].<<hrPollutionhr>>{{tMain page: [[Plastic pollution]]}}&spPlastic has become prevalent in [[single-use packaging]], such as [[bottles|disposable bottle]], [[bags|plastic bag]], [[utensils|plastic utensils]], and [[wrapping|plastic wrap]], which are then discarded. They are extremely slow to [[biodegrade]], allowing them to remain in the [[environment]]. They are [[harmful|harm]] to [[animals|animal]] that [[consume|plastic consumption]] it, impact [[habitats|habitat]], and can break into smaller and smaller pieces until they become [[microplastics|microplastic]]. The impact of plastic pollution has gone across the entire [[food chain]], where even [[humans|human]] may unknowingly consume microplastics from other animals.</div>
