      <h1>Platypet</h1>
      <div>Platypet is a platypus-like Water and Toxic type Temtem.
Platypet resembles a small child in stature and a platypus in features. Its fur is light blue, with a white belly and two dark blue stripes perpendicular to its back. Platypet has stubby hands and feet, each with three digits. It has a large, flat, black tail, often pointing upwards. Platypet's head is comprised of two large, black eyes, two small black markings to the lower side of the eyes, a large black bill, two spikey fur tufts on the top of its head, and three bulbous fur tufts on each side of its head.&pPlatypet's official size is 2 ft and 9 in, while weighing 105.8 lbs. Luma Platypets have orange eyes, a pink coat, and a magenta shading. Umbra Platypets are completely black with bright purple eyes and purple shading.&pPlatypet is a portmanteau between platypus and pet.
In Temtem, Platypet was popularized with kids in an in-universe children's cartoon. The cartoon was made to educate that Toxic Temtems were as friendly and valid as other types of Temtems.
A Platypet has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Platypet is the 7th Temtem in the Tempedia.&pPlatypet evolves into Platox after gaining 20 levels, and then into Platimous after an addition 20 levels.</div>
