      <h1>Player (Attack of the Roombas)</h1>
      <div>The player is the player character in Attack of the Roombas. The player is covered in mud, attracting all the Roombas in the room with the player. The player's only defensive option is to throw rubber balls at the Roombas to destroy them. If the player is touched by a Roomba, a trap, or a rubber ball launched by a Roomba, they instantly lose. The player's goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding contact with Roombas.</div>
