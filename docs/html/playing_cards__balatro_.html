  <h1>Playing cards (Balatro)</h1>
  <div>{{bPlaying cards}}, or more simply {{bcards}}, are cards in {{iBalatro}} that are used to play poker hands (Balatro). Playing cards are based on the standard 52-card deck most used today, containing a total of 52 unique cards. These cards are split into four suit (Balatro): Spades (Balatro) &spadeSuit, Hearts (Balatro) &heartSuit, Clubs (Balatro) &clubSuit, and Diamonds (Balatro) &diamondSuit, each taking up 13 cards. They also are divided by their ranks (Balatro) of 2 (Balatro), 3 (Balatro), 4 (Balatro), 5 (Balatro), 6 (Balatro), 7 (Balatro), 8 (Balatro), 9 (Balatro), 10 (Balatro), Jack (Balatro), Queen (Balatro), King (Balatro), and Ace (Balatro), with 4 of each rank present in the deck. These ranks can be grouped into numbered cards (Balatro) (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10), face cards (Balatro) (Jack, Queen, and King), and Aces. They are the primary way of interacting with the gameplay loop of {{iBalatro}}, used to play poker hands to score Chips (Balatro) to progress the game.&pPlaying cards are the core aspect of deck building that is used to advance the game, with various means. This may include using the Card Booster Packs (Balatro) (known as Standard Packs) to directly add cards to the deck (Balatro), alter, remove, and create cards using Tarot Cards (Balatro) and Spectral Cards (Balatro), or change cards using various Jokers (Balatro). Playing cards can be given various buffs and effects to increase their value in a played hand, known as Modifiers (Balatro), including Editions (Balatro), Enhancements (Balatro), and Seals (Balatro). Only one of each type of Modifier may be present on a card. Different Decks will have various amounts of cards, with examples of the Abandoned Deck (Balatro) having no face cards, the Checkered Deck (Balatro) having 26 Spades and 26 Hearts, and the Erratic Deck (Balatro) having random suits and ranks.
Playing cards are drawn into the hand (Balatro) to be used, which has a standard of 8 drawn cards. Up to 5 cards can be played or discards (Balatro) at once, with each card adding to the Chips used in scoring when played. Cards have a base chip value added to the Chips when played following this table:<<table{{bCard}}|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|Jack|Queen|King|Ace||{{bChip value}}|{{c2}}|{{c3}}|{{c4}}|{{c5}}|{{c6}}|{{c7}}|{{c8}}|{{c9}}|{{c10}}|{{c10}}|{{c10}}|{{c10}}|{{c11}}table>>&spCards with higher chip values are the associated with having a higher value, but this is dependant on the type of cards valued as determined by different Jokers. A player with a Walkie Talkie (Balatro) will find 4s and 10s as more valuable because they add an additional 10 Chips and 4 Mult per 10 or 4 played. Suits do not have any benefit compared to other suits without Jokers. A player who has a Wrathful Joker would seek out Spades as each played card of Spades would add 3 Mult. The following are examples of different hands with playing cards under different conditions:<<table{{bCards used}}|{{bHand played}}|{{bJokers used}}|{{bBase scoring|{{bCard scoring}}|{{bJoker scoring|{{bOther info}}|{{bTotal score}}||9 &heartSuit, 9 &diamondSuit, 5 &spadeSuit, 5 &heartSuit, 5 &clubSuit|Lvl. 1 Full House|None|40 Chips, 4 Mult|33 Chips|N/A|N/A|{{r292}}||King &spadeSuit, 9 &spadeSuit, 8 &spadeSuit, 6 &spadeSuit, 5 &spadeSuit|Lvl. 1 Flush|None|35 Chips, 4 Mult|38 Chips|N/A|1 Steel Card (Balatro)|{{r825}}||King &heartSuit, 8 &heartSuit, 7 &heartSuit, 5 &heartSuit, 3 &heartSuit|Lvl. 1 Flush|Lusty Joker|35 Chips, 4 Mult|33 Chips|15 Mult|N/A|{{r1292}}||Jack &heartSuit, 10 &spadeSuit, 9 &heartSuit, 8 &heartSuit, 7 &spadeSuit|Lvl. 2 Straight|Lusty Joker, Walkie Talkie|60 Chips, 7 Mult|44 Chips|10 Chips, 13 Mult|N/A|{{r2388}}table>></div>
