      <h1>Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|640||Enchantability (Minecraft)|2--8||Attack damage (Minecraft)|2||Attack speed (Minecraft)|1||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Pliers are a type of item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail. There are three tiers of pliers: iron pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail), rose gold pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail), and iron composite pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Iron pliers can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 iron ingot (Minecraft), 1 planks (Minecraft), and 2 stick (Minecraft) (place the planks in the middle, then the iron above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left). Rose gold pliers replace the iron ingots with 2 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail) and the planks with a block of rose gold chains (Not Lazy Chainmail). Iron composite pliers use 2 iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 block of iron composite (Not Lazy Chainmail), and replaced the sticks with 2 obsidian (Minecraft).

The chances to find pliers in chest (Minecraft) are the following:<br>In a chainmailler home (Not Lazy Chainmail), a chest has a 91% chance to contain iron pliers (36% chance for it to be enchantment (Minecraft)) and a 51% chance to contain rose gold pliers (19% chance for it to be enchantment (Minecraft)).



Hold the pliers in the offhand (Minecraft) with the coil or unfinished project to be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) in the main hand (Minecraft). When using the pliers, it creates one, two, or four chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type based on the tier of pliers (iron --> rose gold --> iron composite). When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.

The Auto Snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting pliers, an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.

Pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 tick (Minecraft)).

Pliers can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining pliers of the same type will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the pliers, costing experience.

Pliers can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).

Multiple runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast onto pliers:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3 levels|I||Dampen Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Dampened (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|I||Muffle Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Muffled (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|Itable>></div>
