      <h1>Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|64||Enchantability|2--8||Attack damage|2||Attack speed|1||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Noinfo>>Pliers are a type of item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. There are three tiers of pliers: iron, rose gold, and iron composite.



Iron pliers can be crafted with 2 iron ingots, 1 plank, and 2 sticks (place the planks in the middle, then the iron above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left). Rose gold pliers replace the iron ingots with 2 rose gold ingots and the planks with a block of rose gold chains. Iron composite pliers use 2 iron composite ingots, 1 block of iron composite, and replaced the sticks with 2 obsidian.

The chances to find pliers in chests are the following:<br>In a chainmailler home, a chest has a 91% chance to contain iron pliers (36% chance for it to be enchanted) and a 51% chance to contain rose gold pliers (19% chance for it to be enchanted).



Hold the pliers in the offhand with the coil or unfinished project to be snipped in the main hand. When using the pliers, it creates one, two, or four chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type based on the tier of pliers (iron --> rose gold --> iron composite). When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.

The Auto Snipper is a block that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting pliers, an industrial belt, and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.

Pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 ticks).

Pliers can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining pliers of the same type will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the pliers, costing experience.

Pliers can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, and Curse of Vanishing, using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

The rune Automated Permanence Rune can be cast on pliers to give Automated Permanence (unbreakable), costing 2 levels.</div>
