      <div><<shortSnipping item type in {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}}short>><<info<<img(src=git/pliers nlc.png(cap=The pliers.img>>||{{bStats}}||{{b[[Rarity|Rarity (Minecraft)]]}}|Common||{{b[[Stack size|Stack size (Minecraft)]]}}|1||{{b[[Durability|Durability (Minecraft)]]}}|64||{{b[[Enchantability|Enchantability (Minecraft)]]}}|2--8||{{b[[Attack damage|Attack damage (Minecraft)]]}}|2||{{b[[Attack speed|Attack speed (Minecraft)]]}}|1||{{b[[Fire/lava &spesistance|Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)]]}}|Noinfo>>{{bPliers}} are a type of [[item|item (Minecraft)]] in the {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[mod|mod (Minecraft)]] {{i[[Not Lazy Chainmail]]}}. There are three tiers of pliers: [[iron|iron pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], [[rose gold|rose gold pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and [[iron composite|iron composite pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]].<<hrObtaininghr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>Iron pliers can be [[crafted|crafting (Minecraft)]] with 2 [[iron ingots|iron ingot (Minecraft)]], 1 [[plank|planks (Minecraft)]], and 2 [[sticks|stick (Minecraft)]] (place the planks in the middle, then the iron above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left). Rose gold pliers replace the iron ingots with 2 [[rose gold ingots|rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] and the planks with a [[block of rose gold chains|block of rose gold chains (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]. Iron composite pliers use 2 [[iron composite ingots|iron composite ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], 1 [[block of iron composite|block of iron composite (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and replaced the sticks with 2 [[obsidian|obsidian (Minecraft)]].<<hr2Chest loothr2>>The chances to find pliers in [[chests|chest (Minecraft)]] are the following:&spIn a [[chainmailler home|chainmailler home (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], a chest has a 91% chance to contain iron pliers (36% chance for it to be [[enchanted|enchantment (Minecraft)]])<<note(content=The chainmailler home has a double chest, both rolling [[loot tables|loot table (Minecraft)]] with 1 roll that contains a 7 in 10 chance to select iron pliers (2 in 10, or 1 in 5, for enchanted). The chance for at least 1 pair of iron pliers to be inside the double chest is calculated as {{code1 - (3/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91}} ({{code1 - (8/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36}} for enchanted).(text=noteCountnote>> and a 51% chance to contain rose gold pliers (19% chance for it to be [[enchanted|enchantment (Minecraft)]]).<<note(content=The chainmailler home has a double chest, both rolling loot tables with 1 roll that contains a 3 in 10 chance to select rose gold pliers (1 in 10 for enchanted). The chance for at least 1 pair of rose gold pliers to be inside the double chest is calculated as {{code1 - (7/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51}} ({{code1 - (9/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19}} for enchanted).(text=noteCountnote>><<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Snippinghr2>>Hold the pliers in the [[offhand|offhand (Minecraft)]] with the coil or unfinished project to be [[snipped|snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] in the [[main hand|main hand (Minecraft)]]. When using the pliers, it creates one, two, or four chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type based on the tier of pliers (iron --> rose gold --> iron composite). When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.<<hr3Auto snipperhr3>>The [[Auto Snipper|Auto Snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] is a [[block|block (Minecraft)]] that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting pliers, an [[industrial belt|industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.<<hr2Weaponhr2>>Pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 [[ticks|tick (Minecraft)]]).<<hr2Repairinghr2>>Pliers can be repaired through [[combining|combining (Minecraft)]] by [[crafting|crafting (Minecraft)]], using a [[grindstone|grindstone (Minecraft)]], or using an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]]. Combining pliers of the same type will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some [[experience|experience (Minecraft)]] returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the pliers, costing experience.<<hr2Enchantinghr2>>Pliers can be [[enchanted|enchanting (Minecraft)]] with [[Unbreaking|Unbreaking (Minecraft)]], [[Mending|Mending (Minecraft)]], and [[Curse of Vanishing|Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft)]], using an [[enchanted book|enchanted book (Minecraft)]] on an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]]. Unbreaking may also be obtained in an [[enchanting table|enchanting table (Minecraft)]].<<hr2Rune castinghr2>>The [[rune|runes (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] [[Automated Permanence Rune|Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be cast on pliers to give [[Automated Permanence|Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (unbreakable), costing 2 [[levels|experience (Minecraft)]].</div>
