  <div><<shortEpisode from {{iBunny Maloney}}short>><<img(src=git/polterabbitgeist.png(cap=The [[title card]] for "Polterabbitgeist".img>>"{{bPoulterabbitgeist}}" ([[French|French language]]: "{{bNos ancêtres les lapins}}") is an episode from the 2009 [[animated cartoon]] [[TV series]] {{i[[Bunny Maloney]]}}. It was [[written|writing]] by [[Dave Fouracre]] and [[Dylan Owen]]. The [[storyboard supervisor]] for the episode was [[Florian Ferrier]], with the [[storyboard]] created by [[Pierre Varlan]] and [[Florent Poulain]]. [[Bunny|Bunny Maloney (character)]] and [[Candy|Candy Bunny (Bunny Maloney)]] argue over ownership of their [[apartment]] as [[Professor Débilouman|Professor Débilouman (Bunny Maloney)]] and [[Modchi|Modchi (Bunny Maloney)]] pretend to be bunny ancestors to mess with them.<<hrPlothr>>A [[crew|TV crew]] from a [[reality TV show]] {{iPerfect Homes}} films the interior of the [[ProtecTeam|ProtecTeam (Bunny Maloney)]]'s [[apartment]], with Candy posing as the camera pans over her. One of the men inquires about the cost of buying the apartment from ProtecTeam, with Candy becoming outraged at the prospect and throwing the crew out. She then opens up a [[closet]] to let out Bunny, [[Jean-François|Jean-François (Bunny Maloney)]], [[Potchi|Potchi (Bunny Maloney)]], and [[Ben|Ben (Bunny Maloney)]], with Jean-François and Ben upset as Bunny argues with Candy about his [[fish|Bunny's fish (Bunny Maloney)]] needing to be fed. Bunny was also angered at being forced to hide from the TV crew in the closet. Candy retorts with the fact that she designed the apartment while saying that Bunny only cares about his [[aquarium]] and the large [[TV]] he got from [[Stan|Stan Ookie (Bunny Maloney)]].&pCandy, Potchi, and Jean-François sit on their sofa watching the [[news|Television news]] discussing an [[ancient bunny civilization|ancient civilization]] being found. Candy beckons Bunny to eat his dinner, with Bunny arguing that he doesn't want to leave a mark on her "perfect" sofa, leading Candy to feed a portion of it to Potchi. Candy convinces Bunny to leave his fish tank to finish the rest of his dinner. The news cuts out, with a voice from the TV claiming to be the bunny [[ancestors]] asking for help from beyond the grave. Candy and Jean-François freak out, with Bunny unplugging the TV. After it turns on again while unplugged, directing Candy and Bunny to help the ancestors, they all panic as Stan's [[hologram]] asks what is going on.&pIt cuts to Débilouman's [[submarine]] with Débilouman and Modchi [[maniacally]] laughing about how easy it was to start their plan. Débilouman calls his [[spies|The Amazing Secret Spies (Bunny Maloney)]] to "move to phase 2" as Bunny and Candy argue about who should ask the ancestors about what to do. After Candy stops Bunny from leaving, Bunny suggests that they perform an [[exorcism]]. The ProtecTeam dance and sing while calling the ancestors to go toward the light as Débilouman and Modchi watch in glee. Débilouman commands his spies to use an [[anti-gravity]] gun on the apartment, causing the team to float out onto the street. The spies return to a [[blimp]] above the apartment, dropping the anti-gravity gun in the process, which the ProtecTeam grabs. Following the ProtecTeam's [[transformation scene]] into their [[mech|ProtecTeam's mech (Bunny Maloney)]], they fly over to Débilouman's submarine. Candy uses the anti-gravity gun to drop the submarine high in the air, sinking on impact with the water. In the end, Candy and Bunny agree that they equally share ownership of the apartment.</div>
