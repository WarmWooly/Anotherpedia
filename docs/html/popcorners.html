      <h1>PopCorners</h1>
      <div>PopCorners are popped corn chips in the shape of a triangle that are made of cornmeal, sunflower oil and seasoning. PopCorners come in a wide variety of flavors, such as white cheddar, sea salt, kettle corn, spicy queso, sour cream & onion, sweet chili, and cinnamon crunch. PopCorners are owned by PepsiCo.
There was an advertismemt with Breaking Bad for PopCorners, notably the white cheddar flavor, broadcast during the Super Bowl. It uses iconic characters, phrases and locations from Breaking Bad as they substitute drugs with PopCorners. They often break the ad up into 15 second chunks for wider broadcasting, such as on YouTube. The original ad has since been taken down from YouTube, but reuploads still allow for the ad to be accessed.</div>
