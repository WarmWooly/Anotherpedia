  <h1>Portable Pixmap</h1>
  <div>{{bPortable pixmap}} (.ppm) is an image file format that is used by Netpbm. In a .ppm file, it starts with, what is often referred to as, a "magic number", starting with P and ending with a number, which for a .ppm file would be P3. The file extension does not matter, as any of the magic numbers could be substituted and still work, yet it is best practice to use the correct file extension.
The file first starts with the magic number and is then followed by whitespace. After the break, a number in ASCII is put in for the image's width, followed by whitespace, and then height, and then another break is added to put in the maximum color value. Afterward, for every pixel, a 3-number combination is input, between 0 - the maximum set. A line can only go for 70 character (computer programming). comment (computer programming) can be added with a hashtag. An example of a file would look like:
The file can also be stored in a smaller, compacted version. The magic number used is P6, storing all the values in byte. Whitespace cannot be used in the pixel area, and the maximum color value it can be set to is 255.</div>
