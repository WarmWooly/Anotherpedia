      <div><<shortNetpbm image file formatshort>><<img(src=git/oil platform.ppm(cap=A .ppm of an [[oil platform]].img>>{{bPortable pixmap}} (.ppm) is an [[image]] [[file format]] that is used by [[Netpbm]]. In a .ppm file, it starts with, what is often referred to as, a "magic number", starting with P and ending with a [[number]], which for a .ppm file would be P3. The [[file extension]] does not matter, as any of the magic numbers could be substituted and still work, yet it is best practice to use the correct file extension.<<hrFile datahr>>The file first starts with the magic number and is then followed by [[whitespace]]. After the break, a number in [[ASCII]] is put in for the image's [[width]], followed by whitespace, and then [[height]], and then another break is added to put in the maximum color value. Afterward, for every pixel, a 3-number combination is input, between 0 - the maximum set. A line can only go for 70 [[characters|character (computer programming)]]. [[Comments|comment (computer programming)]] can be added with a [[#|hashtag]]. An example of a file would look like:<<codeP3 # The "magic number"&sp4 4 # The width and height&sp15 # The color maximum, between 0-15 in this case&sp0 15 0&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 9 6&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 6 9&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 0 15 # The first 4 pixels&sp0 15 0&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 9 6&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 6 9&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 0 15&sp0 15 0&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 9 6&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 6 9&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 0 15&sp0 15 0&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 9 6&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 6 9&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp0 0 15&sp# This makes a green to blue gradient from left to rightcode>><<hr2RAWBITShr2>>The file can also be stored in a smaller, compacted version. The magic number used is P6, storing all the values in [[bytes|byte]]. Whitespace cannot be used in the pixel area, and the maximum color value it can be set to is 255.</div>
