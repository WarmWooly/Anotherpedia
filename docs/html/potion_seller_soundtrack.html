      <h1>Potion Seller Soundtrack</h1>
      <div>"Potion Seller Soundtrack" is a YouTube song made by Producer Ocean on December 1, 2015. It features Producer Ocean acting out a pair of character, a potion seller and a traveller, as they argue about potion. Producer Ocean vocoding the conversation over music and uses a filter to change the proportions of his face based on his distance to the camera.

[Traveller] Hello, potion seller. I am going into battle, and I want your strongest potions.<br><br>[Potion Seller] My potions are too strong for you, traveller.<br><br>[Traveller] Potion seller, I tell you I'm going into battle, and I want only your strongest potions.<br><br>[Potion Seller] You can't handle my potions. They're too strong for you.<br><br>[Traveller] Potion seller, listen to me. I want only your strongest potions.<br><br>[Potion Seller] My potions will kill you, traveller. You cannot handle my potions.<br><br>[Traveller] Potion seller, enough of these games. I'm going into battle, and I need your strongest potions.<br><br>[Potion Seller] My strongest potions will kill you, traveller. You can't handle my strongest potions. You better go to a seller that sells weaker potions!<br><br>[Traveller] Potion seller, I'm telling you right now, I'm going into battle, and I need only your strongest potions.<br><br>[Potion Seller] You don't know what you ask, traveller. My strongest potions will kill a dragon, let alone a man! You need a seller that sells weaker potions, because my potions are too strong!<br><br>[Traveller] Potion seller, I'm telling you, I need your strongest potions. I'm going into battle! I'm going to battle, and I need your strongest potions!<br><br>[Potion Seller] You can't handle my strongest potions! No one can! My strongest potions aren't fit for a beast, let alone a man!<br><br>[Traveller] Potion seller, what do I have to tell you to get your potions? Why won't you trust me with your strongest potions? Potion seller, I need them if I'm to be successful in the battle.<br><br>[Potion Seller] I can't give you my strongest potions because my strongest potions are only for the strongest beings, and you are of the weakest.<br><br>[Traveller] Well, then, that's it, potion seller. I'll go elsewhere. I'll go elsewhere for my potions.<br><br>[Potion Seller] That's what you'd better do! <br><br>[Traveller] I'll go elsewhere for my potions, and I'll never come back!<br><br>[Potion Seller] Good! You're not welcome here. My potions are only for the strongest, and you're clearly are not of the strongest. You're clearly the weakest.<br><br>[Traveller] You've had your say, potion seller, but I'll have mine. You're a rascal! You're a rascal with no respect for knights! No respect for anything, except your potions!<br><br>[Potion Seller] Why respect knights, when my potions can do anything that you can?</div>
