  <h1>Pouchy ({{iInside Out 2}})</h1>
  <div><<shortMinor supporting character in {{iInside Out 2}}short>>{{tThis page contains [[spoilers|spoiler]] for the movie {{ai[[Inside Out 2]]}}.}}&sp<<img(src=git/pouchy io2.png(cap=Pouchy.img>>{{bPouchy}} is a [[minor character]] from a fictional [[children's show]] {{iBloofy's House}} from the back of [[Riley's|Riley (Inside Out)]] mind that helps the Emotions ([[Joy|Joy (Inside Out)]], [[Sadness|Sadness (Inside Out)]], [[Fear|Fear (Inside Out)]], [[Disgust|Disgust (Inside Out)]], and [[Anger|Anger (Inside Out)]]) in {{i[[Inside Out 2]]}}.<<hrDesignhr>>Pouchy resembles a [[fanny pack]], having a yellow coloration across his entire body. His eyes rest at the top of the pack and his mouth is behind his zipper. Pouchy can freely open and close his zippered mouth without touching the zipper. He also has a simple [[buckle strap]] that he uses to wrap around to be worn as a fanny pack.<<hrAppearanceshr>>Pouchy first appears in {{iInside Out 2}} as the Emotions are trapped in the Vault after being locked away by [[Anxiety|Anxiety (Inside Out 2)]]. [[Bloofy|Bloofy (Inside Out 2)]], who is also trapped in the Vault, agrees to help the Emotions out, and asks the audience to call Pouchy by saying "Oh Pouchy!" Pouchy then springs to life off of Bloofy's waist and lists off three items that can be used reminiscent to {{i[[Micky Mouse Clubhouse's|Micky Mouse Clubhouse]]}} [[Toodles|Toodles (Micky Mouse Clubhouse)]], with Anger grabbing the stick of [[dynamite]] and igniting it to escape the vault.&pThe Emotions (without Sadness) make it to the pile of [[Memory Orbs|Memory Orb (Inside Out)]] launched to the back of the mind, but their plan to return to [[Headquarters|Headquarters (Inside Out)]] is foiled when Anxiety destroys the pipe to recall them back. Anger, to his own dismay, calls Pouchy with the aid of the three others to ask for help. Pouchy lists two mundane items before Anger forcibly shoves his arm into Pouchy to extract several bundles of dynamite. Disgust asks Pouchy for a more useful item, which angers Pouchy as he's offered what he has in him. They cut to having enough dynamite to knock over the mountain of orbs that causes an avalanche toward Headquarters.&pAt the end of the film, Pouchy interrupts the Emotions in Headquarters, who is wrapped around Anger's body. Anger calls for [[confetti]] from Pouchy, which he spits out of his mouth, hitting Fear in the face twice.</div>
