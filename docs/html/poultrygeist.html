The [[description]] for the book is as follows:<<quo{{bFrom a debut picture-book author and a #1 New York Times best-selling illustrator, a wry take on "Why did the chicken cross the road?” that gives a whole new meaning to “the Other Side.” Cock-a-doodle-BOO!}}&pIt’s punny. It’s spooky. It’s a meta picture book that puts a fresh spin on an old joke and elevates chicken comedy to ghastly new levels. A little spring chicken crosses the road but quickly gets flattened under a semitruck. The barnyard beasts who’ve gone before break the news: now that Chicken’s fried—dispatched to the Other Side—Chicken has a job, an unwanted job, as a noisy troublemaking ghost. This fowl may be weak in the beak, but Chicken knows that scaring people isn’t nice. There is such a thing as a friendly ghost, after all—isn’t there? Loaded with laughs and shivers, this Halloween-ready treat features ghoulishly funny art by the illustrator of the #1 {{iNew York Times}} best-selling Bad Seed series. Let the haunting begin!&p{{iNo chickens were harmed in the making of this book.}}quo>><<hrReviewshr>><<AsofJune 2025>>, this book has a rating of 4.6/5 stars on [[Amazon|Amazon (company)]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.amazon.com/Poultrygeist-Eric-Geron/dp/1536210501(text=refCountref>> Here are a few ratings:&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Readerella, United States on December 9, 2021&sp{{bSpooktacular!}}&spBeautiful illustrations and hilarious story! As you can tell from the title, lots of clever puns make this book a fun read for both my child and myself. Tweet yourself...I mean, treat!&p⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Pop Bop, United States on August 22, 2021&sp{{bCharming; But Who is This For?}}&spThis book is a total hoot - with an appealing chicken hero, a clever premise, and witty puns. The setup is simple enough. A chicken is crossing the road and is flattened by an oncoming truck. Instead of getting to the other side he wakes up on "the other side". Our ghost chicken wants to be a good ghost, but the ghosts of all the other road kill want it to be a scary ghost. What a fine twist on an old joke. Engagingly drawn and fast paced.&pBut who is this for? Reflecting on our little guys, one would be creeped out, one would think it hilarious, one would be indifferent, and the littlest would run around the house for days pretending to be road kill. I sort of like the idea of this just as an experiment before moving on to more ghoulish treats. (After all, the chicken is pretty friendly.) And I often think we don't give kids enough credit for being able to take a joke. But I'd still probably not choose this for bedtime.&p(Please note that I received a free advance will-self-destruct-in-x-days Adobe Digital copy of this book without a review requirement, or any influence regarding review content should I choose to post a review. Apart from that I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book.)&p⭐ - maryk, United States on August 24, 2021&sp{{bkinda weird}}&spDead animals live in a ghost world to be vicious.
