Upon crafting, the [[advancement|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Mechanized Milling|Mechanized Milling (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] will be awarded.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Craftinghr2>>Powered millstones are used in the following crafting recipes:&sp[[Refined Millstone|Refined Millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] - 1 powered millstone, 2 [[blaze rods|blaze rod (Minecraft)]], 1 [[diamond|diamond (Minecraft)]], and 2 [[obsidian|obsidian (Minecraft)]] (place the millstone in the center, the diamond below, an rod above, the obsidian in the bottom corners, and a rod in the top-left corner).<<hr2Millinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined}})]]}}&spTo use the powered millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the [[main hand|main hand (Minecraft)]]. Upon interacting with the powered millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the powered millstone is powered, up to 4 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete [[hunger|hunger (Minecraft)]]. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. The powered millstone can be [[muted|mute]] when placed on [[wool|wool (Minecraft)]]. With an open hand, the powered millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while [[sneaking|sneaking (Minecraft)]].<<hr2Redstonehr2>>When powered, the powered millstone will rotate once, processing up to 4 [[items|Item (Minecraft entity)]] above it. If the block below it is open, the produced [[flour|flours (Bread Reborn: Redefined)]] will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the powered millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a [[hopper|hopper (Minecraft)]].<<hr3Redstone signalhr3>>A [[redstone comparator]] can read a powered millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the powered millstone is from its resting position.<<note(content=Internally, the powered millstone is considered a container with a single item slot with a max stack size of 7.
