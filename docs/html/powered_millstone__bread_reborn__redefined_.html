It is the middle tier of the millstones (Bread Reborn: Redefined).
A powered millstone can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined), 2 iron ingot (Minecraft), 2 redstone dust (Minecraft), and 1 redstone torch (Minecraft) (place the millstone in the center, the torch below, an iron ingot above, the dust in the bottom corners, and an iron ingot in the top-left corner). Upon crafting, the advancement (Minecraft) Mechanized Milling (Bread Reborn: Redefined) will be awarded.
Powered millstones are used in the following crafting recipes:&spRefined Millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined) - 1 powered millstone, 2 blaze rod (Minecraft), 1 diamond (Minecraft), and 2 obsidian (Minecraft) (place the millstone in the center, the diamond below, an rod above, the obsidian in the bottom corners, and a rod in the top-left corner).
{{tMain page: Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined}})}}&spTo use the powered millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the main hand (Minecraft). Upon interacting with the powered millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the powered millstone is powered, up to 4 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete hunger (Minecraft). When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. The powered millstone can be mute when placed on wool (Minecraft). With an open hand, the powered millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while sneaking (Minecraft).
When powered, the powered millstone will rotate once, processing up to 4 Item (Minecraft entity) above it. If the block below it is open, the produced flours (Bread Reborn: Redefined) will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the powered millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a hopper (Minecraft).
A redstone comparator can read a powered millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the powered millstone is from its resting position.<<note(content=Internally, the powered millstone is considered a container with a single item slot with a max stack size of 7. For each of the rotated states, 1--7 placeholder rotatium (Bread Reborn: Redefined) are stored to trigger the comparator.(text=noteCountnote>> The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<table{{bState}}|{{bDeg}}|{{bSignal}}||0|{{r0&deg}}|{{r0}}||1|{{r45&deg}}|{{r3}}||2|{{r90&deg}}|{{r5}}||3|{{r135&deg}}|{{r7}}||4|{{r180&deg}}|{{r9}}||5|{{r225&deg}}|{{r11}}||6|{{r270&deg}}|{{r13}}||7|{{r315&deg}}|{{r15}}table>></div>
