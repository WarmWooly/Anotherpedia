      <h1>Powered Millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|8||Hardness|3||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Waterloggable|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The powered millstone is a block in the Minecraft mod Bread Reborn: Redefined used in milling items. It is the middle tier of the millstones.



A powered millstone can be crafted with 1 millstone, 2 iron ingots, 2 redstone dust, and 1 redstone torch (place the millstone in the center, the torch below, an iron ingot above, the dust in the bottom corners, and an iron ingot in the top-left corner). Upon crafting, the advancement Mechanized Milling will be awarded.



Powered millstones are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Refined Millstone - 1 powered millstone, 2 blaze rods, 1 diamond, and 2 obsidian (place the millstone in the center, the diamond below, an rod above, the obsidian in the bottom corners, and a rod in the top-left corner).

Main page: Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined)}}<br>To use the powered millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the main hand. Upon interacting with the powered millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the powered millstone is powered, up to 4 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete hunger. When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. The powered millstone can be muted when placed on wool. With an open hand, the powered millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while sneaking.

When powered, the powered millstone will rotate once, processing up to 4 items above it. If the block below it is open, the produced flour will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the powered millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a hopper.

A redstone comparator can read a powered millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the powered millstone is from its resting position. The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<tableState|Deg|Signal||0|r0&deg|r0||1|r45&deg|r3||2|r90&deg|r5||3|r135&deg|r7||4|r180&deg|r9||5|r225&deg|r11||6|r270&deg|r13||7|r315&deg|r15table>></div>
