      <h1>Powerscaling</h1>
      <div>Powerscaling or power scaling is the process of determining the fighting capability of fiction character to attempt to determine the outcome between a fight, especially in manga and anime. Powerscaling is a type of fan work either within one or between fandom. Powerscaling relies on canon feat of strength, skill, and/or wit, widely-held fanon (fiction), and through previous determined powerscaling results. For example, if character A has been shown to beat character B, and character B is much stronger than character C, it is likely that character A would beat character C. A person who powerscales is a powerscaler.</div>
