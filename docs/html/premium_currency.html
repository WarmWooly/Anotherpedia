      <h1>Premium currency</h1>
      <div>Premium currency is an in-game currency that usually requires real-life money to obtain it. These are almost exclusively separate from normal currencies, and are either greatly difficult to impossible to obtain without using money. A common symbol for premium currencies are gems or crystals. These currencies may also be earned in games by watching ads or downloading and playing other games.<br><br>Premium currencies could be used either to speed up progress, be used as a substitute for normal currency, or may be the only way to purchase something in-game. Premium currencies are often used to blur the lines between the exact amount of money spent and what the user is purchasing.</div>
