      <h1>Private browsing</h1>
      <div>Private browsing, also known as InPrivate Browsing or Incognito Mode, is a built-in method in web browsers to allow the user to make searches without the search query saving to their search history. It is important to note that this does not encrypt the queries, and data of the searches will always be saved to devices such as routers, which they need to be able to access to let the search go through.<br><br>Private browsing is synonymous with the Dark Web due to the secretive nature of private browsing.</div>
