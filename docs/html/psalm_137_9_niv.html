      <h1>Psalm 137:9 NIV</h1>
      <div>In the New International Version of the 5th book of Psalms, in chapter 137, the 9th verse reads:Blessed the one who seizes your children<br>and smashes them against the rock.The meaning behind this verse is that for the total eradication of an enemy to be fulfilled, you must kill all those who could grow up and become your enemy. A person who kills all children will have fully prevented the possibility of their inaction to harm them or their kind in the future.</div>
