      <h1>Psalm 137:9 NIV</h1>
      <div>In the New International Version of the 5th book of Psalms, in chapter 137, the 9th verse reads:The meaning behind this verse is that for the total eradication of an enemy to be fulfilled, you must kill all those who could grow up and become your enemy. A person who kills all children will have fully prevented the possibility of their inaction to harm them or their kind in the future.</div>
