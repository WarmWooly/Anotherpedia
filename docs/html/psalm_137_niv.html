      <h1>Psalm 137 NIV</h1>
      <div>In the New International Version of the 5th book of Psalms, the 137th chapter reads:s-p1By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept<br>when we remembered Zion.<br>s-p2There on the poplars<br>we hung our harps,<br>s-p3for there our captors asked us for songs,<br>our tormentors demanded songs of joy;<br>they said, “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”<br><br>s-p4How can we sing the songs of the Lord<br>while in a foreign land?<br>s-p5If I forget you, Jerusalem,<br>may my right hand forget its skill.<br>s-p6May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth<br>if I do not remember you,<br>if I do not consider Jerusalem<br>my highest joy.<br><br>s-p7Remember, Lord, what the Edomites did<br>on the day Jerusalem fell.<br>“Tear it down,” they cried,<br>“tear it down to its foundations!”<br>s-p8Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,<br>happy is the one who repays you<br>according to what you have done to us.<br>s-p9Happy is the one who seizes your infants<br>and dashes them against the rocks.This is following Psalm 136 NIV and before Psalm 138 NIV.</div>
