      <h1>Psalm 138 NIV</h1>
      <div>In the New International Version of the 5th book of Psalms, the 138th chapter reads:s-p1I will praise you Lord, with all my heart;<br>before the "gods" I will sing your praise.<br>s-p2I will bow down toward your holy temple<br>and will praise your name<br>for your unfailing love and your faithfulness,<br>for you have so exlated your solemn decree<br>that it surpasses your faith<br>s-p3When I called, you answered me;<br>you greatly emboldened me.<br><br>s-p4May all the kings of the earth praise you, Lord,<br>when they hear what you have decreed.<br>s-p5May they sing of the ways of the Lord,<br>for the glory of the Lord is great.<br><br>s-p6Though the Lord is exalted, he looks kindly on the lowly;<br>though lofty, he sees them from afar.<br>s-p7Though I walk in the mist of trouble,<br>you preserve my life.<br>You stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes;<br>with your right hand you save me.<br>s-p8The Lord will vindicate me;<br>your love, Lord, endures forever---<br>do not abandon the works of your hands.This is following Psalm 137 NIV and before Psalm 139 NIV.</div>
