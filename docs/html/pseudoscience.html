      <h1>Pseudoscience</h1>
      <div>Pseudoscience is a collection of concepts, beliefs, and claims that, despite appearing scientific, are not consistent with the scientific method. Pseudoscience often relies on misunderstandings and falsehoods to seem legitimate, even when contradicting established theories, observations, or reality itself. While pseudoscience is generally considered to be negative, the effects on society can vary from being a simple misconception to causing bodily harm and death.<br><br>Pseudoscience may be used for monetary or political incentives, reaffirming an worldview, or to position oneself as an authority figure in a field. Pseudoscience is closely related to conspiracy theories and science denial, utilizing anecdotes of how it applies with cherry-picked examples to support it while suppressing contradictory evidence. The amount of pushback on a pseudoscientific idea may be used to the spreader's advantage, weaponizing the idea of going against the "mainstream narrative" and "the establishment".<br><br>Pseudoscience comes in many forms and sizes, from local traditions that only affect small communities to affecting entire countries or the world. The field of pseudoscience can also vary, with examples including perpetual motion in physical science, autistic enterocolitis in medical science, and Holocaust denial in social science and history.</div>
