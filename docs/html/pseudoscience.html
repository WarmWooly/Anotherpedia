      <h1>Pseudoscience</h1>
      <div>Pseudoscience is a collection of concept, belief, and claim that, despite appearing scientific, are not consistent with the scientific method. Pseudoscience often relies on misunderstanding and falsehood to seem legitimacy, even when contradiction established scientific theory, observation, or reality itself. While pseudoscience is generally considered to be negative, the effects on society can vary from being a simple misconception to causing bodily harm and death.<br><br>Pseudoscience may be used for monetary incentive or political incentive, reaffirming an worldview, or to position oneself as an authority figure in a scientific field. Pseudoscience is closely related to conspiracy theory and science denial, utilizing anecote of how it applies with cherry picking examples to support it while suppressing contradictory evidence. The amount of pushback on a pseudoscientific idea may be used to the spreader's advantage, weaponizing the idea of going against the "mainstream narrative" and "the establishment".<br><br>Pseudoscience comes in many forms and sizes, from local tradition that only affect small community to affecting entire country or the humanity. The field of pseudoscience can also vary, with examples including perpetual motion in physical science, autistic enterocolitis in medical science, and Holocaust denial in social science and history.</div>
