      <h1>Purple Seal (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Purple Stake ({{aiBalatro).}}&spA Purple Seal is a Seal for playing cards in Balatro. When a Purple Seal is discarded, a random Tarot Card is created if there is room. This effect is also triggered when discarded from The Hook Boss Blind. Purple Seal can be obtained through the Spectral Card Medium or on cards randomly created in booster packs or the Shop.</div>
