I loved everything about it, starting with the nice bright white pages and larger than standard font, which makes reading it a breeze. Joyce Russell has a real gift for storytelling. She's funny, honest, ratable and from the heart. Her very short anecdotes of her life, from a child to present day, really hit home. I will look at life's situations differently and apply Joyce Russell's methods for going the extra mile to make any situation a win-win for everyone. This book is an excellent reminder that it is the little things that one can do to really make a huge difference in lives and situations, whether business or personal. Going the extra mile does pay off in many, many ways.&pLiz Patton&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - susan mclaughlin, United States on August 19, 2020&spWise, practical and inspiring!&spI love Joyce! Who wouldn't? I have had the great fortune to hear Joyce speak at C200 events over the years and have always taken away practical, impactful tips which I have incorporated into my leadership and personal processes and behavior. Joyce's book is a gift for all of us who strive to go the extra mile in all that we do.&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Cherrill Farnsworth, United States on March 22, 2020&spA business must read!&spWhat a personal, sensitive book that motivates and inspires. I highly recommend this read for those looking for basics on succeeding in any business.</div>
