Here are a few ratings:<br><br>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Lizzy, United States on March 27, 2020<br>Refreshing & inspiring<br>I just finished reading Put a Cherry on Top: Generosity in Life & Leadership & what a fun little read it was!  I loved everything about it, starting with the nice bright white pages and larger than standard font, which makes reading it a breeze.  Joyce Russell has a real gift for storytelling.  She's funny, honest, ratable and from the heart.  Her very short anecdotes of her life, from a child to present day, really hit home.  I will look at life's situations differently and apply Joyce Russell's methods for going the extra mile to make any situation a win-win for everyone.  This book is an excellent reminder that it is the little things that one can do to really make a huge difference in lives and situations, whether business or personal. Going the extra mile does pay off in many, many ways.<br><br>Liz Patton<br><br>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - susan mclaughlin, United States on August 19, 2020<br>Wise, practical and inspiring!<br>I love Joyce! Who wouldn't? I have had the great fortune to hear Joyce speak at C200 events over the years and have always taken away practical, impactful tips which I have incorporated into my leadership and personal processes and behavior. Joyce's book is a gift for all of us who strive to go the extra mile in all that we do.<br><br>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Cherrill Farnsworth, United States on March 22, 2020<br>A business must read!<br>What a personal, sensitive book that motivates and inspires. I highly recommend this read for those looking for basics on succeeding in any business.</div>
