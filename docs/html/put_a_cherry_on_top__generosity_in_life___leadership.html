I loved everything about it, starting with the nice bright white pages and larger than standard font, which makes reading it a breeze.  Joyce Russell has a real gift for storytelling.  She's funny, honest, ratable and from the heart.  Her very short anecdotes of her life, from a child to present day, really hit home.  I will look at life's situations differently and apply Joyce Russell's methods for going the extra mile to make any situation a win-win for everyone.  This book is an excellent reminder that it is the little things that one can do to really make a huge difference in lives and situations, whether business or personal. Going the extra mile does pay off in many, many ways.&pLiz Patton&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - susan mclaughlin, United States on August 19, 2020&sp{{bWise, practical and inspiring!}}&spI love Joyce! Who wouldn't? I have had the great fortune to hear Joyce speak at C200 events over the years and have always taken away practical, impactful tips which I have incorporated into my leadership and personal processes and behavior. Joyce's book is a gift for all of us who strive to go the extra mile in all that we do.&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Cherrill Farnsworth, United States on March 22, 2020&sp{{bA business must read!}}&spWhat a personal, sensitive book that motivates and inspires. I highly recommend this read for those looking for basics on succeeding in any business.</div>
