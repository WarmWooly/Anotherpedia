  <div><<shortMental shifting of realitiesshort>><<img(src=git/quantum jumping.png(cap=An [[image]] "related to" quantum jumping.img>>{{bQuantum jumping}}, also known as {{bparellel reality shifting}} or {{bmulti-dimensional awareness}}, is the changing the state of [[consciousness]] using the power of the [[mind]], where [[quantum mechanics]] is used a [[metaphor]] of quantum jumping. It utilizes the idea that [[quantum entanglement]] is only [[definitive]] on [[observation]], thusly all of [[reality]] is [[malleable]] via the [[human]] mind. If the mind does not consider reality "fixed" it becomes malleable, and to determine the [[outcome]] the jumper must [[believe]] that reality isn't fixed and/or real. The [[subconscious]] may block what the [[conscious]] is trying to pass through, so it is important to change [[self-perception]]. It takes a lot of [[time]] and [[practice]], where effects may be subtle, such as small "shifts" or the ability to see new things, but after full completion the jumper will be able to be in a new reality.&pQuantum jumping is [[pseudoscience]], relying on the "complexities of quantum mechanics and observation" in order to try and make it seem [[scientific]], despite not being such a thing. Quantum jumping is a [[person]] believing that they can change their reality with only their mind and [[spirit]]. This is [[impossible]] to do so because [[thoughts|thought]] are unable to alter reality, only what is [[perceived|perception]].</div>
