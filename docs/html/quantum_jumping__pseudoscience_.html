      <h1>Quantum jumping (pseudoscience)</h1>
      <div>Quantum jumping, also known as parellel reality shifting or multi-dimensional awareness, is the changing the state of consciousness using the power of the mind, where quantum mechanics is used a metaphor of quantum jumping. It utilizes the idea that quantum entanglement is only definitive on observation, thusly all of reality is malleable via the human mind. If the mind does not consider reality "fixed" it becomes malleable, and to determine the outcome the jumper must believe that reality isn't fixed and/or real. The subconscious may block what the conscious is trying to pass through, so it is important to change self-perception. It takes a lot of time and practice, where effects may be subtle, such as small "shifts" or the ability to see new things, but after full completion the jumper will be able to be in a new reality.<br><br>Quantum jumping is pseudoscience, relying on the "complexities of quantum mechanics and observation" in order to try and make it seem scientific, despite not being such a thing. Quantum jumping is a person believing that they can change their reality with only their mind and spirit. This is impossible to do so because thoughts are unable to alter reality, only what is perceived.</div>
