      <h1>Quivern</h1>
      <div>Quivern is a draconic Dragon element Pal from Palworld.

Quivern resembles a dragon, covered in a thick layer of white fur. It has a pair of large, rounded arms and legs with three digits each. It holds a tall stature, standing upright. Quivern has a large set of angelic-style feathery wings, adorned in a light blue. It has a long snout, a pair of blue eyes, and two antenna-like blue feathers on its head. It also has a long tail with a blue, feather-like tip.<br><br>Quivern's name was created by the Discord user @smackerooon, possibly being a portmanteau ending in wyvern.

Quivern is the 95th Pal in the Paldeck. The work suitability for Quivern is 1 for Handiwork, 3 for Transporting, 2 for Gathering, and 2 for Mining.</div>
