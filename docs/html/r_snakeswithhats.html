      <h1>r/SnakesWithHats</h1>
      <div>r/SnakesWithHats is a subreddit on Reddit in which users post snakes wearing snake-sized hats. The main use of r/SnakesWithHats is to share the creativity of snake owners in what they wish to equip their snakes, especially because it is cute.

The majority of posts made on r/SnakesWithHats consist of photos of snakes in hats. These hats may be made of felt, yarn (such as knitting or crocheting), clay, leather, or other similar hat materials. There have even been plastic hats and hats made of food. The hats come in a large array of shapes and sizes, such as cowboy hats, santa hats, and party hats. Others may be jokes regarding any object or loose material on top of the snake's head, playing it off as a "unique" or "new" hat.
