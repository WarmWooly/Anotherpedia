      <h1>Radian</h1>
      <div>A radian, denoted with θ, is a unit used as a measurement of an angle where 1 radian is equal to 1 unit on a unit circle, or where the radius is equal to the arc length. Radians are used in mathematics and often have the abbreviation rad. A radian is equal to 180/π degrees, or roughly 57.296 degrees.</div>
