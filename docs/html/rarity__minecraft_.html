  <h1>Rarity ({{iMinecraft}})</h1>
  <div><<shortItem color by difficulty in {{iMinecraft}}short>><<img(src=git/rarity minecraft.png(cap=Items with the four rarity tiers: a [[netherite ingot|netherite ingot (Minecraft)]], [[totem of undying|totem of undying (Minecraft)]], a beacon, and a dragon egg.img>>{{bRarity}} is a [[cosmetic]] [[color change]] for the name of a [[block|block (Minecraft)]] or [[item|item (Minecraft)]] within {{i[[Minecraft]]}} to signify the difficulty of obtaining the item. The four tiers of rarity are {{codeCommon}} (white), {{codeUncommon}} (yellow), {{codeRare}} (cyan), and {{codeEpic}} (magenta). Rarity is determined by the [[difficulty]] of obtaining the item, including the time to locate it, any challenges required to overcome, and how much of it exists within the world. Items [[crafted|crafting (minecraft)]] will inherit the highest rarity among the items in its recipe. Rarities may differ between [[Java|Minecraft: Java Edition]] and [[Bedrock|Minecraft: Bedrock Edition]] in a few cases. Most items are {{codeCommon}}, as they exist as various resources that can be (relatively) easily farmed and collected. {{codeUncommon}} items are harder to find, but are not as powerful or useful as the tier above, including [[echo shards|echo shard (Minecraft)]], most [[music discs|music disc (Minecraft)]], and [[chainmail armor|chainmail armor (Minecraft)]]. {{codeRare}} items are difficult to find and obtain, including the [[trident|trident (Minecraft)]], [[wither skeleton skull|wither skeleton skull (Minecraft)]], and [[beacon|beacon (Minecraft)]]. The last tier is {{codeEpic}}, containing the hardest blocks and items to  obtain in the game (and some [[Creative|Creative (Minecraft)]]-only items), including the [[elytra|elytra (Minecraft)]], [[dragon egg|dragon egg (Minecraft)]], and [[mace|mace (Minecraft)]].</div>
