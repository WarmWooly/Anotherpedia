      <h1>Rarity (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>Rarity is a cosmetic color change for the name of a block or item within Minecraft to signify the difficulty of obtaining the item. The four tiers of rarity are codeCommon (white), codeUncommon (yellow), codeRare (cyan), and codeEpic (magenta). Rarity is determined by the difficulty of obtaining the item, including the time to locate it, any challenges required to overcome, and how much of it exists within the world. Items crafted will inherit the highest rarity among the items in its recipe. Rarities may differ between Java and Bedrock in a few cases. Most items are codeCommon, as they exist as various resources that can be (relatively) easily farmed and collected. codeUncommon items are harder to find, but are not as powerful or useful as the tier above, including echo shards, most music discs, and chainmail armor. codeRare items are difficult to find and obtain, including the trident, wither skeleton skull, and beacon. The last tier is codeEpic, containing the hardest blocks and items to obtain in the game (and some Creative-only items), including the elytra, dragon egg, and mace.</div>
