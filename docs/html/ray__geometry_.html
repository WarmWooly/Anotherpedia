  <h1>Ray (geometry)</h1>
  <div>A ray is a part of a line (geometry) with a point (geometry) in a single direction up to infinity. It's length can't be measured because it has no end point. A ray is named based on the points it passes through, where a ray starting at A and passing through B would be ray AB.</div>
