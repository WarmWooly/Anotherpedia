The recycler can be crafted with 3 blocks of iron chains, 1 lava bucket, and 5 cobblestone (fill the bottom row with blocks of chains, put the lava in the center, fill the rest of the grid with cobblestone). Crafting a recycler will award the advancement Reduce, Reuse, and....



Recyclers are used in the following crafting recipes:&spChain Generator - 1 recycler, 5 cobblestone, 2 rose gold ingots, and 1 crude engine (place the recycler in the middle, then the ingots to the left and right and the engine on the bottom; fill the rest of the grid with cobblestone).

The recycler requires an industrial belt to run, with better belts increasing the speed the recycler can recycle. These are the recipes that the recycler can be used to perform:&sp9 Copper Chain Links --> Copper Nugget&sp9 Gold Chain Links --> Gold Nugget&sp9 Iron Chain Links --> Iron Nugget&sp9 Iron Composite Chain Links --> Iron Composite Nugget&sp80 Netherite Chain Links --> Netherite Scrap&sp9 Rose Gold Chain Links --> Rose Gold Nugget</div>
