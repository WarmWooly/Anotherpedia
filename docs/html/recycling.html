      <h1>Recycling</h1>
      <div>Recycling is the act of turning waste into a material that can be used. Many objects, such as paper, plastic, and metal, can be recycled into new materials. The majority of recyclable objects come from single-use goods, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and cardboard.&sp</div>
