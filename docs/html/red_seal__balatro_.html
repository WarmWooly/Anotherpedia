      <h1>Red Seal (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Red Stake ({{aiBalatro).}}&spA Red Seal is a Seal for playing cards in Balatro. When a Red Seal is scored or activated, the card is retriggered (adding chips to the score, triggering Enhancements and Editions, activating Jokers, etc). Red Seal can be obtained through the Spectral Card Deja Vu or on cards randomly created in booster packs or the Shop.</div>
