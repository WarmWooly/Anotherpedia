      <h1>Red velvet cake</h1>
      <div>Red velvet is a flavor of cake, usually red or crimson colored, and often frosted with white frosting. The red coloring is not from food coloring, but from the cocoa used in baking it. However, beet juice or red food coloring may be used for the color.</div>
