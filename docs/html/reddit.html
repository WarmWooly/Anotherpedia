      <h1>Reddit</h1>
      <div>Reddit is a social media platform where users, known as Redditors, make posts. Upvotes and downvotes are used to gauge interest in a post, which makes it more or less likely to be seen.&pReddit's topics for discussion are called subreddits, which are denoted with a 'r/'. These subreddits are also controlled by Redditors, which usually also have mods. Some of the largest subreddits are r/funny, r/aww, r/music, r/todayilearned, and r/worldnews.&pReddit's main demographic are young adults, but the minimum age is 13 years old, aka a teenager. There are even dedicated subreddits, such as r/teenagers, made for this younger audience. Some content prohibits viewing unless the user is over the age of 18.</div>
