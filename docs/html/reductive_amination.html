      <h1>Reductive amination</h1>
      <div>Reductive amination is a type of amination that causes a chemical reaction between a carbonyl group and an imine to make an amine. It is the most commonly used method used to make amines.
This organic reaction starts with the amine reacting with the carbonyl group, forming a hemiaminal. This hemiaminal then loses a single water molecule in a reversible reaction caused by alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, which creates the imine. By removing the water during the reaction, the process leans towards forming imines. After the reaction is complete, a reducing agent (such as sodium borohydride) can be used to isolate the imine.
This reaction is also known as the Borch reaction. This reaction has both the formation and reduction of imine in a single cycle. reagent such as sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride are often used due to the slow reaction and ability to tolerate the moderate acidic conditions. Acetic acid or other weak acid that are around a potential of hydrogen of 5 are used as a catalyst to have the carbonyl groups and the amine create iminium ions. These ions then create amines, with the process avoiding the carbonyl from forming alcohol (chemistry).</div>
