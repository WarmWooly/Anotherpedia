      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|10||hardness (Minecraft)|4||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|Yes||Waterlogging (Minecraft)|Yes||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The refined millstone is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Bread Reborn: Redefined used in milling (Bread Reborn: Redefined) items. It is the highest tier of millstones (Bread Reborn: Redefined).



A refined millstone can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 powered millstone (Bread Reborn: Redefined), 2 blaze rod (Minecraft), 1 diamond (Minecraft), and 2 obsidian (Minecraft) (place the millstone in the center, the diamond below, an rod above, the obsidian in the bottom corners, and a rod in the top-left corner). Upon crafting, the advancement (Minecraft) Milling Mastery (Bread Reborn: Redefined) will be awarded.



Main page: Milling ({{aiBread Reborn: Redefined)}}<br>To use the refined millstone, the item to be processed must be held in the main hand (Minecraft). Upon interacting with the refined millstone, the held item will be consumed, the output will be given to the player, and the millstone will rotate 45&deg. If the refined millstone is powered, up to 16 items will be processed at a time. Manually milling without power will slowly deplete hunger (Minecraft). When trying to process an item that can't be milled, the message "This item can't be milled!" will appear. The refined millstone can be mute when placed on wool (Minecraft). With an open hand, the refined millstone may be turned, going counter-clockwise while sneaking (Minecraft).

When powered, the refined millstone will rotate once, processing up to 16 Item (Minecraft entity) above it. If the block below it is open, the produced flours (Bread Reborn: Redefined) will fall through; otherwise, it will pop above the refined millstone. This can be used to automate the milling process by constantly rotating the millstone and allowing items to fall into a hopper (Minecraft).

A redstone comparator can read a refined millstone and output a signal based on how far rotated the refined millstone is from its resting position. The following are all the signal strengths from a comparator:<<tableState|Deg|Signal||0|r0&deg|r0||1|r45&deg|r3||2|r90&deg|r5||3|r135&deg|r7||4|r180&deg|r9||5|r225&deg|r11||6|r270&deg|r13||7|r315&deg|r15table>></div>
