  <h1>Replay ({{iYour Only Move Is HUSTLE}})</h1>
  <div><<shortPlayback of matches in {{iYOMIH}}short>><<img(src=git/yomih replay.gif(cap=A replay of the start of a match.img>>A {{breplay}} in {{i[[Your Only Move Is HUSTLE]]}} is a playback of a [[match|match (YOMIH)]], excluding the gameplay between actions, which is automatically created after a match ends. Replays can be manually saved at any point in a match in the pause menu, but only multiplayer matches will autosave. Replays can be viewed under the "Replays" button in the main menu, bringing up a list of saved replays. By toggling "show autosaved replays", autosaves will also be listed alongside manually saved replays.&pOn selecting a replay, the match will be replayed in full. If the replay was ended prematurely, such as saving mid-match or having a player leave, then the controls to continue the match will appear. Otherwise, the replay will continue looping. Replays can be edited to change the moves done in the match, effectively allowing for an in-depth analysis and allowing players to determine what moves would have been better in that situation. Edited replays can also be manually saved. The version the match was played will also be shown. Playing replays from different versions may cause the game to crash.<<hrTechnical detailshr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbc1jhLxGAw(cap=A replay in {{iYOMIH}}.yt>>When saving a replay without a name, it will default to the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second (in the form of year-month-day-hour-minute-second; i.e. {{code2024-12-7-11-23-8}}). Autosaved replays will be named with P1's name v P2's name in addition to the date (in the form of name1_v_name2-year-month-day-hour-minute-second; i.e. {{codeguyMan_v_xXrizzardXx-2024-12-7-11-23-8}}). Replays are stored in a {{codeYourOnlyMoveIsHUSTLE}} folder {{codereplay}}, containing a {{codesteam_autocloud.vdf}}, all manually saved {{code.replay}} files, and a folder {{codeautosave}} containing autosave {{code.replay}} files.<<hrUseful modshr>>[[Mods|modding (YOMIH)]] for {{iYOMIH}} can be used to enhance replays. The most notable are {{i[[Your Only Move Is Record]]}} and {{i[[Replay+|Replay+ (YOMIH)]]}}. {{iYour Only Move Is Record}} gives the ability to take [[screenshots|screenshot]] of replays and to use [[FFmpeg]] to record and save replays as [[MP4s|MP4 file format]]. {{iReplay+}} gives multiple manipulation tools for replays, including a timeline, a pause and advance system, and camera controls.</div>
