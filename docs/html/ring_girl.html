      <h1>Ring girl</h1>
      <div>A ring girl is a woman who holds a sign signifying the current round of a combat sport, mainly boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts. 
Ring girls often come from a modeling background. There have been a few cases for a "ring boy" to appear, but that is often uncommon.</div>
