      <h1>RIVALS (Roblox game)</h1>
      <div>{{iRIVALS}} is a 2024 Roblox FPS developed by Nosniy Games. Players are placed into a map with a primary, secondary, melee, and utility weapons to kill opposing players. There are a variety of modes that can be played, with the most popular being the 1v1 to 5v5 modes, where players are placed onto two teams and have to defeat all opponents within a time limit without dying themselves.
The core gameplay has the player run around a map to kill an opponent with a variety of selectable weapons with different attributes, stats, and special effects. RIVALS allows players to switch weapons between rounds to both increase variety during battles and to adjust the layout in response to the opponent.
The main mode of RIVALS is Duels, where 1 to 5 players are placed onto each team (named Nosniy Inc. and Sensei & Co.). A match is comprised of a first-to-5 system, where the team that wins 5 rounds will be the victor of the match. A round is won by defeating all opponents or having the higher health after the time limit expires. Players can select a map and their loadout, with the ability to change their loadout after every round. There is also a ranked mode where players can climb a leaderboard and gain ranks by defeating similarly-skilled opponents.</div>
