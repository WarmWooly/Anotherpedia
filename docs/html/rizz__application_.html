      <h1>RIZZ (application)</h1>
      <div>RIZZ is an artifical intelligence (AI) app developed for the App Store by Trend It LLC. The user is able to input screenshots of a conversation, notably on dating apps such as Tinder, to have the AI generate a response, known as a "rizzponse", which can then be used by the user to respond to the conversation. The goal is to help aid in conversations, with the AI adapting to the user's speech patterns.
For iPhones and iPods, it requires iOS 15.0 or later to run. For Macs, it needs macOS 12 or later, alongside an Apple M1 chip or later. The app is free to download, and can only be downloaded on the App Store, but on downloading, it requires an in-app purchase to use. It is considered a "lifestyle" app.&pThe age rating is 17+ due to the type of content that can be generated, mainly relating to mature topics associated to rizzing up someone.&pThere are multiple in-app purchases that can be made, such as "Starter RIZZ", "Unlimited RIZZ", "INFINITE RIZZ", and "INFINITE RIZZ — ONE YEAR" from $0.99 up to $69.99.
<<AsofJuly 2024>>, RIZZ has a rating of 4.6/5 stars, which is most likely caused not by the quality of the app, but rather made up of jokes about the idea of an AI dating app called "RIZZ", framing it as very effective at attracting women. Here are a few ratings and responses:&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - JAI_vi, 03/01/2023&spI declined my offer to go to Yale&spSo recently I have been applying to college and Yale was one of the universities.
