      <h1>RIZZ (application)</h1>
      <div><<shortAI-based dating response applicationshort>><<img(src=git/rizz ai.png(cap=The [[logo]] for RIZZ.img>>{{bRIZZ}} is an [[artifical intelligence]] ([[AI|abbreviation]]) [[app|application]] developed for the [[App Store|Apple Store]] by [[Trend It LLC]]. The [[user]] is able to input [[screenshots|screenshot]] of a [[conversation]], notably on [[dating apps|dating application]] such as [[Tinder]], to have the AI generate a response, known as a "rizzponse", which can then be used by the user to respond to the conversation. The [[goal]] is to help aid in conversations, with the AI adapting to the user's speech patterns.<<hrApp informationhr>>For [[iPhones|iPhone]] and [[iPods|iPod]], it requires [[iOS]] [[15.0|iOS 15]] or later to run. For [[Macs|Mac]], it needs [[macOS]] [[12|macOS 12]] or later, alongside an [[Apple M1 chip]] or later. The app is [[free]] to [[download]], and can only be downloaded on the App Store, but on downloading, it requires an in-app [[purchase]] to use. It is considered a "lifestyle" app.&pThe [[age rating|age rating (apple store)]] is 17+ due to the type of content that can be generated, mainly relating to [[mature]] topics associated to [[rizzing|rizz]] up someone.&pThere are multiple in-app purchases that can be made, such as "Starter RIZZ", "Unlimited RIZZ", "INFINITE RIZZ", and "INFINITE RIZZ — ONE YEAR" from $0.99 up to $69.99.<<hrReviewshr>><<AsofJuly 2024>>, RIZZ has a rating of 4.6/5 [[stars|star (rating)]], which is most likely caused not by the quality of the app, but rather made up of [[jokes|joke]] about the idea of an AI dating app called "RIZZ", framing it as very effective at attracting women. Here are a few ratings and responses:&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - JAI_vi, 03/01/2023&sp{{bI declined my offer to go to Yale}}&spSo recently I have been applying to college and Yale was one of the universities. School had me stressed so far so I downloaded tinder. I had no luck talking with the ladies. I ended up getting accepted to Yale but a couple days later I downloaded the app. Gave me great results! I now study Rizzology and RIZZARD University. Getting such good results I might finish as Rizzard Cummerbund laude🤌🏻&p{{bDeveloper Response:}}&spYo, congrats on getting accepted to rizzard!
