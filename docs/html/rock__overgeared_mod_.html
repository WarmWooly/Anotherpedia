  <h1>Rock (Overgeared mod)</h1>
  <div><<info||{{bStats}}||{{bRarity (Minecraft)}}|Common||{{bStack size (Minecraft)}}|64||{{bFire-resistant item (Minecraft)}}|Noinfo>>The {{brock}} is an item (Minecraft) in the {{iMinecraft}} mod (Minecraft) {{iOvergeared (Minecraft mod)}} used in crafting the stone tool heads used to make stone tools (Minecraft).
To obtain rocks, the player must use flint (Minecraft) on stone (Minecraft) repeatedly. Every time the stone is knapped, the flint will have a chance to break. After a random amount of knapping, the stone will turn into cobblestone (Minecraft) and a rock will fall out.
When using a rock in the main hand (Minecraft) and the offhand (Minecraft), the player can knap a rock into a stone tool head. Depending on the shape the player makes, a corresponding tool head will be formed. A rock from the main hand will be consumed by knapping. If the player cancels out while knapping, the rock will still be lost. While knapping, a menu will appear, allowing the player to click on parts of the rock to remove, with five different shapes corresponding to each tool head that will register. The following are the items that can be knapped:&spStone Axe Head (Overgeared mod) - Make a 2x2 square and remove one of the bottom corners.&spStone Hoe Head[[Stone Axe Head|Stone Axe Head (Overgeared mod) - Make a 2x1 horizontal line.&spStone Pickaxe Head[[Stone Axe Head|Stone Axe Head (Overgeared mod) - Make a 3x1 horizontal line.&spStone Shovel Head[[Stone Axe Head|Stone Axe Head (Overgeared mod) - Make a 1x1 square.&spStone Sword Blade[[Stone Axe Head|Stone Axe Head (Overgeared mod) - Make a 1x2 vertical line.</div>
