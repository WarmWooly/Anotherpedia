The rockets cause a large explosion, killing those within their radius while disorienting those nearby. The rockets can slide right before blowing up, potentially overshooting the target. When holding the Rocket Launcher, a random meme will flash on the screen, effectively blinding the user for a short period. If the image flashed on screen is of Jeff from the Roblox game Doors, the badge Please give me money. Not him, me! will be awarded.

The following messages appear when a player is killed with the Rocket Launcher:;;X was turned to ash by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was shot by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was killed by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was tagged by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was zapped by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was destroyed by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was blown up by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was rekt by Y using Rocket Launcher|X was oofed by Y using Rocket Launcher;;</div>
