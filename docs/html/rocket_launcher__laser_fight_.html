The rockets cause a large explosion, killing those within their radius while disorienting those nearby. The rockets can slide right before blowing up, potentially overshooting the target. When holding the Rocket Launcher, a random meme will flash on the screen, effectively blinding the user for a short period. If the image flashed on screen is of Jeff (Doors) from the Roblox video game Doors (Roblox game), the badge (Roblox) Please give me money. Not him, me! (Laser Fight) will be awarded.
