The rockets cause a large explosion, killing those within their radius while disorienting those nearby. The rockets can slide right before blowing up, potentially overshooting the target. When holding the Rocket Launcher, a random meme will flash on the screen, effectively blinding the user for a short period. If the image flashed on screen is of Jeff from the Roblox game Doors, the badge Please give me money. Not him, me! will be awarded.
