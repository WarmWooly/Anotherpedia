      <h1>Rohuzz</h1>
      <div>Rohuzz, or ruzz, is a portmanteau of Roblox and huzz, describing individuals falling under the umbrella slang term "huzz" within Roblox. The term is seen on TikTok to refer to players (often teenagers) who try to pull rohuzz with their rizz in-game, despite the fact that Roblox is not a dating site.</div>
