  <h1>Role (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
  <div><<shortClass system in {{iSCP: Devolved Revamp}}short>><<img(src=git/role scpdr.png(cap=Players from all 8 roles.img>>{{bRoles}} are one of the biggest key features in {{i[[SCP: Devolved Revamp]]}} as they are the main factor that differentiates players from each other. Depending on what role you choose to play as will determine what tasks you have to do and who your allies and enemies are. There are currently 8 different roles to choose from, those being: Class D (CD), Research Department (RD), Maintenance Staff (MS), Paramedic Team (PT), Site Security (SS), Chaos Insurgency (CI), Mobile Task Force (MTF), and Administrative Branch (AD). Every role has 5 levels to it, as stated in the SCP: Devolved Revamp page, and they all require the same amount of XP over a linear path to max out (900 XP). The level of [[keycard|keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]] (KC) given covers the ones prior, ordered [[Class D|Class D Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[Level 1|Level 1 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[Level 2|Level 2 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[Level 3|Level 3 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], and [[Level 4|Level 4 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]. For each role, there are special rewards for making it to each level, like new name titles and, for combative roles, new weapons as listed below:<<table{{bRole}}|{{bLevel 1}}|{{bLevel 2}}|{{bLevel 3}}|{{bLevel 4}}| {{bLevel 5}}||{{bXP Req.|0 XP&sp0 hours|60 XP&sp1 hour|300 XP&sp5 hours|660 XP&sp11 hours|900 XP&sp15 hours||{{bClass D}}|"Newbie"&spClass D KC|"Disposable Inmate"|"Expeirenced Inmate"|"Respected Inmate"|"Veteran Inmate"||{{bResearch Department}}|"Intern"&spLevel 2 KC, Authorize Tool|"Assistant Researcher"|"Scientific Researcher"&spLevel 3 KC|"Senior Researcher"|"Board Authority"&spLevel 4 KC||{{bParamedic Team}}|"Trainee"&spLevel 1 KC, Heals 10 HP|"Field Medic"&spHeals 15 HP|"Advanced Care"&spLevel 2 KC, Heals 20 HP|"Critical Healer"&spHeals 25 HP|"Program Leader"&spLevel 3 KC, Heals 30 HP||{{bMaintenance Staff}}|"Apprentice"&spLevel 1 KC|"Custodian"|"Technician"&spLevel 2 KC|"Supervisor"|"Chief Engineer"&spLevel 3 KC||{{bSite Security}}|"Cadet"&spLevel 2 KC, [[EF Model 5|EF Model 5 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Guard"&sp[[M9 Baretta|M9 Baretta (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Sergeant"&spLevel 3 KC, [[FN P90|FN P90 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Lieutenant"&sp[[HK MP5KSD|HK MP5KSD (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Captain"&spLevel 4 KC, [[Kriss Vector|Kriss Vector (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]||{{bChaos Insurgency}}|"Recruit"&spLevel 2 KC, [[AK-74|AK-74 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Delta Operative"&sp[[PM Makarov|PM Makarov (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Elite Operative"&sp[[FN FAL|FN FAL (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Gamma Personnel"&spLevel 3 KC, [[Vz.61 Skorpion|Vz.62 Skorpion (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Beta Command"&sp[[PKM|PKM (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]||{{bMobile Task Force}}|"Junior Operative"&spLevel 3 KC, [[Colt M4A1|Colt M4A1 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Combat Operative"&sp[[SIG P226|SIG P226 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Senior Operative"&sp[[SCAR-H|SCAR-H (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Task Force Officer"&spLevel 4 KC, [[IMI Mini UZI|IMI Mini UZI (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Commander"&sp[[M249 SAW|M249 SAW (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]||{{bAdministrative Branch}}|"Staff Manager"&spLevel 3 KC, [[Handcuffs|Handcuffs (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]], [[Desert Eagle XIX|Desert Eagle XIX (SCP: Devolved Revamp)]]|"Committee Member"|"Site Coordinator"&spLevel 4 KC|"Board Director"|"Executive Council"table>></div>
