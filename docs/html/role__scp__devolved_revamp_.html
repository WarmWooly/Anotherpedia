      <h1>Role (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>Roles are one of the biggest key features in SCP: Devolved Revamp as they are the main factor that differentiates players from each other. Depending on what role you choose to play as will determine what tasks you have to do and who your allies and enemies are. There are currently 8 different roles to choose from, those being: Class D (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (CD), Research Department (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (RD), Maintenance Staff (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (MS), Paramedic Team (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (PT), Site Security (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (SS), Chaos Insurgency (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (CI), Mobile Task Force (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (MTF), and Administrative Branch (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (AD). Every role has 5 levels to it, as stated in the SCP: Devolved Revamp page, and they all require the same amount of XP over a linear path to max out (900 XP). The level of keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp) (KC) given covers the ones prior, ordered Class D Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp), Level 1 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp), Level 2 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp), Level 3 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp), and Level 4 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp).
