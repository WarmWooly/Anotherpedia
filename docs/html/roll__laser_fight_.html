  <h1>Roll ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortGround-based movement action in {{iLaser Fightshort>><<img(src=git/roll laser fight.png(cap=A player rolling.img>>A {{broll}} is a [[movement action|movement (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} triggered by pressing {{codeF}} while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while grounded after performing a [[fall break|fall break (Laser Fight)]]. Rolling gives a larger speed boost in a single direction compared to a slide, but it ends much earlier. A roll can be interrupted by [[jumping|jump (Laser Fight)]] or by allowing the roll to naturally decay. Holding [[sprint|sprint (Laser Fight)]] ({{codeShift}}) will increase the duration of the roll. Rolling will slow down over time, ending when the roll is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A roll awards 1 [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]]. A roll costs 10 [[stamina|stamina (Laser Fight)]] to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an [[Ice Ray|Ice Ray (Laser Fight)]] increases the roll speed multiplier from 8 to 9 and decreases the roll momentum decay from 60% to 50%. When sliding out of a [[belly flop|belly flop (Laser Fight)]] ([[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]] --> fall break), a [[belly roll|belly roll (Laser Fight)]] will be performed, awarding 2 exp.</div>
