      <h1>Roll (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A roll is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by pressing codeF while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while grounded after performing a fall break. Rolling gives a larger speed boost in a single direction compared to a slide, but it ends much earlier. A roll can be interrupted by jumping or by allowing the roll to naturally decay. Holding sprint (codeShift) will increase the duration of the roll. Rolling will slow down over time, ending when the roll is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A roll awards 1 exp. A roll costs 10 stamina to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an Ice Ray increases the roll speed multiplier from 8 to 9 and decreases the roll momentum decay from 60% to 50%. When sliding out of a belly flop (dive --> fall break), a belly roll will be performed, awarding 2 exp.</div>
