  <h1>Rose Gold Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|64||Enchantability (Minecraft)|8||Attack damage (Minecraft)|2||Attack speed (Minecraft)|1||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Rose gold pliers are an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used for snipping chain link (Not Lazy Chainmail) from coil (Not Lazy Chainmail) and unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail).
Rose gold pliers can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail), 1 block of rose gold chains (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 2 stick (Minecraft) (place the block in the middle, then the rose gold above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left).
The chances to find iron pliers in chest (Minecraft) are the following:&spIn a chainmailler home (Not Lazy Chainmail), a chest has a 51% chance to contain rose gold pliers (19% chance for it to be enchantment (Minecraft)).<<note(content=The chainmailler home has a double chest, both rolling loot table (Minecraft) with 1 roll that contains a 3 in 10 chance to select rose gold pliers (1 in 10 for enchanted). The chance for at least 1 pair of rose gold pliers to be inside the double chest is calculated as code1 - (7/10){{s-u2 = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51}} (code1 - (9/10){{s-u2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19}} for enchanted).(text=noteCountnote>>
Hold the rose gold pliers in the offhand (Minecraft) with the coil or unfinished project to be snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail) in the main hand (Minecraft). To remove a chain from the coil/unfinished project, right-click anywhere. This will use the pliers and create two chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type. When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.
The Auto Snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting the rose gold pliers, an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail), and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The rose gold pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.
Rose gold pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Rose gold pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 tick (Minecraft)).
Rose gold pliers can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining rose gold pliers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the rose gold pliers, costing experience.
Rose gold pliers can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).
The runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast on rose gold pliers to give Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail) (unbreakable), costing 2 experience (Minecraft).</div>
