The chance for at least 1 pair of rose gold pliers to be inside the double chest is calculated as {{code1 - (7/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51}} ({{code1 - (9/10){{s-u2}} = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19}} for enchanted).(text=noteCountnote>><<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Snippinghr2>>Hold the rose gold pliers in the [[offhand|offhand (Minecraft)]] with the coil or unfinished project to be [[snipped|snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] in the [[main hand|main hand (Minecraft)]]. To remove a chain from the coil/unfinished project, right-click anywhere. This will use the pliers and create two chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type. When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.<<hr3Auto snipperhr3>>The [[Auto Snipper|Auto Snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] is a [[block|block (Minecraft)]] that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting the rose gold pliers, an [[industrial belt|industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The rose gold pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.<<hr2Weaponhr2>>Rose gold pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Rose gold pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 [[ticks|tick (Minecraft)]]).<<hr2Repairinghr2>>Rose gold pliers can be repaired through [[combining|combining (Minecraft)]] by [[crafting|crafting (Minecraft)]], using a [[grindstone|grindstone (Minecraft)]], or using an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]]. Combining rose gold pliers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some [[experience|experience (Minecraft)]] returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the rose gold pliers, costing experience.<<hr2Enchantinghr2>>Rose gold pliers can be [[enchanted|enchanting (Minecraft)]] with [[Unbreaking|Unbreaking (Minecraft)]], [[Mending|Mending (Minecraft)]], and [[Curse of Vanishing|Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft)]], using an [[enchanted book|enchanted book (Minecraft)]] on an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]]. Unbreaking may also be obtained in an [[enchanting table|enchanting table (Minecraft)]].<<hr2Rune castinghr2>>The [[rune|runes (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] [[Automated Permanence Rune|Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be cast on rose gold pliers to give [[Automated Permanence|Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (unbreakable), costing 2 [[levels|experience (Minecraft)]].</div>
