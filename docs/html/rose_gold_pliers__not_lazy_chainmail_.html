      <h1>Rose Gold Pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|64||Enchantability|8||Attack damage|2||Attack speed|1||Fire/lava &spesistance|Noinfo>>Rose gold pliers are an item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used for snipping chain links from coils and unfinished projects.



Rose gold pliers can be crafted with 2 rose gold ingots, 1 block of rose gold chains, and 2 sticks (place the block in the middle, then the rose gold above and to the right, and the sticks to the bottom and the left).

The chances to find iron pliers in chests are the following:&spIn a chainmailler home, a chest has a 51% chance to contain rose gold pliers (19% chance for it to be enchanted).<<note(content=The chainmailler home has a double chest, both rolling loot tables with 1 roll that contains a 3 in 10 chance to select rose gold pliers (1 in 10 for enchanted). The chance for at least 1 pair of rose gold pliers to be inside the double chest is calculated as code1 - (7/10)s-u2 = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51 (code1 - (9/10)s-u2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19 for enchanted).(text=noteCountnote>>



Hold the rose gold pliers in the offhand with the coil or unfinished project to be snipped in the main hand. To remove a chain from the coil/unfinished project, right-click anywhere. This will use the pliers and create two chain links of the coil's/unfinished project's material type. When a coil/unfinished project goes down to 0 remaining chains, it will be removed.

The Auto Snipper is a block that can be used to automatically snip coils/unfinished projects. By inputting the rose gold pliers, an industrial belt, and coils/unfinished projects, the coils/unfinished projects will be automatically snipped. The rose gold pliers will still lose durability while automatically snipping.

Rose gold pliers are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. Rose gold pliers deal 2 damage and have an attack cooldown of 1 (1 second or 20 ticks).

Rose gold pliers can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining rose gold pliers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the rose gold pliers, costing experience.

Rose gold pliers can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, and Curse of Vanishing, using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

The rune Automated Permanence Rune can be cast on rose gold pliers to give Automated Permanence (unbreakable), costing 2 levels.</div>
