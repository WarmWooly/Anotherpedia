      <h1>Rotary</h1>
      <div><<shortRound road intersectionshort>><<img(src=git/rotary.jpg(cap=A [[stock photo]] of a rotary.img>>A {{brotary}} is a round [[intersection|intersection (road)]] with an [[island|Island (road)]] in the center. There is no requirement to slow down when entering a rotary. Most rotaries have four entrances and exits.&pIn the [[USA|United States]], drivers enter and go [[counterclockwise]] around the rotary. If there is one lane entering, a driver can stay right or [[merge|Merge (driving)]] into the rotary. If there are two lanes entering, the right lane usually sticks to going right while the left lane must merge.&pRotaries are much less safe compared to [[roundabouts|Roundabout]] due to the higher speeds and the requirement to merge to get off the majority of exits. They are made to increase the flow of traffic and eliminate full stops on the road.</div>
