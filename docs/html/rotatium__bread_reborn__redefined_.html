  <h1>Rotatium (Bread Reborn: Redefined)</h1>
  <div><<info||{{bStats}}||{{bRarity (Minecraft)}}|Common||{{bStack size (Minecraft)}}|64||{{bFire-resistant item (Minecraft)}}|Noinfo>>{{bRotatium}} is a placeholder item (Minecraft) in the {{iMinecraft}} mod (Minecraft) {{iBread Reborn: Redefined}} that is stored within millstones (Bread Reborn: Redefined) when rotated.
A millstone can contain 0--7 rotatium, which it uses to allow redstone comparator (Minecraft) to output a redstone signal (Minecraft) based on the direction of the millstone. Rotatium increases while going clockwise and decreases while going counter-clockwise, with it resetting when the millstone is rotated back to its starting position. Rotatium can't be collected from a millstone, even when the millstone breaks.</div>
