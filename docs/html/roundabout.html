      <h1>Roundabout</h1>
      <div>A roundabout is a round intersection (road) with an Island (road) in the center. Every car entering a roundabout must Yield (driving) to traffic inside the roundabout. Most roundabouts have four entrances and exits.<br><br>In the United States, drivers enter and go counterclockwise around the roundabout. Some roundabouts have two lanes, where the left lane is used for left and U-Turn, while the right lane is used for right turns and going straight.<br><br>Roundabouts remove the possibility of a t-bone and decrease the severity of any Car Crash that happen inside. They are also made to increase the flow of traffic and helps reduce full stops on the road.<br><br>Rotary and Traffic Circle are both used as Synonym to a roundabout, but they are also their own unique intersection type.</div>
