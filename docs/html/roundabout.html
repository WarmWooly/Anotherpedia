      <h1>Roundabout</h1>
      <div>A roundabout is a round intersection with an island in the center. Every car entering a roundabout must yield to traffic inside the roundabout. Most roundabouts have four entrances and exits.&pIn the USA, drivers enter and go counterclockwise around the roundabout. Some roundabouts have two lanes, where the left lane is used for left and u-turns, while the right lane is used for right turns and going straight.&pRoundabouts remove the possibility of a t-bone and decrease the severity of any accidents that happen inside. They are also made to increase the flow of traffic and helps reduce full stops on the road.&pRotaries and traffic circles are both used as synonyms to a roundabout, but they are also their own unique intersection type.</div>
