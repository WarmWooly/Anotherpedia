      <h1>Roundabout (Mini Motorways)</h1>
      <div>This page is focused on the version of {{aiMini Motorways on Steam (service).}}<br>A roundabout is a 3x3 intersection used to increase speed where car (Mini Motorways) can cross between roads. The main benefit of a roundabout is increased traffic flow (Mini Motorways) afforded by the speeds at which cars can navigate a roundabout. The downside is the space it requires, especially when house (Mini Motorways) and business (Mini Motorways) are packed closely together at an intersection. Roundabouts can also get clogged when demand increases, choking the city. Roundabouts are best played early when there is a plethora of space available. Roundabouts can accept up to 8 roads per intersection. Roundabouts, compared to traffic light (Mini Motorway), are better at managing high-demand intersections with multiple colors.

The weekly upgrade (Mini Motorways) for roundabouts awards 1 roundabout and 20 road (Mini Motorways).<br><br>The following are all modifiers (Mini Motorway) related to roundabouts:<br>Swings and Roundabouts - No Roundabouts are Offered.<br>Round Two - Double the number of roundabouts awarded.<br>Merry-Go-Roundabout - Unlimited Roundabouts.

The following are Mini Motorways achievements related to roundabouts:<br>The Roundabout Way - Use 25 roundabouts over multiple games.<br>Going in Circles - Use 50 roundabouts over multiple games.<br>Roundabout City - Use 100 roundabouts over multiple games.</div>
