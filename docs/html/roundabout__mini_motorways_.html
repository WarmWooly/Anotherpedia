      <h1>Roundabout (Mini Motorways)</h1>
      <div>This page is focused on the version of aiMini Motorways on Steam.&spA roundabout is a 3x3 intersection used to increase speed where cars can cross between roads. The main benefit of a roundabout is increased traffic flow afforded by the speeds at which cars can navigate a roundabout. The downside is the space it requires, especially when houses and businesses are packed closely together at an intersection. Roundabouts can also get clogged when demand increases, choking the city. Roundabouts are best played early when there is a plethora of space available. Roundabouts can accept up to 8 roads per intersection. Roundabouts, compared to traffic lights, are better at managing high-demand intersections with multiple colors.

The weekly upgrade for roundabouts awards 1 roundabout and 20 roads.&pThe following are all modifiers related to roundabouts:&spSwings and Roundabouts - No Roundabouts are Offered.&spRound Two - Double the number of roundabouts awarded.&spMerry-Go-Roundabout - Unlimited Roundabouts.

The following are achievements related to roundabouts:&spThe Roundabout Way - Use 25 roundabouts over multiple games.&spGoing in Circles - Use 50 roundabouts over multiple games.&spRoundabout City - Use 100 roundabouts over multiple games.</div>
