  <h1>Rule 250 (Hybrid)</h1>
  <div>{{bRule # 250}} is a rule in the collection/"role-playing game" {{iHybrid (RPG)}} that describes how a player could become brilliance and a millionaire within the system. The rule requires the player to have an unspecified quantity of life force points, with gender bias favoring women over men within college accounted for. The rule is geared towards a college student taking a academic major in a college degree towards a scientific field with a academic minor or dual degree in business degree. The "maximum college course #" is calculated with {{code100*(C2 PL){{s-u1/2}}}} or {{code20*(C2 PL)}}, with the salary (calculated weekly) with {{code10{{s-u(C2 PL){{s-u1/2}}}}}} or {{code10((2*(C2 PL))/10) = 10{{s-u(C2 PL)/5}}}} in $United States Dollar. If the projects the player partakes in have more complexity, then the salary is calculated as monthly (with the player making ~1/4 the salary in theory). The author also noted that this rule could be used to calculate the Intelligence quotient of Albert Einstein, despite none of the equations being related to IQ.</div>
