      <h1>Rule 250 (Hybrid)</h1>
      <div>Rule # 250 is a rule in the collection/"RPG" Hybrid that describes how a player could become brilliant and a millionaire within the system. The rule requires the player to have an unspecified quantity of life force points, with bias favoring women over men within college accounted for. The rule is geared towards a college student taking a major in a degree towards a science with a minor or second major in Business. The "maximum college course #" is calculated with code100*(C2 PL){{s-u1/2}} or code20*(C2 PL), with the salary (calculated weekly) with code10{{s-u(C2 PL){{s-u1/2}}}} or code10((2*(C2 PL))/10) = 10{{s-u(C2 PL)/5}} in $USD. If the projects the player partakes in have more complexity, then the salary is calculated as monthly (with the player making ~1/4 the salary in theory). The author also noted that this rule could be used to calculate the IQ of Albert Einstein, despite none of the equations being related to IQ.</div>
