  <h1>Rule 271 (Hybrid)</h1>
  <div>Rule # 271 is a rule in the collection/"role-playing game" Hybrid (RPG) that describes when the unit foot (unit) and meter are used for animal. Meters can only be used for jellyfish, while all other animals use feet. It also gives examples on how the units are used, such as to find the height of Godzilla (1981 appearance at 232.23 ft). Normal animals that are depicted as monster (i.e. the great white shark) will have their length reduced by a factor of 2--24 ft.</div>
