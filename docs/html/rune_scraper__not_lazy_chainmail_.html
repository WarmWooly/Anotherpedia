      <h1>Rune Scraper (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|64||Enchantability (Minecraft)|2||Harvest level (Minecraft)|1||Efficiency|2||Attack damage (Minecraft)|1.5||Attack speed (Minecraft)|2||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The chainsword is an item (Minecraft) (technically a sword (Minecraft)) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail, which can be used to remove runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) enchantment (Minecraft).



The rune scraper can be crafting (Minecraft) with 1 bedrock shard (Not Lazy Chainmail) and 1 rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail) (place the ingot in the middle, then the shard to the bottom-left).



When held in the offhand (Minecraft), the rune scraper can be used to remove runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) enchantment (Minecraft) from a held item, giving back experience (Minecraft) based on the enchantments. The returned experience is half the levels originally needed to cast the runes, added together and rounded down. The following are the returned levels per rune enchantment:<<tableEnchantment|Levels||Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.0||Quick Erosion (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.5||Separation (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2.5||Locating (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.0||Tracking (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.0||Laceration (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2.5||Experienced (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r5.0||Acceleration (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.5||Dexterous (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.0||Featherweight (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2.5||Ascension (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r6.0||Hunger Endurance (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.0||Nimble (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2.0||Shatter (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2.0||Shuffle (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3.0||Chain Repair (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1.5||Dampened (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r0.5||Muffled (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r0.5table>><br>If a rune enchantment is scraped off a rune scraper, the advancement (Minecraft) Scraper Paradox (Not Lazy Chainmail) will be awarded.

Rune scrapers can be used to mine bamboo (Minecraft), bamboo sapling (Minecraft), cobweb (Minecraft), and other blocks faster than other tools, costing 2 durability per block broken. In Creative (Minecraft), the rune scraper will not break blocks, but will destroy placed entity (Minecraft).

While not specifically designed for combat, the rune scraper can technically be used, with each attack costing 1 durability. The rune scraper deals 1.5 damage and has an attack cooldown of 2 (0.5 seconds or 10 tick (Minecraft)). The rune scraper can be used to perform Sweep attack (Minecraft) like other swords.

The rune scraper can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining rune scrapers will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the rune scrapers, costing experience. Rune scrapers can be repaired in an anvil using a rose gold ingot (Not Lazy Chainmail) or bedrock shard (Not Lazy Chainmail), restoring 25% of the rune scraper's durability, rounded down.

Rune scrapers can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), Sharpness (Minecraft), Smite (Minecraft), Bane of Arthropods (Minecraft), Knockback (Minecraft), Fire Aspect (Minecraft), Looting (Minecraft), and Sweeping Edge (Minecraft) using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking, Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, and Sweeping Edge may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).

Multiple runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast onto rune scrapers:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Dampen Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Dampened (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|I||Muffle Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Muffled (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1 level|Itable>></div>
