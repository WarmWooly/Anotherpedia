Rupters are likely the first hostile parasite a player will encounter, evolving from Buglins or naturally spawning in early Evolution Phases.

Rupters will evolve from Buglins that have been alive for 75 seconds, which naturally spawn in Phases 0 to 2. Rupters will naturally spawn in any dimension in Phases 1 to 5. Scents level 0 and 1 will always spawn rupters, while levels 2 and 3 have rupters as a member of the scent's spawn pool. Rupters do not spawn in Peaceful mode. The following parasites can also spawn rupters:<br>;;Flying, Light, and Heavy Carriers|Stage I, II, and III Beckons|Stage II, III, and IV Dispatchers|Primative and Adapted Summoners|Overseers|Ancient Dreadnauts;;33% of rupters will spawn as one of two varients: a berserker rupter or a virulent rupter, with both having an equal chance (16.5% of all rupters) to spawn.

The /summon command can be used to spawn rupters:/summon srparasites:rupter This command will spawn varients at their normal rates. Using a Spawn Rupter spawn egg will also spawn a rupter with their variants at a normal rate.

When a rupter dies, it drops:<br><<tableItem|Roll Chance|Quantity||Rupter Viscera|r100%|0--2table>><br>Rupters drop 5 experience points when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

Rupters can chase mobs in a 32-block radius. Rupters can climb walls like spiders and do not take fall damage.<br><br>Rupters will lunge towards mobs they are chasing down, leaping between 10--15 blocks. Rupters will not lunge to cross gaps. Rupturs also make smaller leaps, similar to spiders, when attacking. Rupters will also leap while swimming when chasing mobs.<br><br>When a mob takes damage from a rupter, they will get Call Of The Hive for 3 minutes and Slowness II for 1 second. Berserker rupters will also apply Bleeding for 5 seconds, starting at I and increasing by 1 level per consecutive attack while affected with Bleeding. Virulent rupters will also apply Viral for 5 seconds, starting at I and increasing by 1 level per consecutive attack while affected with Viral.<br><br>If a rupter gets 30 kills, it will evolve into a Mangler. It can spend 5 kills in its kill count to create a Tunnel, which will periodically spawn in more Buglins.<br><br>Before Phase 2, rupters will run away from hostile mobs and players unless they are in groups of 2 or more. When rupters are not attacking or fleeing from hostile mobs or players, they will approach passive mobs and create a small lingering cloud of Call Of The Hive II that lasts 3 minutes.<br><br>Rupters will take 4x the damage inflicted by fire.</div>
