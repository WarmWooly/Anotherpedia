      <h1>Rupter</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with rupture.<br>For the {{aiMinecraft modder, see Rupter (modder).}}<br><<info||Stats||Health (Minecraft)|10 (5 hearts)||Armor (Minecraft)|5||Knockback Resistance (Minecraft)|0.2||Behavior|Hostile||Mob (Minecraft) type|Monster (Minecraft)||Attack strength|3/5/7 (1.5/2.5/3.5 hearts; difficulty (Minecraft) Easy mode (Minecraft)/normal mode (Minecraft)/hard mode (Minecraft))||Hitbox (Minecraft)|0.85 x 0.85 x 1 (lwh in blocks)||Mob spawning (Minecraft)|Evolving from Buglin (Scape and Run: Parasites), natural spawning in Phases 1--5info>>A rupter is a mob (Minecraft) in the Minecraft modding (Minecraft) Scape and Run: Parasites that lunge at other mobs and player (Minecraft), dealing damage (Minecraft) and applying Call Of The Hive (Scape and Run: Parasites). Rupters are likely the first hostile parasites (Scape and Run: Parasites) a player will encounter, evolving from Buglin (Scape and Run: Parasites) or naturally spawning in early Evolution Phases (Scape and Run: Parasites).

Rupters will evolve from Buglin (Scape and Run: Parasites) that have been alive for 75 seconds, which naturally spawn in Evolution Phases (Scape and Run: Parasites). Rupters will naturally spawn in any Dimension (Minecraft) in Phases 1 to 5. Scent (Scape and Run: Parasites) level 0 and 1 will always spawn rupters, while levels 2 and 3 have rupters as a member of the scent's spawn pool. Rupters do not spawn in Peaceful mode (Minecraft). The following parasites can also spawn rupters:<br>;;Flying Carrier (Scape and Run: Parasites), Light Carrier (Scape and Run: Parasites), and Heavy Carrier (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Stage I Beckon (Scape and Run: Parasites), Stage 2 Beckon (Scape and Run: Parasites), and Stage III Beckon (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Stage II Dispatcher (Scape and Run: Parasites), Stage III Dispatcher (Scape and Run: Parasites), and Stage IV Dispatcher (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Primative Summoner (Scape and Run: Parasites) and Adapted Summoner (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Overseer (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Ancient Dreadnaut (Scape and Run: Parasites);;33% of rupters will spawn as one of two varients: a berserker rupter or a virulent rupter, with both having an equal chance (16.5% of all rupters) to spawn.

The /summon (Minecraft) can be used to spawn rupters:/summon srparasites:rupter This command will spawn varients at their normal rates. Using a Spawn Rupter (Scape and Run: Parasites) spawn egg (Minecraft) will also spawn a rupter with their variants at a normal rate.

When a rupter dies, it drops:<br><<tableItem|Roll Chance|Quantity||Rupter Viscera (Scape and Run: Parasites)|r100%|0--2table>><br>Rupters drop 5 experience (Minecraft) points when killed by a player (Minecraft) or tamed wolf (Minecraft).

Rupters can chase mobs in a 32-block radius. Rupters can climb walls like spider (Minecraft) and do not take fall damage.<br><br>Rupters will lunge towards mobs they are chasing down, leaping between 10--15 blocks. Rupters will not lunge to cross gaps. Rupturs also make smaller leaps, similar to spiders, when attacking. Rupters will also leap while swimming when chasing mobs.<br><br>When a mob takes damage from a rupter, they will get Call Of The Hive (Scape and Run: Parasites) for 3 minutes and Slowness (Minecraft) II for 1 second. Berserker rupters will also apply Bleeding (Scape and Run: Parasites) for 5 seconds, starting at I and increasing by 1 level per consecutive attack while affected with Bleeding. Virulent rupters will also apply Viral (Scape and Run: Parasites) for 5 seconds, starting at I and increasing by 1 level per consecutive attack while affected with Viral.<br><br>If a rupter gets 30 kills, it will evolve into a Mangler (Scape and Run: Parasites). It can spend 5 kills in its kill count to create a Tunnel (Scape and Run: Parasites), which will periodically spawn in more Buglin (Scape and Run: Parasites).<br><br>Before Evolution Phases (Scape and Run: Parasites), rupters will run away from hostile mobs and players unless they are in groups of 2 or more. When rupters are not attacking or fleeing from hostile mobs or players, they will approach passive mobs and create a small lingering cloud of Call Of The Hive (Scape and Run: Parasites) II that lasts 3 minutes.<br><br>Rupters will take 4x the damage inflicted by fire (Minecraft).</div>
