Rupters will evolve from Buglin (Scape and Run: Parasites) that have been alive for 75 seconds, which naturally spawn in Evolution Phases (Scape and Run: Parasites). Rupters will naturally spawn in any Dimension (Minecraft) in Phases 1 to 5. Scent (Scape and Run: Parasites) level 0 and 1 will always spawn rupters, while levels 2 and 3 have rupters as a member of the scent's spawn pool.<<note(content=Scents are only active in Phase 5 and above and are caused by killing parasites.(text=noteCountnote>> Rupters do not spawn in Peaceful mode (Minecraft). The following parasites can also spawn rupters:&sp;;Flying Carrier (Scape and Run: Parasites), Light Carrier (Scape and Run: Parasites), and Heavy Carrier (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Stage I Beckon (Scape and Run: Parasites), Stage 2 Beckon (Scape and Run: Parasites), and Stage III Beckon (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Stage II Dispatcher (Scape and Run: Parasites), Stage III Dispatcher (Scape and Run: Parasites), and Stage IV Dispatcher (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Primative Summoner (Scape and Run: Parasites) and Adapted Summoner (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Overseer (Scape and Run: Parasites)|Ancient Dreadnaut (Scape and Run: Parasites);;33% of rupters will spawn as one of two varients: a berserker rupter or a virulent rupter, with both having an equal chance (16.5% of all rupters) to spawn.
The /summon (Minecraft) can be used to spawn rupters: This command will spawn varients at their normal rates. Using a Spawn Rupter (Scape and Run: Parasites) spawn egg (Minecraft) will also spawn a rupter with their variants at a normal rate.
When a rupter dies, it drops:&sp<<tableItem|Roll Chance|Quantity||Rupter Viscera (Scape and Run: Parasites)|r100%|0--2<<note(content=Rupter Viscera drops are unaffected by Looting (Minecraft).(text=noteCountnote>>table>>&spRupters drop 5 experience (Minecraft) points when killed by a player (Minecraft) or tamed wolf (Minecraft).
Rupters can chase mobs in a 32-block radius. Rupters can climb walls like spider (Minecraft) and do not take fall damage.&pRupters will lunge towards mobs they are chasing down, leaping between 10--15 blocks. Rupters will not lunge to cross gaps. Rupturs also make smaller leaps, similar to spiders, when attacking. Rupters will also leap while swimming when chasing mobs.&pWhen a mob takes damage from a rupter, they will get Call Of The Hive (Scape and Run: Parasites) for 3 minutes and Slowness (Minecraft) II for 1 second. Berserker rupters will also apply Bleeding (Scape and Run: Parasites) for 5 seconds, starting at I and increasing by 1 level per consecutive attack while affected with Bleeding. Virulent rupters will also apply Viral (Scape and Run: Parasites) for 5 seconds, starting at I and increasing by 1 level per consecutive attack while affected with Viral.&pIf a rupter gets 30 kills, it will evolve into a Mangler (Scape and Run: Parasites). It can spend 5 kills in its kill count to create a Tunnel (Scape and Run: Parasites), which will periodically spawn in more Buglin (Scape and Run: Parasites).&pBefore Evolution Phases (Scape and Run: Parasites), rupters will run away from hostile mobs and players unless they are in groups of 2 or more.<<note(content=Sometimes, rupters will stay still or even hop towards players or hostile mobs. It will not chase or deal damage when alone below Phase 2.(text=noteCountnote>> When rupters are not attacking or fleeing from hostile mobs or players, they will approach passive mobs and create a small lingering cloud of Call Of The Hive (Scape and Run: Parasites) II that lasts 3 minutes.&pRupters will take 4x the damage inflicted by fire (Minecraft).</div>
