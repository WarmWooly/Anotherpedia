      <h1>Sad (Voidpet)</h1>
      <div>Sad is a Rarity (Voidpet) Water type (Voidpet) Classes (Voidpet) Voidpet (fictional species) based on the emotion of sadness. Sad is also the 2nd Voidpet in the VoidDex and can be selected at the start of Voidpet (franchise) games.

Sad's eye is a thick crescent facing downwards. Its first stage has a pointed tail leading up to a head with a snout. Its second stage adds a smaller set of eyes next to their first ones as they gain a rounded body, simple feet, a tail, and two-pointed wings. Its third stage elongates its neck, adding two strands to the back, each containing an eye. Sad's back hump and tail become more defined as it gains proper legs and three-pointed wings. Its fourth stage removes the legs for a point towards the front and a nub with eyes at the back. Its neck extends further back, with a second pair of wings (now with four points each) and a second tail offshoot. Sad's fifth stage keeps extending its neck until it nearly touches its tail, which now has three strands. Its front point is smoothed out, and the back of its neck now has three neck strands with eyes. The last two eyes are on its head.<br><br>Sads live within ocean and other body of water, starting out with a hard exterior before evolution (Voidpet) dolphin-like skin. They can stay underwater for days at a time, often looking down because of their necks. Those who own Sads should have them look up occasionally to prevent myopia.
