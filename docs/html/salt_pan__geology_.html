      <h1>Salt pan (geology)</h1>
      <div>A salt pan, salt flat, or salt plain, is a natural geographic feature consting of salt and other mineral resulting from a body of water (such as lake) evaporation in a desert. The salt and minerals pile up over time, covering the surface. Nearly all salt pans are white, and many have a cell-like pattern on their surface.</div>
