      <h1>Santa Claus</h1>
      <div><<notice(type=info(content=This article was written under the assumption that the existence of Santa Claus can not be proven or denied. However, Santa Claus is not real. Please keep this in mind and read at your own discretion.notice>>"You better watch out, you better not cry! You better not pout, I'm telling you why, Santa Claus is coming to town!"Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nick, Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, or just Santa, is a legendary figure who is believed to deliver gift to people on the night of Christmas Eve, December 24th.<br><br>The concept of Santa originated from the 4th century Christian bishop Saint Nicholas, known for his generosity and secret gift-giving. The 1823 poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas", written by an unknown author, would influence modern depictions of Santa Claus as a jolly man in a red suit.

Modern depictions of Santa show a large, jolly, white bearded man with a Santa hat. He wears a red coat and pants with white fur trimmings, black boots, and a black belt. He carries a Santa's bag full of presents. He is commonly associated with a deep, hearty laugh, depicted as "Ho, ho, ho!". Some versions of Santa also include him with a pair of reading glasses. Some believe this depiction was created by The Coca-Cola Company in their 1930s ads, though this is untrue.<br><br>Santa lives in his Santa's Workshop in the North Pole, with his wife Mrs. Claus. Santa employs a large number of Christmas elf to construct toys and gifts all year long, and on the night of Christmas Eve, he flies through the sky on a sleigh pulled by 9 magic reindeer. These reindeer are named Dasher, Donner, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Blitzen, Comet, Cupid, and Rudolph. Since the 1940s, Rudolph has commonly been included in this list, primarily from the tale of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Santa keeps track of who is bad and who is good, having a "naughty list" and a "nice list", which he "checks twice". He will leave gifts to those who are on the nice list, and leave lumps of coal instead for those who are on the naughty list.

Those who anticipate Santa’s arrival often follow many preparations. The most important thing is setting up a Christmas tree. This consists of a large Evergreen tree placed in an easily accessible location in the house, and decorating it with sparkly tinsel, string lights, various ornaments (often colorful baubles), and a star on top.<br><br>Another common tradition is to leave out a plate of cookie, with a cup of milk for Santa. Sometimes, carrot will also be left as a snack for Santa's reindeer. People will also hang stockings above the fireplace mantle (or near the tree if there is no fireplace), which Santa will fill with extra goodies.<br><br>On the night of Christmas Eve, Santa visits houses on his sleigh (historically entering through the chimney), and leaves gifts underneath the Christmas tree, and treats in the stockings (or coal if they are on the naughty list). He also eats the cookies and milk left out, and exits, presumably also from the chimney.

<<notice(type=warn(content=This section is a work in progress (Anotherpedia). You can help by how to make/edit pages the page.(img=cdn/anotherpedia logo wip.svgnotice>><br>There is much discourse on whether or not Santa Claus is real. Those who do not believe in Santa instead believe that Santa's gifts are, in fact, left out by parents, whose kids are led to believe they were left by Santa. The most common argument against Santa being real is the fact that Santa simply could not deliver gifts to every single house in the world that celebrates Christmas, nor could he eat all of the cookies left out for him.<br><br>Another argument against Santa's existence is mall Santas, which are workers who dress up and act like Santa in shopping malls during December, asking children what they want for Christmas. Santa believers argue that mall Santas, while not actually being Santa, instead work for Santa to relay requested gifts.</div>
