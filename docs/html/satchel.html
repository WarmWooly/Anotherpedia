  <h1>Satchel</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the explosive, see satchel charge.}}&spA {{bsatchel}} is a type of bag with a strap used to hold object, notably book or other paper document. The satchel is often worn on the opposite hip from the shoulder of where the strap lays, crossing the body. The majority of satchels are constructed of leather, and have some sort of clip or hook to keep the top of the satchel from opening.</div>
