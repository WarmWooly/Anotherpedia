  <h1>Satirical page</h1>
  <div><<shortPage on Anotherpedia covering satireshort>><<img(src=git/satirical page.avif(cap=A person [[laughing]] when they understand a page is satirical.img>>On [[Anotherpedia]], a {{bsatirical page}} is a [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] in which the contents are [[satirical|satire]], as they are discussing a [[topic]] which is not [[serious]] or the page itself is a [[joke]]. It will be noted at the top of the page if the page is satirical, especially in the case where taking the page literally may be [[harmful|harm]] or [[confusion]]. Pages on Anotherpedia are not made to be satirical or [[parody]] (unless we're roleplaying as [[Uncyclopedia]]), but when discussing satire or parody, it may become unclear to [[readers|reader]], so it is helpful to have a note to keep readers well-informed on the content they are reading.</div>
