      <h1>Satirical page</h1>
      <div>On Anotherpedia, a satirical page is a page in which the contents are satirical, as they are discussing a topic which is not serious or the page itself is a joke. It will be noted at the top of the page if the page is satirical, especially in the case where taking the page literally may be harmful or confusion. Pages on Anotherpedia are not made to be satirical or parody (unless we're roleplaying as Uncyclopedia), but when discussing satire or parody, it may become unclear to readers, so it is helpful to have a note to keep readers well-informed on the content they are reading.</div>
