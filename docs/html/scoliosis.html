      <h1>Scoliosis</h1>
      <div><<nomedical>>Scoliosis is a curve in the spine that goes side-to-side instead of front-to-back. Scoliosis is a common medical condition, with over 80% of cases being of unknown origin (known as idiopathic scoliosis), especially in toddlers and adolescence. While scoliosis can be treated, there is no cure for it. Symptoms for scoliosis include back pain, shoulder pain, visible spine curvature and uneven shoulders, and weakness from sitting or standing for long periods of time.</div>
