      <h1>Scolipede</h1>
      <div>Scolipede is a horse-shaped millipede-esque Bug type (Pokémon) and Poison type (Pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation V (Pokémon).

Scolipede has a thick body with a raised millipede-like upper half and horse-like lower half. Its body is comprised of multiple dark magenta segments with a smooth, deep gray underbelly. Its head consists of a sharp downward point for its mouth, yellowish-orange eyes with black pupils, two bent dark magenta horns with three purple stripes each, and dark magenta and deep gray for the top and bottom portions, respectively. Scolipede has eight segments, each sporting a purple drop-like pattern on each side with a hollow center, with the top four segments and the second to last segment having purple claws. Its four legs have deep gray bands pointed downward with similarly colored hooves. The segments have a deep gray triangle from the top pointing downwards along its body. Scolipede's rear boasts an additional set of horns identical to the ones on its head.<br><br>Scolipede's official size is 8 foot (unit) and 2 inch, while weighing 442 pound. Shiny (Pokémon) Scolipedes are red instead of dark magenta with cyan markings instead of purple.<br><br>Scolipede may be a portmanteau of scorpion and millipede.

Scolipede quickly attacks foes and prey, using its horns for attacking and its claws for grasping. The claws can inject poison to finish off what Scolipede has captured. Scolipede can have territorial battles with Centiskorch, with the winner eating the loser.

A Scolipede has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Scolipede is the 545th Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color red.<br><br>Scolipede evolution (pokémon) from Whirlipede at level (Pokémon) 30, which evolves from Venipede at level 22. Scolipede's leveling rate (Pokémon) is "Medium Slow".

When a Scolipede held item (pokémon) Scolipite, it can mega evolution (pokémon) into Mega Scolipede, overall increasing its stats. Mega Scolipede has numerous significant design changes compared to its non-Mega counterpart. Its front horns now have a pair of magenta and black striped horns with glowing teal tips, with its back horns also striped in a similar fashion. The top of its head has become white, its top segment now wraps around the head, dotted with magenta-black circles and a black-teal stripe, and its irises are now teal with teal eye accents. The insides of all the magenta body markings are now black, with the leg bands becoming magenta. The top four body segments are white, with the rest unchanged. Teal stripes also run alongside Mega Scolipede's underbelly. An armor-like white plate now covers the front, with two pointed extrusions. Mega Scolipede's size increases to 10 ft and 6 in., and its weight increases to 508.2 lbs.</div>
