      <h1>SCP-035 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 3 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||HP|1500||WalkSpeed|25||Damage|25|info>>SCP-035, or The Possessive Mask, is a Keter (SCP: Devolved Revamp) SCP (SCP: Devolved Revamp) located within Sector 3 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-035 is a mask with black eyes and black tears streaming down from the mask. When SCP-035 is activated, it becomes a humanoid figure in the Class D (SCP: Devolved Revamp) suit with a knife, wearing the mask. SCP-035 will approach the nearest player (Roblox), jumping or occasionally teleporting while pathfinding. Upon contacting a player, it will damage them. The player does not have to be moving for it to follow them. The team (SCP: Devolved Revamp) of the player does not change SCP-035's behaviour. SCP-035 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-035's room is located within Sector 3 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 035". The room itself has a floor comprised of a dark grey metal pattern, charcoal grey walls, a dark grey ceiling, and several fixtures. There is a desk with one chair and a computer in the corner of the room with file cabinets and a monitor next to it. There are also two lockers and more file cabinets at the back wall of the room, and a viewing fence that divides the containment and viewing rooms. Two LED panel light up the room. The containment room has a glass case in the middle of the room where SCP-035's mask spawns, and the ground around it is a darker shade of grey. Two LED panels light up the room, and near the bottom wall, the number 035 can be seen.</div>
