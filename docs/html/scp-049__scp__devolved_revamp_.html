      <h1>SCP-049 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 3 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||HP|4500||WalkSpeed|25||Damage|1000|info>>SCP-049, or The Plague Doctor, is a Euclid (SCP: Devolved Revamp) SCP (SCP: Devolved Revamp) located within Sector 3 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-049 is a plague doctor with a plain white mask, black eyes, and a black and dark grey plague doctor outfit. SCP-049 will approach the nearest player (Roblox), jumping or occasionally teleporting while pathfinding. Upon contacting a player, it will instantly kill them and create a zombie (SCP: Devolved Revamp). The player does not have to be moving for it to follow them. The team (SCP: Devolved Revamp) of the player does not change SCP-049's behaviour. SCP-049 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-049's room is located within Sector 3 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 049". The room itself has a floor comprised of a dark grey metal pattern, charcoal grey walls, a dark grey ceiling, and several fixtures. A desk with one chair and a computer can be seen with multiple testing flasks and scientific tools on the desk as well. Several file cabinets with a monitor on top can be seen right next to the desk, and more cabinets and a locker can be seen in the corner of the viewing room. Two LED panel light up the viewing room, and a viewing fence is on the wall between the containment and viewing rooms. A door leads to SCP-049's containment room, where two medical beds and a singular medical curtain can be seen. There are also two cabinet tables with various scientific tools on top of them. A whiteboard can also be seen on the wall of the containment room, and two LED panels light up the room. Near the bottom of the wall in the room, the number 049 can be seen.</div>
