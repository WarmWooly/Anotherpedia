      <h1>SCP-066 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 2||HP|750||WalkSpeed|10||Damage|0|info>>SCP-066, or Eric's Toy, is a Safe SCP located within Sector 2 of the Facility in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-066 is a red spaghetti-like blob with eyeballs all over that is always asking "eric?" Its several blue eyes are scattered across its body. SCP-066 will approach the nearest player, jumping or occasionally teleporting while pathing. Upon contacting a player, it will proceed to get red bloodshot eyes while extending some of its body strands out. The player must be moving for it to follow them. The team of the player does not change SCP-066's behaviour. SCP-066 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-066's room is located within Sector 2 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 066". The room itself has a floor comprised of a dark grey metal pattern, charcoal grey walls, a dark grey ceiling, and several fixtures. A gray box on hydraulics sits in the left corner of the viewing room. A pair of buttons, one blue and one red, lies on a control panel with the Keycard scanner to the containment room and the door to the room on the right of the control panel. The middle of the room has the containment box where SCP-066 spawns, and the hydraulics can be seen coming through the wall and on the roof of the containment room. There is also a red line inside the containment room between the door and SCP-066's box. The two rooms together are lit with three LED panels in total. When the red button is pressed on the control panel, the hydraulics activate, lifting the box covering SCP-066 and starting a testing session. Testing sessions end after a player presses the red button a second time after the initial press. The blue button... does nothing because the Facility is broke. :(</div>
