      <h1>SCP-096 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 4 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||HP|10000||WalkSpeed|25||Damage|1000|info>>SCP-096, or The Shy Guy, is a Keter (SCP Foundation) SCP (SCP: Devolved Revamp) located within Sector 3 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-096 is a tall, skinny white humanoid creature that is always sitting with it's hands covering its face in a docile crying state, and a pair of white eyes when chasing players. SCP-096 will sit still in its cell until a  player (Roblox) stares at it for 5 seconds until it is aggravated, then it will chase the player around the map until that player is terminated before going back to its default position. SCP-096 can be seen jumping or occasionally teleporting while pathfinding. Upon contacting a player, it will instantly kill them. The team (SCP: Devolved Revamp) of the player does not change SCP-096's behaviour. SCP-096 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-096's room is located within Sector 3 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 096". The room itself has a small area comprised of file cabinet and computer as well as a two-person desk and the 096 testing button on the wall in the middle of the room. There are also 3 LED panel to light up the room. The gate to the containment room is a normal SCP gate, but with two big metal panels on each side, and the walls connected to the gate are made out of a fence that cannot be bypassed, but can be used to look into the containment cell. When entering the containment part of the room, there is an elevated viewing area with a dark grey handrail protecting the player from falling over, with a small ramp that leads down into the cell on the right. In the center of the room is a large dark grey containment box that hangs from a rope that covers SCP-096. When the red testing button is pressed, the two doors leading into SCP-096's room get blocked by a solid metal door, as well as the gate into the containment room and the two fences on the containment room gates' wall that cannot be opened until the testing session is over. Testing sessions take 7.5 minutes to end or until someone presses the red button again, reopening the closed metal doors. 7 LED panels light up the containment room with one small wall light on each side of the containment room.</div>
