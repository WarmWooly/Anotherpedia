      <h1>SCP-173 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 2||HP|7500||WalkSpeed|100||Damage|1000|info>>SCP-173, or The Sculpture, is a Euclid SCP located within Sector 3 of the Facility in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-173 is a tall animate humanoid statue. SCP-173 is made from concrete, rebar, and spray paint. SCP-173 has four eyes, all lime green, as well as a red mark around its face. Once SCP-173's containment cell is open, it will teleport to the nearest player that looks at it, then looks away, and if there is no one else observing, it will instantly kill the player upon teleporting to them. The player does not have to be moving for it to teleport to them; the only condition is that no player can be looking at it. The team of the player does not change SCP-173's behaviour. SCP-173 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-173's room is located within Sector 3 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 173". The room itself has a floor comprised of a dark grey metal pattern, charcoal grey walls, a dark grey ceiling, and several fixtures. There is a desk with a computer and a chair in the room with several file cabinets next to it, and a computer on top of the cabinets. There are three storage containers in the corner of the room with two LED panels to light up the room and a door leading to a small hallway with one LED panel to light it up and the door to SCP-173's containment room. Inside SCP-173's containment room, there is one LED panel to light it up and a viewing fence that cannot be seen through on the wall. On one of the walls in the containment room, the number 173 can be seen near the bottom of the wall.</div>
