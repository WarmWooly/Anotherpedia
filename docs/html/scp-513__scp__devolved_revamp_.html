      <h1>SCP-513 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 2 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||HP|Unknown||WalkSpeed|Unknown||Damage|Unknown|info>>SCP-513, or A Cowbell, is a Euclid (SCP: Devolved Revamp) SCP (SCP: Devolved Revamp) located within Sector 2 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-513 is a rusted cowbell that sits inside a class container inside its containment room. SCP-513 is currently stationary and inactive.

SCP-513's room is located within Sector 2 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 513". The room itself has a floor comprised of a dark grey metal pattern, charcoal grey walls, and a dark grey ceiling. There is a small control panel that can be seen that opens the door into SCP-513's containment room, and there is also one LED panel that lights up the room. Inside the containment room, the floor is still comprised of the same material, but the walls in the room are a darker grey padding, which the player (Roblox) can climbing (Roblox). In the center of the containment room, a pedestal with a glass casing can be seen where SCP-513 spawns. Two wall-mounted lights provide the room's light source.</div>
