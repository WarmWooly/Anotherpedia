      <h1>SCP-682 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 4 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||HP|15000||WalkSpeed|25||Damage|1000|info>>SCP-682, or Hard-to-Destroy Reptile, is a Keter (SCP: Devolved Revamp) SCP (SCP: Devolved Revamp) located within Sector 3 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-682 is a large decaying reptile-like creature. SCP-682 has long black hair that covers most of its body and has a skull for a head. SCP-682 also has multiple decaying and wounded spots on its body, most notably its stomach, where the rib cage is visible. SCP-682 will rapidly approach the nearest player (Roblox), occasionally jumping while pathfinding. Upon contacting a player, it will instantly kill the player and then proceed to chase the next closest player. The player does not have to be moving for it to chase them. The team (SCP: Devolved Revamp) of the player does not change SCP-682's behaviour. SCP-682 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-682's room is located within Sector 3 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 682". The room itself has a floor comprised of a dark grey metal pattern, charcoal grey walls, a dark grey ceiling, and several fixtures. There are three storage container in the corner of the room and several file cabinet next to a desk with testing flasks and a computer. There is a computer on top of the file cabinets and two chairs at the desk. There is a viewing fence to view between the room and the containment room of SCP-682. Two big SCP doors with metal reinforcement sit in the room as the divider between the viewing room and containment room. Three LED panel light up the room. Two tall, slim gray platforms with a button on each can be seen, both activating the two doors to enter SCP-682's containment room. Inside the containment room, there is a ramp with a handrail that leads into a green pool of liquid where SCP-682 spawns. There is one wall light on the left and right walls inside the containment room, and six LED panels that light up the room.</div>
