      <h1>SCP-999 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div>SCP-999, or The Tickle Monster, is a Safe SCP located within Sector 2 of the Facility in SCP: Devolved Revamp.
SCP-999 is an orange blob that always has a derpy smile, a pair of black eyes, and arms when hugging. SCP-999 will approach the nearest player, jumping or occasionally teleporting while pathing. Upon contacting a player, it will proceed to hug them, restoring health to all nearby players. The player must be moving or hurt for it to follow/hug. The team of the player does not change SCP-999's behaviour. SCP-999 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.
SCP-999's room is located within Sector 2 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 999". The room itself has a floor comprised of a checkerboard pattern of light and dark green, blue walls and ceiling with painted stars, and several fixtures. A gray pen sits in the middle, where SCP-999 spawns. A pair of 3-person benches lay to the sides, with a potted plant in three of the four corners. The far-left corner has a refrigerator, including SCP-999 magnets (such as the one from Classic). The room is lit with two LED panels.
SCP-999 appears in other parts of SCP: Devolved Revamp, including being a mascot for the game's icon. SCP-999 also appears on whiteboards as a doodle and as a magnet on the kitchen fridge.</div>
