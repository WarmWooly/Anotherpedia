      <h1>SCP-999 (SCP: Devolved Revamp)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Access|Level 1 Keycard (SCP: Devolved Revamp)||HP|500||WalkSpeed|12||Damage|0||Heals|10 HP|info>>SCP-999, or The Tickle Monster, is a Safe (SCP: Devolved Revamp) SCP (SCP: Devolved Revamp) located within Sector 2 of the Map (SCP: Devolved Revamp) in SCP: Devolved Revamp.

SCP-999 is an orange blob that always has a derpy smile, a pair of black eyes, and arms when hugging. SCP-999 will approach the nearest player (Roblox), jumping or occasionally teleporting while pathfinding. Upon contacting a player, it will proceed to hug them, restoring health (Roblox) to all nearby players. The player must be moving or hurt for it to follow/hug. The team (SCP: Devolved Revamp) of the player does not change SCP-999's behaviour. SCP-999 can be shot and killed, but it will respawn shortly thereafter.

SCP-999's room is located within Sector 2 of the Facility, with the door marked with "scp 999". The room itself has a floor comprised of a checkerboard pattern of light and dark green, blue walls and ceiling with painted star (symbol), and several fixtures. A gray pen sits in the middle, where SCP-999 spawns. A pair of 3-person benches lay to the sides, with a potted plant in three of the four corners. The far-left corner has a refrigerator, including SCP-999 magnets (such as the one from SCP-999 (SCP: Devolved Classic)). The room is lit with two LED panel.

SCP-999 appears in other parts of SCP: Devolved Revamp, including being a mascot for the game's icon. SCP-999 also appears on whiteboard as a doodle and as a magnet on the kitchen fridge.</div>
