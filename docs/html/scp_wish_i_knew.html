      <h1>SCP Wish I Knew</h1>
      <div>SCP Wish I Knew or Ooh Wish I Knew is a internet meme originally created by Zachary Aghaizu on TikTok in December 2025 to promote his music album SO CHOPPED. The meme depicts a black-and-white potentially-generative artificial intelligence floating head with white glowing eyes lip sync to the song "OOH WISH I KNEW!" on a black background. It would be used in various memes in reference to the SCP Foundation as if it were an SCP (SCP Foundation) (an anomaly creature) and become incorporated in brainrot. Within memes, it is either what someone transformation after an event or something that chases the poster of the meme. An example is the following:"Me lowkirkenuinly crash out at homeboy 6-7 (meme) times before turning into SCP Wish I Knew and degloving (meme) them"</div>
