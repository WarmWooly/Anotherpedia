      <h1>Seals (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Seals are Modifiers that can be added to playing cards in Balatro. Only one Seal can be on a card at a time. If a new Seal is added to a card that already has one, the previous Seal will be overwritten. Purchasing cards from the Store or from booster packs are ways to get cards with Seals, but they may also come from Spectral Cards. There are a total of 4 different Seals.<<tableName|Effect||Gold Seal|Gives $3 when scored.||Red Seal|Retriggers the card (as if there were two of them). This includes activating effects while in the hand (such as a Gold Card earning money) and when played in a poker hand.||Blue Seal|Creates a Planet Card based on the last played hand when held in hand. Requires room to create it.||Purple Seal|Creates a random Tarot Card when discarded. Requires room to create it. Discards from The Hook Boss Blind also count.table>></div>
