      <h1>Search history SQL file</h1>
      <div>Most web browsers store a user's search history on an SQL file. These are made for local storage of a search history, and are affected by in-browser tools such as search history wiping and private browsing.<br><br>A user is able to query through the file, which is able to be used to get statistics or information on someone's search habit. The SQL file is usually stored in the same place across devices, allowing for easy access by software.</div>
