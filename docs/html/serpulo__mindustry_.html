      <h1>Serpulo (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>Serpulo is a fictional planet in the game Mindustry and is currently the largest planet in the campaign. Serpulo was added to the game in version 5.0 to replace the previous campaign system. It's landscape is covered in mountains, tundras, salt plains, deserts, oceans, and spore-filled plains. The enemy faction Crux has control of the planet at the start of the game, with the main objective to create an Interplanetary Accelerator to spread to other planets (such as Erekir).

More information: List of sectors on Serpluo<br>There are 272 sectors which can be taken over, with 18 required for the Tech Tree (which are hand-made) and 254 that are optional (which are automatically generated). Sectors near the equator are often easy to control, offering little resistance to mid-game players. This region is often filled with Copper, Lead, Sand, and Coal. As sectors get closer to the poles, the difficulty increases, where Titanium and Thorium can be found.<br><br>Enemy bases can be found across the map, but are more concentrated toward the poles. These enemy bases are able to recapture sectors that a player captured, occasionally launching more waves of enemies to defend against. While sectors are under attack (either from waves from traditional survival sectors or waves sent by nearby enemy bases), there will be a background algorithm that calculates how many waves the player's base can survive.</div>
