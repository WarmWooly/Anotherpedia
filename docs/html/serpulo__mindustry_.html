      <h1>Serpulo (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>Serpulo is a fictional planet in the indie game Mindustry and is currently the largest planet in the campaign (Mindustry). Serpulo was added to the game in 5.0 (Mindustry) to replace the previous campaign system. It's landscape is covered in mountain, tundra, salt plain, desert, ocean, and spore (Mindustry) plains. The enemy factions (Mindustry) Crux (Mindustry) has control of the planet at the start of the game, with the main objective to create an Interplanetary Accelerator (Mindustry) to spread to other planets (such as Erekir (Mindustry)).

More information: List of sectors on Serpluo<br>There are 272 sector (Mindustry) which can be taken over, with 18 required for the Tech Tree (Mindustry) (which are hand-made) and 254 that are optional (which are sector generation (Mindustry)). Sectors near the equator are often easy to control, offering little resistance to mid-game player. This region is often filled with Copper (Mindustry), Lead (Mindustry), Sand (Mindustry), and Coal (Mindustry). As sectors get closer to the pole (planet), the difficulty increases, where Titanium (Mindustry) and Thorium (Mindustry) can be found.<br><br>Enemy bases can be found across the map, but are more concentrated toward the poles. These enemy bases are able to recapture sectors that a player captured, occasionally launching more waves of enemies to defend against. While sectors are under attack (either from wave (Mindustry) from traditional survival sectors or waves sent by nearby enemy bases), there will be a sector algorithm (Mindustry) that calculates how many waves the player's base can survive.</div>
