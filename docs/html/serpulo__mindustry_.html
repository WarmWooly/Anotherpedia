  <h1>Serpulo ({{iMindustry}})</h1>
  <div><<shortFictional planet in {{iMindustry}}short>><<img(src=git/serpulo.png(cap=Serpulo [[orbiting|orbit]] around its [[star]].img>>{{bSerpulo}} is a [[fictional]] [[planet]] in the [[game|indie game]] {{i[[Mindustry]]}} and is currently the largest planet in the [[campaign|campaign (Mindustry)]]. Serpulo was added to the game in [[version 5.0|5.0 (Mindustry)]] to replace the previous campaign system. It's [[landscape]] is covered in [[mountains|mountain]], [[tundras|tundra]], [[salt plains|salt plain]], [[deserts|desert]], [[oceans|ocean]], and [[spore-filled|spore (Mindustry)]] [[plains|plains]]. The enemy [[faction|factions (Mindustry)]] [[Crux|Crux (Mindustry)]] has control of the planet at the start of the game, with the main objective to create an [[Interplanetary Accelerator|Interplanetary Accelerator (Mindustry)]] to spread to other planets (such as [[Erekir|Erekir (Mindustry)]]).<<hrSectorshr>>{{tMore information: [[List of sectors on Serpluo]]}}&spThere are 272 [[sectors|sector (Mindustry)]] which can be taken over, with 18 required for the [[Tech Tree|Tech Tree (Mindustry)]] (which are hand-made) and 254 that are optional (which are [[automatically generated|sector generation (Mindustry)]]). Sectors near the [[equator]] are often easy to control, offering little resistance to mid-game [[players|player]]. This region is often filled with [[Copper|Copper (Mindustry)]], [[Lead|Lead (Mindustry)]], [[Sand|Sand (Mindustry)]], and [[Coal|Coal (Mindustry)]]. As sectors get closer to the [[poles|pole (planet)]], the difficulty increases, where [[Titanium|Titanium (Mindustry)]] and [[Thorium|Thorium (Mindustry)]] can be found.&pEnemy bases can be found across the map, but are more concentrated toward the poles. These enemy bases are able to recapture sectors that a player captured, occasionally launching more waves of enemies to defend against. While sectors are under attack (either from [[waves|wave (Mindustry)]] from traditional survival sectors or waves sent by nearby enemy bases), there will be a [[background algorithm|sector algorithm (Mindustry)]] that calculates how many waves the player's base can survive.</div>
