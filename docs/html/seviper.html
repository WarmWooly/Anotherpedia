      <h1>Seviper</h1>
      <div>Seviper is a viper-like Poison type Pokémon from the third generation.
Seviper has a black-ish covering of scales with an assortment of markings, including small yellow protuberances (bumps) along its belly, yellow hexagons with ovals inside along its back and top of its head, a small purple stripe near the end of its tail, and a large purple mark vaguely resembling a scar under its head. At the end of Seviper's body is a sharp triangular blade with a small cutout facing inward and a red edge outward. Seviper's jaw is yellow with two large red fangs extending downwards. The left side of its face is marked in purple. Seviper has two red eyes with yellow markings roughly around/above them. Seviper is often scrunched up, but it can extend its body into a flattened position.&pSeviper's official size is 8 ft and 10 in., while weighing 115.7 lbs. Shiny Sevipers have green replace yellow, magenta replace purple, and blue replace red, with no changes to the body color.&pSeviper's name is a portmanteau of sever (or something similar) and viper.
Seviper's tail acts as a sharp blade that is able to secrete a lethal venom. It sharpens its tail on rocks to prepare for battle. Seviper tends to hide in tall grasses to strike prey with its fangs or blade. Sevipers and Zangeese are considered "mortal enemies" spanning generations, constantly fighting each other.
A Seviper has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Seviper is the 336th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color black.&pSeviper has no evolutions.</div>
