      <h1>Shape</h1>
      <div>A shape is any representation of a boundary of an object, being distinct from its color or material. In regard to geometry, the location, scale, and orientation are not considered when determining a shape. Shapes can be in any dimension, such as a 0-dimentional point, a 1-dimensional line, a 2-dimensional square, a 3-dimensional cube, or a 4-dimension tesseract.</div>
