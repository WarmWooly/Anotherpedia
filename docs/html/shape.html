  <h1>Shape</h1>
  <div>A {{bshape}} is any representation of a boundary of an object, being distinct from its color or material. In regard to geometry, the location, scaling (geometry), and orientation (geometry) are not considered when determining a shape. Shapes can be in any dimension, such as a zero dimension point (geometry), a one dimension line (geometry), a two dimension square, a three dimension cube, or a four dimension tesseract.</div>
