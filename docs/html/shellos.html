  <h1>Shellos</h1>
  <div>{{bShellos}} is a sea slug-like water type (pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation IV (Pokémon).
Shellos resembles a slug with a pair of black eyes adorned with yellow rings. Its mouth and separation from its underbelly is also yellow, while having a tiny dot nose and four legs. West Sea Shellos have a white underbelly and a pink top, while East Sea Shellos have a light green underbelly and a cyan top. West Sea Shellos also have several small spikes on its back, alongside six lobes with a darkened end on its head, while East Sea Shellos share a pair of flaps lined in yellow with two horn-like tentacles with white tips on its head.&pShellos' official size is 1 foot (unit), while weighing 13.9 Pound. shiny (pokémon) Shellos have a golden trim instead of yellow, with West Sea Shellos more red then pink and East Sea Shellos a lighter blue and yellower green.&pIt is likely that Shellos is a portmanteau of {{ishell}} and {{iloss}}, as it does not have a shell.
Shellos is most often located at shoreline, feeding off of plankton in the sea. They can go across land, but will dry out over time. When squeezing or in danger, they can produce a sticky, yet harmless, purple goo to dissuade attackers. They used to have shell, but devolve them. They are also able to regeneration at a fast rate.&pWhen Mount Coronet (pokémon) formed, it physically separated two population of Shellos, which underwent allopatric speciation. Despite this, there are no changes besides aesthetics.
Shellos has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Shellos is the 422nd Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color purple or blue (form-dependent).&pAt leveling (pokémon) 30, Shellos evolves into Gastrodon (pokémon), which will be in its West and East Sea form respectively. Shellos' leveling rate is "Medium Fast".</div>
