  <div><<short422nd Water type Pokémonshort>><<img(src=git/shellos.png(cap=West Sea Shellos (left) and East Sea Shellos (right).img>>{{bShellos}} is a [[sea slug]]-like [[Water type|water type (pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] from the [[fourth generation|Generation IV (Pokémon)]].<<hrAppearance and naminghr>><<img(src=git/shellos group.gif(cap=A cornucopia of West Sea Shellos.img>>Shellos resembles a [[slug]] with a pair of black eyes adorned with yellow rings. Its mouth and separation from its underbelly is also yellow, while having a tiny dot nose and four legs. West Sea Shellos have a white underbelly and a pink top, while East Sea Shellos have a light green underbelly and a cyan top. West Sea Shellos also have several small spikes on its back, alongside six lobes with a darkened end on its head, while East Sea Shellos share a pair of flaps lined in yellow with two horn-like tentacles with white tips on its head.&pShellos' official size is 1 [[ft|foot (unit)]], while weighing 13.9 [[lbs|Pound]]. [[Shiny|shiny (pokémon)]] Shellos have a golden trim instead of yellow, with West Sea Shellos more red then pink and East Sea Shellos a lighter blue and yellower green.&pIt is likely that Shellos is a [[portmanteau]] of {{ishell}} and {{iloss}}, as it does not have a shell.<<hrBehaviorhr>>Shellos is most often located at [[shorelines|shoreline]], feeding off of [[plankton]] in the [[sea]]. They can go across land, but will dry out over time. When [[squeezed|squeezing]] or in [[danger]], they can produce a [[sticky]], yet [[harmless]], purple [[goo]] to [[dissuade]] attackers. They used to have [[shells|shell]], but [[devolved|devolve]] them. They are also able to [[regenerate|regeneration]] at a fast rate.&pWhen [[Mount Coronet|Mount Coronet (pokémon)]] formed, it physically separated two [[populations|population]] of Shellos, which underwent [[allopatric speciation]]. Despite this, there are no changes besides aesthetics.<<hrGame mechanicshr>>Shellos has a 50/50 chance to be [[male]] or [[female]]. Shellos is the 422nd Pokémon in the [[Pokédex|Pokédex (Pokémon)]] and has the Pokédex color purple or blue (form-dependent).&pAt [[level|leveling (pokémon)]] 30, Shellos [[evolves]] into [[Gastrodon|Gastrodon (pokémon)]], which will be in its West and East Sea form respectively. Shellos' leveling rate is "Medium Fast".</div>
