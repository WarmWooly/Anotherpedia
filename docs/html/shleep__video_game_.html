      <h1>Shleep (video game)</h1>
      <div>{{iShleep}} is an incremental game produced by Bippinbits and released onto itch.io. Shleep was created in Godot (game engine) and made for the Ludum Dare 57 game jam with the game jam theme "Depths" in April 2025. Shleep has the player create a setup to counting sheep, with the goal to make the protagonist fall asleep. As the game progresses, the player can add more sheep, upgrade and build structures, buy defenses against wolf, and handle other challenges thrown at the player as they try to amass more jumps.
