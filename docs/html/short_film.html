      <h1>Short film</h1>
      <div>A short film is a film with a shorter film runtime than normal films. While the length of what is considered a "short film" can vary, 40 minute tends to be the max for the "short" consideration. Due to the reduced time in the film, the filmmaker must work around the restrictions to pass on their creative vision without the same amount of time to allow the audience to be plot investment in the plot and character.</div>
