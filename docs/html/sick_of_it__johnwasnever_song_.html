  <h1>Sick of It (JohnWasNever song)</h1>
  <div><<short2024 Suno.ai song related to KSI's "Thick of It"short>><<img(src=git/sick of it doawk.jpg(cap=The [[thumbnail]] for "Sick of It".img>>"{{bSick of It}}" is a [[song]] written by [[JohnWasNever]] and created through [[Suno.ai]] in response to [[KSI's|KSI]] [[single|single (music)]] "[[Thick of It|Thick of It (KSI song)]]" that premiered in a {{i[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]}} [[fanfic]] called "DoaWK: Thick of It". In JohnWasNever's reading of the fanfic, the song premiered as [[Greg Heffley]] was "spitting fire bars" to unfreeze his fellow students who were frozen by KSI singing "Thick of It" on October 23, 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rj_nDd-cWU(text=refCountref>> A separate [[lyric video]] of just the song was released 5 days after on October 28.&p<<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GJdo1gXC-I(cap=The lyric video for "Sick of It".yt>>The song is generally hostile in tone, attacking KSI, [[Mr. Beast]], [[Lunchly]], [[Prime]], and "Thick of It". Many of the insults throughout the song relate to [[pop culture]], including the [[podcast]] {{i[[Talk Tuah with Haliey Welch]]}} and mentioning the [[YouTuber]] [[MoistCr1TiKaL]]. The use of the [[AI songwriter]] Suno.ai also brings in [[ethical concerns|Ethics of AI in music]] related to the intentions of the song, potentially being made to solely capitalize on the negative reception of KSI's "Thick of It".<<hrLyricshr>>Lunchly to the Thick of It,&spI'm sick of it, get rid of it!&pQuit wasting your time,&spComing up with rhymes,&spIt should be a crime,&spTo drink nasty Prime!&pI know you be tryin'&spThese snacks you be supplyin'&spBut now you just be lyin'&spNow you go on Twitter and start cryin'!&pWoah-oh-oh&spI'm sick of it&spWoah-oh-oh&spI'm sick of it&pWhen you collabed with the beast,&spYour fanbase started to decrease&spSomeone should call a priest,&spBecause Lunchly might as well be yeast!&pFrom the pen to the king?&spI know my criticism might sting,&spYou're not pulling any strings&spWhen I'm done with you, you're gonna be wearing a sling&pYou're career is over, you're stale,&spNow you're looking pale,&spAs soon as you go to jail,&spYou're mother's gonna get railed!
