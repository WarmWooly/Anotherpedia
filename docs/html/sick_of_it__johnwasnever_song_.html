      <h1>Sick of It (JohnWasNever song)</h1>
      <div>"Sick of It" is a song written by JohnWasNever and created through Suno.ai in response to KSI's single "Thick of It" that premiered in a Diary of a Wimpy Kid fanfic called "DoaWK: Thick of It". In JohnWasNever's reading of the fanfic, the song premiered as Greg Heffley was "spitting fire bars" to unfreeze his fellow students who were frozen by KSI singing "Thick of It" on October 23, 2024. A separate lyric video of just the song was released 5 days after on October 28.<br><br>The song is generally hostile in tone, attacking KSI, Mr. Beast, Lunchly, Prime, and "Thick of It". Many of the insults throughout the song relate to pop culture, including the podcast Talk Tuah with Haliey Welch and mentioning the YouTuber MoistCr1TiKaL. The use of the AI songwriter Suno.ai also brings in ethical concerns related to the intentions of the song, potentially being made to solely capitalize on the negative reception of KSI's "Thick of It".
