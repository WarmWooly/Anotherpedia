      <h1>Sick Of It (Rizz Records song)</h1>
      <div>"Sick Of It" was a parody of KSI's "Thick of It" written by Rizz Records composed by an AI songwriter and accompanied by subpar AI videos, released on October 3, 2024. The song was later taken down from YouTube.

Ain't no sin<br>You're just salty when I win<br>See, I believe that this lunch kit's just the start<br>Your girl, I stacked her, while I'm climbing in the charts<br><br>Woah-oh-oh<br>This is how the drama rose<br>Woah-oh-oh<br>I guess this is how the drama rose</div>
