The sieve dropper can be crafted with 1 sort dropper and 4 blocks of iron chains (place the dropper in the middle, surround with chains).
Main page: Sieving ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}&spSieve droppers require a chain conveyor to be placed above them before they will detect items flowing over. They take items that flow above the sieve dropper, determine if the item meets the set criteria, and then sieve it below if the item is the one being checked for. Right-clicking the sieve dropper will open up its menu. Sieve droppers have 9 slots that can each hold an item to be sieved. If the Filter Type is set to "Whitelist", it will sieve items that match one of the items in the slots. If the Filter Type is set to "Blacklist", it will sieve items that do not match any of the items in the slots. There is an additional slot to place a sieve mesh. Automatically sieving uses durability of the sieve mesh. Particles can be disabled using the "Particles" button.
If a player is standing under a sieve dropper when it is producing experience (by sieving sculk with an iron sieve mesh), they will be awarded the advancement Shower, NOW!</div>
