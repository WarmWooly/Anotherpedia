Main page: Sieving ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}<br>Sieve droppers require a chain conveyor to be placed above them before they will detect items flowing over. They take items that flow above the sieve dropper, determine if the item meets the set criteria, and then sieve it below if the item is the one being checked for. Right-clicking the sieve dropper will open up its menu. Sieve droppers have 9 slots that can each hold an item to be sieved. If the Filter Type is set to "Whitelist", it will sieve items that match one of the items in the slots. If the Filter Type is set to "Blacklist", it will sieve items that do not match any of the items in the slots. There is an additional slot to place a sieve meshes (Not Lazy Chainmail). Automatically sieving uses durability (Minecraft) of the sieve mesh. Particles can be disabled using the "Particles" button.

If a player is standing under a sieve dropper when it is producing experience (Not Lazy Chainmail) (by sieving sculk (Minecraft) with an iron sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail)), they will be awarded the advancement (Minecraft) Shower, NOW! (Not Lazy Chainmail)</div>
