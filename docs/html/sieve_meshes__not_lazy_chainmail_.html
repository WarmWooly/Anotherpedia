  <h1>Sieve meshes (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|1||Durability (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>Sieve meshes are a type of item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail. There are three tiers of sieve mesh: iron sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail), rose gold sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail), and iron composite sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail).
Iron and rose gold sieve meshes can be crafting (Minecraft) with 8 stick (Minecraft) surrounding an iron chain carpet (Not Lazy Chainmail) or rose gold chain carpet (Not Lazy Chainmail) respectively. The iron composite sieve mesh has 8 obsidian (Minecraft) surrounding an iron composite chain carpet (Not Lazy Chainmail).
For the sieving loot table and applicable blocks, see sieving ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}&spHold the sieve mesh in the offhand (Minecraft) with the block to be sieved in the main hand (Minecraft). Upon using the sieve mesh, the block will be consumed, and any items collected will be placed in the inventory (Minecraft) or on the ground if there is not enough space. The drops from the block are dependent on the sieve mesh used.
The Sieve Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically sieve items that pass above on a chain conveyor (Not Lazy Chainmail). By inputting a sieve mesh, the valid blocks will automatically be sieved and dropped below. The sieve mesh will still lose durability while in a sieve dropper.
A sieve mesh can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), and Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft).
Multiple runes (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be cast onto sieve meshes:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Automated Permanence Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Automated Permanence (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3 levels|I||Separation Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)<<note(content=Separation is mutually exclusive from Automated Permanence and Unbreaking.(text=noteCountnote>>|Separation (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r5 levels|II||Quick Erosion Rune (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Quick Erosion (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3 levels|Itable>></div>
