      <h1>Sieve meshes (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>Sieve meshes are a type of item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. There are three tiers of sieve mesh: iron, rose gold, and iron composite.
Iron and rose gold sieve meshes can be crafted with 8 sticks surrounding an iron or rose gold chain carpet respectively. The iron composite sieve mesh has 8 obsidian surrounding an iron composite chain carpet.
For the sieving loot table and applicable blocks, see sieving ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail).}}&spHold the sieve mesh in the offhand with the block to be sieved in the main hand. Upon using the sieve mesh, the block will be consumed, and any items collected will be placed in the inventory or on the ground if there is not enough space. The drops from the block are dependent on the sieve mesh used.
The Sieve Dropper is a block that can be used to automatically sieve items that pass above on a chain conveyor. By inputting a sieve mesh, the valid blocks will automatically be sieved and dropped below. The sieve mesh will still lose durability while in a sieve dropper.
A sieve mesh can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, and Curse of Vanishing, using an enchanted book on an anvil.
Multiple runes can be cast onto sieve meshes:<<tableRune|Enchantment|Level cost|Max level||Automated Permanence Rune|Automated Permanence|r3 levels|I||Separation Rune<<note(content=Separation is mutually exclusive from Automated Permanence and Unbreaking.(text=noteCountnote>>|Separation|r5 levels|II||Quick Erosion Rune|Quick Erosion|r3 levels|Itable>></div>
