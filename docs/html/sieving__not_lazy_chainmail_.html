  <h1>Sieving (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
  <div>{{bSieving}} is a process to turn block (Minecraft) into more valuable item (Minecraft) in the {{iMinecraft}} mod (Minecraft) {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}}. There are three tiers of sieving, using the iron sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail), rose gold sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail), and iron composite sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail) sieve meshes (Not Lazy Chainmail) respectively. Holding a sievable block with a sieve mesh in the offhand will destroy the block and give it a chance to return items based on the tier of the mesh. Not every tier is a direct improvement from the one prior, as certain items are only available at certain tiers. There are a maximum of four unique items that can be dropped from sieving. The following is a table of all the products that can be obtained from sieving:<<table{{bBlock}}|{{bIron}}|{{bRose Gold}}|{{bIron Composite}}||Clay (Minecraft)|75% clay ball (Minecraft)&sp60% clay

When manually sieving, the effect (Minecraft) Luck (Minecraft) and Bad Luck (Minecraft) will impact the chance a drop will be given. If the player sieving has both Luck and Bad Luck, Luck will be applied first, followed by Bad Luck. For every level of Luck the player has, the chance for a drop will increase to {{codeoriginal chance * (level of Luck + 2)}}<<note(content=The level of status effects internally starts at 0, so +2 accounts for this offset. An effect at level 1 would read as 0, so Luck I = 0, II = 1, and so on.(text=noteCountnote>> (ex. a drop with a 10% chance will increase to 20% with Luck I, 30% with Luck II, and so on). For every level of Bad Luck the player has, the chance for a drop will decrease to {{codeoriginal chance / (level of Bad Luck + 2)}} (ex. a drop with a 10% chance will decrease to 5% with Bad Luck I, ~3% with Bad Luck II, and so on).
