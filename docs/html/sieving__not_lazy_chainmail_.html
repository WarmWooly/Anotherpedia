      <h1>Sieving (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div>Sieving is a process to turn blocks into more valuable items in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. There are three tiers of sieving, using the iron, rose gold, and iron composite sieve meshes respectively. Holding a sievable block with a sieve mesh in the offhand will destroy the block and give it a chance to return items based on the tier of the mesh. Not every tier is a direct improvement from the one prior, as certain items are only available at certain tiers. There are a maximum of four unique items that can be dropped from sieving. The following is a table of all the products that can be obtained from sieving:<<tableBlock|Iron|Rose Gold|Iron Composite||Clay|75% clay ball&sp60% clay ball&sp45% clay ball&sp12% mudball|95% clay ball&sp80% clay ball&sp65% clay ball&sp3% slimeball|100% clay ball&sp100% clay ball&sp80% clay ball&sp8% slimeball||Coarse Dirt|10% loose stone&sp5% flint&sp5% stick&sp3% raw copper|20% loose stone&sp10% flint&sp10% stick&sp3% raw iron|30% loose stone&sp15% flint&sp5% lapis lazuli&sp3% raw gold||Deepened Gravel|12% copper nugget&sp8% coal&sp6% loose deepened stone&sp5% lapis lazuli|12% loose deepened stone&sp12% iron nugget&sp8% gold nugget&sp4% amethyst shard|20% coal&sp15% lapis lazuli&sp8% amethyst shard&sp1% diamond||Deepened Sand|10% redstone dust&sp8% copper nugget&sp5% iron nugget&sp3% gold nugget|20% redstone dust&sp12% coal&sp12% iron nugget&sp8% gold nugget|40% redstone dust&sp30% coal&sp20% iron nugget&sp15% gold nugget||Dirt|5% wheat seeds&sp5% beetroot seeds&sp3% stick&sp3% loose stone|12% loose stone&sp10% wheat seeds&sp5% pumpkin seeds&sp5% melon seeds|24% loose stone&sp15% wheat seeds&sp5% carrot&sp5% potato||Grass Block|10% loose stone&sp5% stick&sp5% oak sapling&sp5% birch sapling|5% grass&sp5% spruce sapling&sp5% dark oak sapling&sp5% acacia sapling|10% grass&sp5% cherry sapling&sp5% jungle sapling&sp3% bamboo||Gravel|15% flint&sp12% copper nugget&sp10% loose stone&sp5% coal|30% flint&sp20% copper nugget&sp15% loose stone&sp12% iron nugget|50% flint&sp20% iron nugget&sp10% gold nugget&sp2% emerald||Hellish Sand|5% rotton flesh&sp5% gold nugget&sp5% brown mushroom&sp5% red mushroom|12% rotton flesh&sp10% gold nugget&sp8% gunpowder&sp8% crimson fungus|20% gunpowder&sp18% gold nugget&sp12% glowstone dust&sp8% crimson fungus||Mud|75% mudball&sp60% mudball&sp12% clay ball&sp5% stick|95% mudball&sp80% mudball&sp4% mangrove propagule&sp3% spider eye|100% mudball&sp95% mudball&sp10% mangrove propagule&sp8% slimeball||Mycelium|10% loose stone&sp5% stick&sp3% brown mushroom&sp3% red mushroom|16% loose stone&sp12% stick&sp6% brown mushroom&sp6% red mushroom|24% loose stone&sp10% bone meal&sp10% brown mushroom&sp10% red mushroom||Podzol|10% loose stone&sp5% stick&sp3% fern&sp3% spruce sapling|8% fern&sp5% spruce sapling&sp3% brown mushroom&sp3% red mushroom|8% spruce sapling&sp6% brown mushroom&sp6% red mushroom&sp3% bone meal||Red Sand|20% gold nugget&sp12% gold nugget&sp12% copper nugget&sp3% bone meal|35% gold nugget&sp24% gold nugget&sp18% copper nugget&sp5% bone meal|85% gold nugget&sp24% copper nugget&sp8% iron nugget&sp8% bonemeal||Rooted Dirt|12% loose stone&sp8% hanging roots&sp5% stick&sp3% glow lichen|12% hanging roots&sp10% small dripleaf&sp8% big dripleaf&sp3% moss block|16% hanging roots&sp12% azalea&sp8% flowering azalea&sp5% moss block||Sand|20% copper nugget&sp10% iron nugget&sp3% iron nugget&sp3% bone meal|35% copper nugget&sp15% iron nugget&sp5% iron nugget&sp5% bone meal|50% copper nugget&sp30% iron nugget&sp8% bonemeal&sp5% gold nugget||Sculk|100% experience&sp80% experience&sp50% experience&sp20% experience|12% amethyst shard&sp10% coal&sp3% bone&sp2% glow berries|1% echo shard||Soul Sand/Soil|20% quartz&sp10% quartz&sp2% bone|35% quartz&sp15% quartz&sp5% bone&sp2% ghast tear|85% quartz&sp5% ghast tear&sp3% blaze powder&sp1% netherite fragment||Temporal Sand|8% chorus fruit&sp6% obsidian shard&sp2% ender pearl|20% chorus fruit&sp12% obsidian shard&sp4% ender pearl&sp1% shulker shell|36% chorus fruit&sp20% obsidian shard&sp8% ender pearl&sp1% bedrock shardtable>>

When manually sieving, the effects Luck and Bad Luck will impact the chance a drop will be given. If the player sieving has both Luck and Bad Luck, Luck will be applied first, followed by Bad Luck. For every level of Luck the player has, the chance for a drop will increase to codeoriginal chance * (level of Luck + 2)<<note(content=The level of status effects internally starts at 0, so +2 accounts for this offset. An effect at level 1 would read as 0, so Luck I = 0, II = 1, and so on.(text=noteCountnote>> (ex. a drop with a 10% chance will increase to 20% with Luck I, 30% with Luck II, and so on). For every level of Bad Luck the player has, the chance for a drop will decrease to codeoriginal chance / (level of Bad Luck + 2) (ex. a drop with a 10% chance will decrease to 5% with Bad Luck I, ~3% with Bad Luck II, and so on).
