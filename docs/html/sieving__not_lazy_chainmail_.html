      <h1>Sieving ({{iNot Lazy Chainmail}})</h1>
      <div><<shortProcess of reducing block in {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}}short>><<img(src=git/sieving updated again nlc.png(cap=The results in {{i[[JEI|Just Enought Items]]}} for sieving [[soul sand|soul sand (Minecraft)]].img>>{{bSieving}} is a process to turn [[blocks|block (Minecraft)]] into more valuable [[items|item (Minecraft)]] in the {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[mod|mod (Minecraft)]] {{i[[Not Lazy Chainmail]]}}. There are three tiers of sieving, using the [[iron|iron sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], [[rose gold|rose gold sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and [[iron composite|iron composite sieve mesh (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] [[sieve meshes|sieve meshes (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] respectively. Holding a sievable block with a sieve mesh in the offhand will destroy the block and give it a chance to return items based on the tier of the mesh. Not every tier is a direct improvement from the one prior, as certain items are only available at certain tiers. There are a maximum of four unique items that can be dropped from sieving. The following is a table of all the products that can be obtained from sieving:<<table{{bBlock}}|{{bIron}}|{{bRose Gold}}|{{bIron Composite}}||[[Clay|Clay (Minecraft)]]|75% [[clay ball|clay ball

If the player sieving has both Luck and Bad Luck, Luck will be applied first, followed by Bad Luck. For every level of Luck the player has, the chance for a drop will increase to {{codeoriginal chance * (level of Luck + 2)}}<<note(content=The level of status effects internally starts at 0, so +2 accounts for this offset. An effect at level 1 would read as 0, so Luck I = 0, II = 1, and so on.(text=noteCountnote>> (ex. a drop with a 10% chance will increase to 20% with Luck I, 30% with Luck II, and so on). For every level of Bad Luck the player has, the chance for a drop will decrease to {{codeoriginal chance / (level of Bad Luck + 2)}} (ex. a drop with a 10% chance will decrease to 5% with Bad Luck I, ~3% with Bad Luck II, and so on).<<hrSee alsohr>>;;[[Sieve dropper|Sieve dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Automated sieve|Automated sieve (Not Lazy Chainmail)]];;</div>
