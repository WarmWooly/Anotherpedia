Do you remember when we moved out?<br>My mum said, "I love you, but it's a small house"<br>So we changed up and saved up<br>Gave up our town<br>We were dangerous, couldn't tame us<br>What's missing now?<br><br>Time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>Suddenly, we got no time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>We're so busy doing life (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>That I miss your eyes on mine, mine<br><br>If you would just focus on me<br>Like we were sixteen<br>And planning our lives<br>Can I wear your t-shirt<br>And sleep on you<br>While I dream of all the good times?<br>When we were sixteen<br><br>Like we were sixteen<br>Like we were sixteen (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br><br>Do you remember the teacher said<br>"You're too young, too stupid, don't lose your head"<br>But years gone and we held on with the best intent<br>Just two kids who kicked it on MSN<br><br>Oh, time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>Suddenly, we got no time (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>We're so busy doing life (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>That I miss your eyes on mine, mine<br><br>Oh, if you would just focus on me<br>Like we were sixteen<br>And plotting our lives (when we were plotting our lives)<br>Can I wear your t-shirt<br>And sleep on you<br>While I dream of all the good times?<br>When we were sixteen<br><br>Like we were sixteen<br>Like we were sixteen<br><br>Let's take the love that we found<br>And give it back to ourselves<br>Sometimes these things don't work out<br>Sometimes there'll be no one else<br>They said we'd never even make it this far<br>But here we are<br>And we're still counting stars<br>Like we were sixteen<br><br>Oh, when we were sixteen<br>We're still counting stars like we were sixteen<br>And we're still counting stars like we were sixteen</div>
