      <h1>Skibidi</h1>
      <div>For the song, see SKIBIDI (song).<br>Skibidi is a slang adjective from 2023 that originated from the machinima series Skibidi Toilet that is used ironically, playing off of "Gen Alpha slang" (such as fanum tax and rizz). Skibidi has no set definition, more or less being thrown into sentences in which to show a level of immaturity to the speaker. An example of "skibidi" would be a person with "skibidi rizz." Skibidi has been used with and without capitalization interchangeably.</div>
