  <h1>Skibidi</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the song, see SKIBIDI (song).}}&sp{{bSkibidi}} is a slang adjective from 2023 that originated from the machinima web series {{iSkibidi Toilet}} that is used irony, playing off of "Gen Alpha slang" (such as fanum tax and rizz). Skibidi has no set definition, more or less being thrown into sentence in which to show a level of immaturity to the speaker. An example of "skibidi" would be a person with "skibidi rizz." Skibidi has been used with and without capitalization interchangeably.</div>
