Skybases are a staple of sandbox survival games or battle royales, such as Minecraft, Terraria, and Fortnite, where having a vantage point or elevated position is advantageous for survival. Skybases have many uses, such as being a form of protection against enemies or other players, having an open area to construct an expansive structure, or simply being decorative and unique.</div>
