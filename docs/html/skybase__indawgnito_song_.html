  <h1>Skybase (indawgnito song)</h1>
  <div>"{{bSkybase}}" is a {{iMinecraft}} parody of Keane "Somewhere Only We Know" created by indawgnito on April 11, 2025. "Skybase" tells a story of a {{iMinecraft}} player (Minecraft) who keeps getting griefing (Minecraft), so they resort to constructing a skybase to protect themselves.
I built a base out in the plains&spMade a potato farm and grew sugar cane&spI tamed a wolf and watched him grow&spJust he and I lived there, so happy alone&spBut then, one day, a griefer came&spHe lit my house on fire, my dog went up in flames&spI had to run; he took my diamond gear&spGuess I'll start over somewhere far away from here&pI sailed across the open sea&spExplored the caverns and the endless ravines&spDown in the caves, I built my home&spAnd there I hid away encased in stone&spThought I was safe, but think again&spSomebody griefed my base while I was in the End&spAnd I returned to nothing left behind&spI've gotta build a base no one can ever find&pI'll climb up to the clouds and build a skybase&spNobody is ever finding my base&spA palace in the sky where I'm the king&spThe only way I'm safe is if I'm in my skybase&spUp here in my skybase&pBut I'm a fool, I didn't know&spCreepers can spawn up here when light levels are low&spI felt a blast; fell through the floor&spGuess I won't be living in my skybase anymore&spThat's okay, I'll build another skybase&spThis time I'll put lights all over my base&spI'll never have to leave my home again&spFinally, I'm safe, up here in my skybase&spUp here in my skybase&spUp here in my skybase</div>
