      <h1>Skybase (indawgnito song)</h1>
      <div>"Skybase" is a Minecraft parody of Keane's "Somewhere Only We Know" created by indawgnito on April 11, 2025. "Skybase" tells a story of a Minecraft player who keeps getting griefed, so they resort to constructing a skybase to protect themselves.

I built a base out in the plains<br>Made a potato farm and grew sugar cane<br>I tamed a wolf and watched him grow<br>Just he and I lived there, so happy alone<br>But then, one day, a griefer came<br>He lit my house on fire, my dog went up in flames<br>I had to run; he took my diamond gear<br>Guess I'll start over somewhere far away from here<br><br>I sailed across the open sea<br>Explored the caverns and the endless ravines<br>Down in the caves, I built my home<br>And there I hid away encased in stone<br>Thought I was safe, but think again<br>Somebody griefed my base while I was in the End<br>And I returned to nothing left behind<br>I've gotta build a base no one can ever find<br><br>I'll climb up to the clouds and build a skybase<br>Nobody is ever finding my base<br>A palace in the sky where I'm the king<br>The only way I'm safe is if I'm in my skybase<br>Up here in my skybase<br><br>But I'm a fool, I didn't know<br>Creepers can spawn up here when light levels are low<br>I felt a blast; fell through the floor<br>Guess I won't be living in my skybase anymore<br>That's okay, I'll build another skybase<br>This time I'll put lights all over my base<br>I'll never have to leave my home again<br>Finally, I'm safe, up here in my skybase<br>Up here in my skybase<br>Up here in my skybase</div>
