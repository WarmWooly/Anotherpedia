  <h1>Slag ({{iMindustry}})</h1>
  <div><<shortHot liquid in {{iMindustry}}short>><<img(src=git/slag mindustry.png(cap=Slag.img>>{{bSlagr}} is a [[liquid|liquid (Mindustry)]] in {{i[[Mindustry]]}} on [[Serpulo|Serpulo (Mindustry)]] and [[Erekir|Erekir (Mindustry)]] and can be obtained through various means. On Serpulo, Slag can be collected by melting [[Scrap|Scrap (Mindustry)]] in a [[Melter|Melter (Mindustry)]]. On Erekir, Slag can be collected through pools of slag tiles on the surface using a [[Reinforced Pump|Reinforced Pump (Mindustry)]]. The description of Slag is the following:<<quoRefined in separators into constituent metals.&spConsumed in liquid turrets as ammunition.quo>>It has an [[Exposiveness|explosiveness (Mindustry)]] of 0%, a [[Flammability|flammability (Mindustry)]] of 0%, a [[Heat Capacity|heat capacity (Mindustry)]] of 50%, a [[Viscosity|viscosity (Mindustry)]] of 70%, and a [[Temperature|temperature (Mindustry)]] of 100%. On Serpulo, Slag can be used to create [[Copper|Copper (Mindustry)]], [[Lead|Lead (Mindustry)]], [[Graphite|Graphite (Mindustry)]], [[Titanium|Titanium (Mindustry)]], [[Sand|Sand (Mindustry)]], and [[Thorium|Thorium (Mindustry)]], and can be used as a liquid [[ammo|ammo (Mindustry)]]. On Erekir, Slag can be used to create [[Surge Alloy|Surge Alloy (Mindustry)]], to generate [[heat|heat (Mindustry)]] in a [[Slag Heater|Slag Heater (Mindustry)]], to generate [[power|power (Mindustry)]] in a [[Pyrolysis Generator|Pyrolysis Generator (Mindustry)]], and to destroy [[items|item (Mindustry)]] in a [[Slag Incinerator|Slag Incinerator (Mindustry)]]. When touched, either from entering a pool or being shot, it will give the [[unit|unit (Mindustry)]] the [[Melting|Melting (Mindustry)]] effect.</div>
