      <h1>Slide (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A slide is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by pressing codeF while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while grounded. When trying to perform a slide in the air, a dive (Laser Fight) will be done instead. Sliding is pivotal for quickly navigating the battlefield and getting through small gaps, giving a large speed boost in a single direction. A slide can be interrupted by jump (Laser Fight) or by allowing the slide to naturally decay. Holding sprint (Laser Fight) (codeShift) will increase the duration of the slide. Sliding will slow down over time, ending when the slide is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A slide awards 1 experience (Laser Fight). A slide costs 10 stamina (Laser Fight) to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an Ice Ray (Laser Fight) increases the slide speed multiplier from 3 to 4 and decreases the slide momentum decay from 20% to 10%.

Main page: Combo ({{aiLaser Fight)}}

When a slide is done back-to-back, they will be combined together. After 10 slides, a new slide chain will be started. The following is all the back-to-back combinations for sliding:<<tableCombo|Exp||Bislide|r1||Trislide|r1||Quadslide|r1||Quintslide|r2||Sexslide|r2||Septslide|r2||Octslide|r3||Nonslide|r3||Decslide|r4table>>

Main page: Roll ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>After landing a fall break (Laser Fight), sliding afterwards will perform a roll (Laser Fight) instead, being a faster, yet shorter burst of speed. Rolling awards 1 experience (Laser Fight). If the fall break is after a dive (Laser Fight) (a belly flop (Laser Fight)), sliding afterwards will perform a belly roll (Laser Fight), which gives 2 exp.

Main page: Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight)}}<br>If the player slides at a high enough speed into a ramp, they can be launched far into the air. While this is often dangerous, leading to the possibility of taking fall damage (Laser Fight), it looks pretty sick. If the player manages to launch themselves 100 studs in the air from their slide starting position, a lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight) will be preformed, awarding 12 exp and the badge (Roblox) Lethal Ollie (Laser Fight badge).

When chaining a slide into a dive into a second slide into a second dive (slide --> dive --> slide --> dive), a speed demon (Laser Fight) will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Sliding after a wall climb (Laser Fight) will perform a wall slide (Laser Fight), awarding 3 exp. When chaining a vault (Laser Fight) into a slide into a dive (vault --> slide --> dive), A Hop, Skip, And A Jump (Laser Fight) will be preformed, awarding 5 exp.</div>
