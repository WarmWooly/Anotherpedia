  <h1>Slide ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortGround-based movement action in {{iLaser Fightshort>><<img(src=git/slide laser fight.png(cap=A player sliding.img>>A {{bslide}} is a [[movement action|movement (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} triggered by pressing {{codeF}} while moving at or above 20 studs/sec while grounded. When trying to perform a slide in the air, a [[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]] will be done instead. Sliding is pivotal for quickly navigating the battlefield and getting through small gaps, giving a large speed boost in a single direction. A slide can be interrupted by [[jumping|jump (Laser Fight)]] or by allowing the slide to naturally decay. Holding [[sprint|sprint (Laser Fight)]] ({{codeShift}}) will increase the duration of the slide. Sliding will slow down over time, ending when the slide is less than the player's walkspeed + 1. A slide awards 1 [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]]. A slide costs 10 [[stamina|stamina (Laser Fight)]] to use and can't be performed when the player has less than 12 stamina. Holding an [[Ice Ray|Ice Ray (Laser Fight)]] increases the slide speed multiplier from 3 to 4 and decreases the slide momentum decay from 20% to 10%.<<hrComboshr>>{{tMain page: [[Combo ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}<<hr2Chaining slideshr2>>When a slide is done back-to-back, they will be combined together. After 10 slides, a new slide chain will be started. The following is all the back-to-back combinations for sliding:<<table{{bCombo}}|{{bExp}}||Bislide|{{r1}}||Trislide|{{r1}}||Quadslide|{{r1}}||Quintslide|{{r2}}||Sexslide|{{r2}}||Septslide|{{r2}}||Octslide|{{r3}}||Nonslide|{{r3}}||Decslide|{{r4}}table>><<hr2Rollinghr2>>{{tMain page: [[Roll ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spAfter landing a [[fall break|fall break (Laser Fight)]], sliding afterwards will perform a [[roll|roll (Laser Fight)]] instead, being a faster, yet shorter burst of speed. Rolling awards 1 [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]]. If the fall break is after a [[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]] (a [[belly flop|belly flop (Laser Fight)]]), sliding afterwards will perform a [[belly roll|belly roll (Laser Fight)]], which gives 2 exp.<<hr2Lethal nolliehr2>>{{tMain page: [[Lethal ollie/nollie ({{aiLaser Fight}})]]}}&spIf the player slides at a high enough speed into a ramp, they can be launched far into the air. While this is often dangerous, leading to the possibility of taking [[fall damage|fall damage (Laser Fight)]], it looks pretty sick. If the player manages to launch themselves 100 studs in the air from their slide starting position, a [[lethal nollie|lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight)]] will be preformed, awarding 12 exp and the [[badge|badge (Roblox)]] [[Lethal Ollie|Lethal Ollie (Laser Fight badge)]].<<hr2Other comboshr2>>When chaining a slide into a dive into a second slide into a second dive (slide --> dive --> slide --> dive), a [[speed demon|speed demon (Laser Fight)]] will be preformed, awarding 5 exp. Sliding after a [[wall climb|wall climb (Laser Fight)]] will perform a [[wall slide|wall slide (Laser Fight)]], awarding 3 exp. When chaining a [[vault|vault (Laser Fight)]] into a slide into a dive (vault --> slide --> dive), [[a hop, skip, and a jump|A Hop, Skip, And A Jump (Laser Fight)]] will be preformed, awarding 5 exp.</div>
