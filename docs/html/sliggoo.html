It has a lower, darker portion with a pair of small arms and an upper, lighter purple section with a hear and a small [[shell]]. All of Sliggoo's vital organs reside in the shell. It has two lighter green spots on each side of its mouth. It has a pair of antenna-like horns, short in the front, long in the back.&pSliggoo's official size is 2 [[ft|foot (unit)]], 7 [[in|inch]], while weighing 38.6 [[lbs|Pound]]. [[Shiny|Shiny (Pokémon)]] Sliggoos have a yellow top, an orange bottom, and purple spots instead of light/dark purple and green respectively, alongside purple eyes.&pIt is unclear what Sliggoo's name is a [[portmanteau]] of, ending with {{igoo}} and possibly starting with {{islippery}}, {{islimy}}, {{islug}}, or even a combination of these words.<<hrBehaviorhr>><<img(src=git/sliggoo dodge.gif(cap=Sliggoo [[dodging]] an [[attack]] from a [[Grumpig|Grumpig (Pokémon)]], [[sticking]] itself onto the ceiling of the [[cave]].img>>Sliggoo does not have any teeth, so it excretes an [[acidic|acid]] [[sticky]] [[mucus]] that can [[dissolve]] anything, spraying it onto prays to melt them before eating them. Despite having eyes, they have devolved, making Sliggoo blind. This means that Sliggoo will occasionally melt friend instead of foe. Its horns can detect [[sounds|sound]] and [[smells|smell]]. Sliggoo will flee from [[battle]] when it is not looking for [[food]].<<hrGame mechanicshr>>A Sliggoo has a 50/50 chance to be [[male]] or [[female]]. Sliggoo is the 705th Pokémon in the [[Pokédex|Pokédex (Pokémon)]] and has the Pokédex color purple.&pSliggoo [[evolves|evolution (pokémon)]] from [[Goomy|Goomy (Pokémon)]], which can then evolve at level 50 during [[rain]] or [[fog]] into [[Goodra|Goodra (pokémon)]]. When in [[Hisuian|Hisui (Pokémon)]] form, it will evolve into a Hisuian Goodra. Sliggoo's leveling rate is "Slow".<<hrHisuian formhr>><<img(src=git/hisuian sliggoo.png(cap=The Hisuain form of Sliggoo.img>>Hisuian Sliggoo is both Dragon type and [[Steel type|steel type (pokémon)]]. Sliggoo has teal-colored droopy eyes and spots, alongside a large metal shell. It only has one spot on each cheek, instead of two. Its shiny form has gold eyes and spots, alongside a bronze shell, with the rest of the coloring unchanged. This variation leaves its shell lying on the ground, unless it needs to flee, where it will prop the shell up and roll away. Hisuian Sliggoo's official size is 2 [[ft|foot (unit)]], 4 [[in|inch]], while weighing 151 [[lbs|Pound]].</div>
