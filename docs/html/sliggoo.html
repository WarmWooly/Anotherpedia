      <h1>Sliggoo</h1>
      <div>Sliggoo is a snail-like dragon type (pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation VI (Pokémon).

Sliggoo resembles a snail with a pair of large green eyes. It has a lower, darker portion with a pair of small arms and an upper, lighter purple section with a hear and a small shell. All of Sliggoo's vital organs reside in the shell. It has two lighter green spots on each side of its mouth. It has a pair of antenna-like horns, short in the front, long in the back.<br><br>Sliggoo's official size is 2 foot (unit), 7 inch, while weighing 38.6 Pound. Shiny (Pokémon) Sliggoos have a yellow top, an orange bottom, and purple spots instead of light/dark purple and green respectively, alongside purple eyes.<br><br>It is unclear what Sliggoo's name is a portmanteau of, ending with goo and possibly starting with slippery, slimy, slug, or even a combination of these words.

Sliggoo does not have any teeth, so it excretes an acid sticky mucus that can dissolve anything, spraying it onto prays to melt them before eating them. Despite having eyes, they have devolved, making Sliggoo blind. This means that Sliggoo will occasionally melt friend instead of foe. Its horns can detect sound and smell. Sliggoo will flee from battle when it is not looking for food.

A Sliggoo has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Sliggoo is the 705th Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color purple.<br><br>Sliggoo evolution (pokémon) from Goomy (Pokémon), which can then evolve at level 50 during rain or fog into Goodra (pokémon). When in Hisui (Pokémon) form, it will evolve into a Hisuian Goodra. Sliggoo's leveling rate is "Slow".

Hisuian Sliggoo is both Dragon type and steel type (pokémon). Sliggoo has teal-colored droopy eyes and spots, alongside a large metal shell. It only has one spot on each cheek, instead of two. Its shiny form has gold eyes and spots, alongside a bronze shell, with the rest of the coloring unchanged. This variation leaves its shell lying on the ground, unless it needs to flee, where it will prop the shell up and roll away. Hisuian Sliggoo's official size is 2 foot (unit), 4 inch, while weighing 151 Pound.</div>
