      <h1>SmartPass</h1>
      <div>SmartPass is a website and software used to create and manage hall passes in schools, primarily middle and high schools. These passes can be requested by students, where teachers or staff can accept or deny them. These passes can be given time limits to prevent extended periods with a student outside of class. They can also prevent certain students from being in the same place at the same time.</div>
