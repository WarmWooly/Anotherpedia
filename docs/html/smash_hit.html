The game can be downloaded and played for free, but the [[premium]] version can also be purchased for $1.99 US to unlock extra [[gamemodes|gamemode]] and [[reloading|reload]] from [[checkpoints|checkpoint]].<<hrGameplayhr>><<img(src=git/smash hit gameplay.png(cap=A [[screenshot]] of gameplay.(leftImgimg>>The gameplay involves the [[player]] constantly moving through an otherworldly dimension, shattering [[glass]] objects by throwing [[metal]] [[balls|ball]] at the objects in their way while maintaining a supply of balls. If the player runs into an object, they will lose 10 balls, and lose if they run out of balls. [[Blue]] glowing [[shapes|shape]] can be broken for more balls, with [[crystals]], [[diamonds]], and [[stars]] giving 3, 5, and 10 balls respectively. If the player smashes 10 blue shapes in a row, they achieve a streak and can throw 2 balls at once for the price of 1. This continues with streaks of 20, 30, and 40, being capped at 5 balls at once. If the player runs into an object or misses a blue shape, they will break their streak.&pThere are 13 levels in the game, called "checkpoints", which are points at which the player can [[restart]] from (if they've purchased premium), with the 1st one being called "Start", acting as a [[tutorial]]. The last checkpoint is an [[endless mode]], where the player can continue throughout an [[endless]] [[stage]] until they run out of balls.<<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AVmX5_PCbA(cap=The [[soundtrack]] for the [[game]].yt>>&pThere are 3 power-ups that can be obtained to assist the player for a short time:;;Frenzy Mode (green): The player can constantly throw a stream of [[infinite]] balls.
