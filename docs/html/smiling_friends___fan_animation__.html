      <h1>SMILING FRIENDS ( fan animation )</h1>
      <div>"SMILING FRIENDS ( fan animation )" is an animation based on Smiling Friends on YouTube made by Rhiane Turtonator on December 2, 2025. The animation depicts a Frowning Friends Inc. (Smiling Friends) across from Smiling Friends Inc. (Smiling Friends), where a critter (Smiling Friends) publicly displays a drug that makes people smile. It includes Rhiane Turtonator's original character Eric (Rhiane Turtonator) (cloaked figure), Pins (Rhiane Turtonator) (green critter), and Needles (Rhiane Turtonator) (red critter). The animation is over the song "Pirelli's Miracle Elixir". The video is 1 minute and 50 second in length.

After the Smiling Friends intro theme, a cloaked figure is seen. Tall green and red critters stand to his sides. He sings out to the crowd, with the employee of Smiling Friends Inc. briefly seen. The figure forces his face into a frown before gesture towards the crowd. After the figure and Mr. Boss (Smiling Friends) locks eyes, and it zooms in on Mr. Boss' worried face. It then shows the reaction of Pim (Smiling Friends), Charlie (Smiling Friends), Allan (Smiling Friends), and Glep (Smiling Friends). The figure is shown in front of a starry background as green and red silhouette resolve. A member of the crowd, shocked, points at the critters, who are shown to also be holding a frown. Crowd members laugh as Pim nervously scans. The green and red critters are shown singing within frames about their woe, before they are given a pill by the figure. After they take it, their eyes light up and their faces grin as the crowd gasp. In shock, Mr. Boss pushes Allan and Charlie aside while stepping forth. The figure removes their hood, showing their bleeding grin. The video ends with the internet meme Among Us potion from Arcade Craniacs.</div>
