      <h1>Smooth Sandstone Flushwork (Knapped)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|6||Hardness|2||Luminous|No||Transparent|No||Flammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Smooth sandstone flushwork are a set of smooth sandstone-based blocks in the Minecraft mod Knapped that can be interchanged between each other in a Stonecutter. The only smooth sandstone flushwork not included within this set is for the Thing, which requires an enchanted golden apple. The set includes the Bar, Body, Checkerboard, Cross, Crowd, Diamonds, Flower, Fortress, Panel, Point, Quarters, and Ring.



The only craftable flushwork is the Panel, using 1 smooth sandstone and 2 knapped flint bricks (item) (shapeless).



All types of smooth sandstone flushwork (besides Thing) can be cut in a Stonecutter to make the other types of flushwork.</div>
