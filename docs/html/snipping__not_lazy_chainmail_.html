      <h1>Snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div>Snipping is a process to turn coils (Not Lazy Chainmail) into chain links (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail. There are six different materials of coils that can be processed into chain links. The following is a table of the different results for different coils:<<tableCoil|{{bChain link||Iron Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail x64||Gold Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Gold Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail x64||Copper Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Copper Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail x64||Netherite Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Netherite Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail x64||Rose Gold Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Rose Gold Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail x64||Iron Composite Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)|Iron Composite Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail x64table>><br>The primary way to snip is to hold a coil in the main hand (Minecraft) and a pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) in the offhand (Minecraft) and right click. Each coil has a total of 64 chains that can be snipped. Better pliers will decrease the number of clicks required to fully snip a coil into a stack of chain links. The iron pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) snips 1 chain at a time, the rose gold pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) snips 2 chains at a time, and the iron composite pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail) snips 4 chains at a time.<br><br>unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be created when a chainmail project (Not Lazy Chainmail) is reset while in the middle of a project. Unfinished projects can be snipped the same as coils and will contain the type and number of chain links as used in the project.<br><br>The auto snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail) is a block (Minecraft) that can be used to automatically snip coils into chain links using a pair of pliers and an industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail). The rate of the snipping is based on the belt in the auto snipper.</div>
