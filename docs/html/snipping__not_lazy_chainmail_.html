      <h1>Snipping (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div>Snipping is a process to turn coils into chain links in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. There are six different materials of coils that can be processed into chain links. The following is a table of the different results for different coils:<<tableCoil|{{bChain link||Iron Coil|Iron Chain Link x64||Gold Coil|Gold Chain Link x64||Copper Coil|Copper Chain Link x64||Netherite Coil|Netherite Chain Link x64||Rose Gold Coil|Rose Gold Chain Link x64||Iron Composite Coil|Iron Composite Chain Link x64table>>&spThe primary way to snip is to hold a coil in the main hand and a pair of pliers in the offhand and right click. Each coil has a total of 64 chains that can be snipped. Better pliers will decrease the number of clicks required to fully snip a coil into a stack of chain links. The iron pliers snips 1 chain at a time, the rose gold pliers snips 2 chains at a time, and the iron composite pliers snips 4 chains at a time.&pUnfinished projects can be created when a chainmail project is reset while in the middle of a project. Unfinished projects can be snipped the same as coils and will contain the type and number of chain links as used in the project.&pThe auto snipper is a block that can be used to automatically snip coils into chain links using a pair of pliers and an industrial belt. The rate of the snipping is based on the belt in the auto snipper.</div>
