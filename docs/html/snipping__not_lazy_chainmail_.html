  <h1>Snipping ({{iNot Lazy Chainmail}})</h1>
  <div><<shortChain link creation process in {{iNot Lazy Chainmail}}short>><<img(src=git/snipping nlc.png(cap=Some snipping recipe results in {{i[[JEI|Just Enought Items]]}}.img>>{{bSnipping}} is a process to turn [[coils|coils (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] into [[chain links|chain links (Minecraft)]] in the {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[mod|mod (Minecraft)]] {{i[[Not Lazy Chainmail]]}}. There are six different materials of coils that can be processed into chain links. The following is a table of the different results for different coils:<<table{{bCoil|{{bChain link}}||[[Iron Coil|Iron Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Iron Chain Link|Iron Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail]] x64||[[Gold Coil|Gold Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Gold Chain Link|Gold Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail]] x64||[[Copper Coil|Copper Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Copper Chain Link|Copper Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail]] x64||[[Netherite Coil|Netherite Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Netherite Chain Link|Netherite Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail]] x64||[[Rose Gold Coil|Rose Gold Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Rose Gold Chain Link|Rose Gold Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail]] x64||[[Iron Composite Coil|Iron Composite Coil (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|[[Iron Composite Chain Link|Iron Composite Chain Link (Not Lazy Chainmail]] x64table>>&spThe primary way to snip is to hold a coil in the [[main hand|main hand (Minecraft)]] and a [[pair of pliers|pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] in the [[offhand|offhand (Minecraft)]] and right click. Each coil has a total of 64 chains that can be snipped. Better pliers will decrease the number of clicks required to fully snip a coil into a stack of chain links. The [[iron pliers|iron pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] snips 1 chain at a time, the [[rose gold pliers|rose gold pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] snips 2 chains at a time, and the [[iron composite pliers|iron composite pliers (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] snips 4 chains at a time.&p[[Unfinished projects|unfinished projects (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be created when a [[chainmail project|chainmail project (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] is reset while in the middle of a project. Unfinished projects can be snipped the same as coils and will contain the type and number of chain links as used in the project.&pThe [[auto snipper|auto snipper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] is a [[block|block (Minecraft)]] that can be used to automatically snip coils into chain links using a pair of pliers and an [[industrial belt|industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]. The rate of the snipping is based on the belt in the auto snipper.</div>
