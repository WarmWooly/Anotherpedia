      <h1>Soccer Ball Fall (Happy Wheels)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Ball Fall ({{aiHappy Wheels).}}<br>A Soccer Ball Fall or Ball Fall is a level genre within Happy Wheels where the player attempts to reach the bottom of the level while falling through layers of soccer balls. The number of soccer balls increases as the player gets closer to the finish line placed on the bottom. The level is made into separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses. Each layer has a floor that is solid for the soccer balls, keeping them trapped, while being non-interactable by the player, allowing them to pass through.<br><br>Pogo Stick Man is the most used character used for Soccer Ball Falls as his pogo stick is great for falling through soccer balls. Rapidly pressing the left and right movement buttons can be used to shimmy through soccer balls. The vast majority of Soccer Ball Falls are relatively harmless, beaten by shimmying through each level while occasionally prodding gaps with the pogo stick. Other round objects, such as food items, are rarely used as replacements for soccer balls.</div>
