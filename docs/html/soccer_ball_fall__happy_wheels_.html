      <h1>Soccer Ball Fall (Happy Wheels)</h1>
      <div>Not to be confused with Ball Fall ({{aiHappy Wheels).}}&spA Soccer Ball Fall or Ball Fall is a level genre (Happy Wheels) within Happy Wheels where the player (Happy Wheels) attempts to reach the bottom of the level (Happy Wheels) while falling through layers of soccer ball (Happy Wheels). The number of soccer balls increases as the player gets closer to the finish line (Happy Wheels) placed on the bottom. The level is made into separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses. Each layer has a floor that is solid for the soccer balls, keeping them trapped, while being non-interactable by the player, allowing them to pass through.&pPogo Stick Man (Happy Wheels) is the most used characters (Happy Wheel) used for Soccer Ball Falls as his pogo stick is great for falling through soccer balls. Rapidly pressing the left and right movement buttons can be used to shimmy through soccer balls. The vast majority of Soccer Ball Falls are relatively harmless, beaten by shimmying through each level while occasionally prodding gaps with the pogo stick. Other round objects, such as food items (Happy Wheels), are rarely used as replacements for soccer balls.</div>
