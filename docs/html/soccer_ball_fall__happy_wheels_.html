The number of soccer balls increases as the player gets closer to the [[finish line|finish line (Happy Wheels)]] placed on the bottom. The level is made into separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses. Each layer has a floor that is solid for the soccer balls, keeping them trapped, while being non-interactable by the player, allowing them to pass through.&p[[Pogo Stick Man|Pogo Stick Man (Happy Wheels)]] is the most used [[character|characters (Happy Wheel)]] used for Soccer Ball Falls as his pogo stick is great for falling through soccer balls. Rapidly pressing the left and right movement buttons can be used to shimmy through soccer balls. The vast majority of Soccer Ball Falls are relatively harmless, beaten by shimmying through each level while occasionally prodding gaps with the pogo stick.
