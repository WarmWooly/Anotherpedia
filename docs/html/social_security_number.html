  <h1>Social Security number</h1>
  <div>A {{bSocial Security number}} is an Identification that consists of nine numeric characters in the format 000-00-0000. It is required in the United States to apply for Job, making bank transactions, filling out Tax, applying for a government assistance program, obtaining a driver's licence, Rent/purchasing House, applying for insurance, and other institutional purposes.
The first three numbers are the Area Number, based on the Zone Improvement Plan of the mailing address for the application. The next two numbers are the Group Number, which used to be based on a specific pattern. The last four numbers are the Serial Number, which is assigned from 0001-9999.
The modern method to assign numbers is pure Random. This greatly decreases the chance of identity theft because, compared to the old system, a single-digit change is less likely to be a correct SSN.</div>
