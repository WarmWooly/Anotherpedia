      <div>For the song, see Something (song).<br>Something is an indefinite pronoun containing some and thing. It is a term used as a filler word that disregards the specificity of the object and the amount of said object. When there is not something, there is nothing.

There is something in the room.<br><br>We had something to eat.<br><br>When will there be something interesting in this museum?</div>
