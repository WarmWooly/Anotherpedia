      <h1>Sort Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe (Minecraft)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|5||hardness (Minecraft)|2||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|No||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The sort dropper is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to sort item (Minecraft entity) on chain conveyors (Not Lazy Chainmail).



The sort dropper can be crafting (Minecraft) with any chain conveyor (Not Lazy Chainmail), a crude engine (Not Lazy Chainmail), and a dropper (Minecraft) (place the engine below the dropper and the conveyor above; makes 4). Crafting the sort dropper will award the advancement (Minecraft) Mechanized Gravity (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Sort droppers require a chain conveyor to be placed above them before they will detect items flowing over. They take items that flow above the sort dropper, determine if the item meets the set criteria, and then drop it below if the item is the one being sorted for. Right-clicking the sort dropper will open up its menu. Sort droppers have 9 slots that can each hold an item to be sorted. If the Filter Type is set to "Whitelist", it will drop items that match one of the items in the slots. If the Filter Type is set to "Blacklist", it will drop items that do not match any of the items in the slots. Particles can be disabled using the "Particles" button.<br><br>An example for sorting would be loot from a mob farm (Minecraft). If the sort dropper has gunpowder (Minecraft) inside and is set to "Whitelist", only gunpowder will drop through it and other loot (i.e. rotten flesh (Minecraft), bone (Minecraft)) would continue flowing along above it. If it was set to "Blacklist", only gunpowder would flow across and every other item would be dropped through.

Sort droppers are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Hopper Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) - 1 sort dropper, 3 block of gold chain (Not Lazy Chainmail), and 1 hopper (Minecraft) (place the dropper in the middle, hopper on top, and the chains on the other three sides).<br>Sieve Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail) - 1 sort dropper and 4 block of iron chains (Not Lazy Chainmail) (place the dropper in the middle, surround with chains).</div>
