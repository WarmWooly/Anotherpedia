They take items that flow above the sort dropper, determine if the item meets the set criteria, and then drop it below if the item is the one being sorted for. Right-clicking the sort dropper will open up its menu. Sort droppers have 9 slots that can each hold an item to be sorted. If the Filter Type is set to "Whitelist", it will drop items that match one of the items in the slots. If the Filter Type is set to "Blacklist", it will drop items that do not match any of the items in the slots. Particles can be disabled using the "Particles" button.&pAn example for sorting would be loot from a [[mob farm|mob farm (Minecraft)]]. If the sort dropper has [[gunpowder|gunpowder (Minecraft)]] inside and is set to "Whitelist", only gunpowder will drop through it and other loot (i.e. [[rotten flesh|rotten flesh (Minecraft)]], [[bones|bone (Minecraft)]]) would continue flowing along above it. If it was set to "Blacklist", only gunpowder would flow across and every other item would be dropped through.<<hr2Craftinghr2>>Sort droppers are used in the following crafting recipes:&sp[[Hopper Dropper|Hopper Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - 1 sort dropper, 3 [[blocks of gold chains|block of gold chain (Not Lazy Chainmail)]], and 1 [[hopper|hopper (Minecraft)]] (place the dropper in the middle, hopper on top, and the chains on the other three sides).&sp[[Sieve Dropper|Sieve Dropper (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] - 1 sort dropper and 4 [[blocks of iron chains|block of iron chains (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] (place the dropper in the middle, surround with chains).</div>
