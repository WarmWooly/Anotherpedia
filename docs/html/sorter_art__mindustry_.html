      <h1>Sorter art (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>Sorter art is the act of using sorters to draw on the minimap. When a sorter is placed, it's selected item is displayed as a solid color on the minimap, instead of the color of the team who placed it. Sorter art is most prevalent on servers, where they can be seen by anyone. Sorter art can also be used to grief, such as displaying distasteful imagery on the minimap, alongside using copious amounts of Copper and Lead.</div>
