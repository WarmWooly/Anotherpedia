      <h1>Spectral Cards (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>Spectral Cards are a type of Consumable in Balatro. There are a total of 18 Spectral Cards that can be obtained. Spectral Cards are much harder to obtain compared to Planet and Tarot Cards, and are much more powerful. They can add Seals, create and duplicate Enhanced playing cards, create and duplicate Legendary and Editioned Jokers, upgrade poker hands, change card Ranks and Suits, and award money. These cards often have a cost, however, such as reducing hand size, removing all money, and destroying cards or Jokers. Spectral Cards are most often bought from Spectral Packs, but the Voucher Omen Globe can allow the cards to appear in Arcana Packs. They can also be obtained through Tags and Jokers.<<tableName|Effect||Familiar|Destroys a random card in your hand and creates 3 random Enhanced face cards (King, Queen, or Jack).||Grim|Destroys a random card in your hand and creates 2 random Enhanced Aces.||Incantation|Destroys a random card in your hand and creates 4 random Enhanced numbered cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10).||Talisman|Adds a Gold Seal to a selected card.||Aura|Adds Foil, Holographic, or Polychrome to a selected card.||Wraith|Creates a Rare Joker and sets money to $0 (even if it is negative).
