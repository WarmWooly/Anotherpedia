  <h1>Spectral Cards (Balatro)</h1>
  <div>Spectral Cards are a type of Consumables (Balatro) in Balatro. There are a total of 18 Spectral Cards that can be obtained. Spectral Cards are much harder to obtain compared to Planet Cards (Balatro) and Tarot Cards (Balatro), and are much more powerful. They can add Seals (Balatro), create and duplicate Enhancements (Balatro) playing cards (Balatro), create and duplicate Joker rarity (Balatro) and Editions (Balatro) Jokers (Balatro), upgrade poker hand (Balatro), change card Rank (Balatro) and Suit (Balatro), and award money (Balatro). These cards often have a cost, however, such as reducing hand size (Balatro), removing all money, and destroying cards or Jokers. Spectral Cards are most often bought from Spectral packs (Balatro), but the Vouchers (Balatro) Omen Globe (Balatro) can allow the cards to appear in Arcane Packs (Balatro). They can also be obtained through Tags (Balatro) and Jokers (Balatro).<<tableName|Effect||Familiar (Balatro)|Destroys a random card in your hand (Balatro) and creates 3 random Enhanced face cards (King, Queen, or Jack).||Grim (Balatro)|Destroys a random card in your hand and creates 2 random Enhanced Aces.||Incantation (Balatro)|Destroys a random card in your hand and creates 4 random Enhanced numbered cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10).||Talisman (Balatro)|Adds a Gold Seal (Balatro) to a selected card.||Aura (Balatro)|Adds Foil (Balatro), Holographic (Balatro), or Polychrome to a selected card.||Wraith (Balatro)|Creates a Rare Joker and sets money to $0 (even if it is negative).
