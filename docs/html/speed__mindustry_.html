      <h1>Speed (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>Speed in Mindustry is a measurement for the movement of unit (Mindustry) in tile (Mindustry)/second. The following are the speeds for units:<<tableUnit|Speed||Dagger (Mindustry)|r3.75 tiles/sec||Mace (Mindustry)|r3.75 tiles/sec||Fortress (Mindustry)|r3.22 tiles/sec||Scepter (Mindustry)|r2.70 tiles/sec||Reign (Mindustry)|r3.00 tiles/sec||Nova (Mindustry)|r4.12 tiles/sec||Pulsar (Mindustry)|r5.25 tiles/sec||Quasar (Mindustry)|r3.00 tiles/sec||Vela (Mindustry)|r3.30 tiles/sec||Corvus (Mindustry)|r2.25 tiles/sec||Crawler (Mindustry)|r7.50 tiles/sec||Atrax (Mindustry)|r4.50 tiles/sec||Spiroct (Mindustry)|r4.05 tiles/sec||Arkyid (Mindustry)|r4.65 tiles/sec||Toxopid (Mindustry)|r3.75 tiles/sec||Flare (Mindustry)|r20.25 tiles/sec||Horizon (Mindustry)|r12.37 tiles/sec||Zenith (Mindustry)|r12.75 tiles/sec||Antumbra (Mindustry)|r6.00 tiles/sec||Eclipse (Mindustry)|r4.05 tiles/sec||Mono (Mindustry)|r11.25 tiles/sec||Poly (Mindustry)|r19.50 tiles/sec||Mega (Mindustry)|r18.75 tiles/sec||Quad (Mindustry)|r9.00 tiles/sec||Oct (Mindustry)|r6.00 tiles/sec||Risso (Mindustry)|r8.25 tiles/sec||Minke (Mindustry)|r6.75 tiles/sec||Bryde (Mindustry)|r6.37 tiles/sec||Sei (Mindustry)|r5.47 tiles/sec||Omura (Mindustry)|r4.65 tiles/sec||Retusa (Mindustry)|r6.75 tiles/sec||Oxynoe (Mindustry)|r6.22 tiles/sec||Cyerce (Mindustry)|r6.45 tiles/sec||Aegires (Mindustry)|r5.25 tiles/sec||Navanax (Mindustry)|r4.87 tiles/sec||Alpha (Mindustry)|r22.50 tiles/sec||Beta (Mindustry)|r24.75 tiles/sec||Gamma (Mindustry)|r26.62 tiles/sec||Stell (Mindustry)|r5.62 tiles/sec||Locus (Mindustry)|r5.25 tiles/sec||Precept (Mindustry)|r4.80 tiles/sec||Vanquish (Mindustry)|r4.72 tiles/sec||Conquer (Mindustry)|r3.60 tiles/sec||Merui (Mindustry)|r5.40 tiles/sec||Cleroi (Mindustry)|r5.25 tiles/sec||Anthicus (Mindustry)|r4.87 tiles/sec||Tecta (Mindustry)|r4.50 tiles/sec||Collaris(Mindustry)|r8.25 tiles/sec||Elude (Mindustry)|r13.50 tiles/sec||Avert (Mindustry)|r15.00 tiles/sec||Obviate (Mindustry)|r13.50 tiles/sec||Quell (Mindustry)|r8.25 tiles/sec||Disrupt (Mindustry)|r7.50 tiles/sec||Evoke (Mindustry)|r42.00 tiles/sec||Incite (Mindustry)|r52.50 tiles/sec||Emenate (Mindustry)|r56.25 tiles/sectable>>

There are various status effect (Mindustry) that effects the speed of units. This speed impact is multiplied by a unit's speed (ex. a Scepter effected by Freezing will move at 1.62 tiles/sec instead of 2.70 tiles/sec). The following are status effects that impact speed:<<tableEffect|Speed Multiplier||Freezing (Mindustry)|r60%||Unmoving (Mindustry)|r0%||Wet (Mindustry)|r94%||Melting (Mindustry)|r80%||Sapped (Mindustry)|r70%||Electrified (Mindustry)|r70%||Spore Slowed (Mindustry)|r80%||Tarred (Mindustry)|r60%||Overdrive (Mindustry)|r115%||Ocerclock (Mindustry)|r115%table>></div>
