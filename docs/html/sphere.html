      <h1>Sphere</h1>
      <div>For the venue, see Sphere (venue).&spA sphere is a third dimension shape defined by being of equal distance, as set by the radius, away from a single point (mathematics), known as the center (geometry). It can be described as being a projection of a second dimension circle. The distance going from one side of the sphere to the other, crossing the center, is known as its diameter. The surface area of a sphere can be calculated by multiplying pi with 4 and the squared radius (SA = 4&mpirs-u2). The volume of a sphere can be calculated by multiplying pi by 4/3 and the cubed radius (V = 4/3&mpirs-u3).&pSpheres with a radius of 1 are known as unit sphere.</div>
