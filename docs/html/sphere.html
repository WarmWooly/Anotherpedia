The [[dotted line]] is used to show depth.(brightImgimg>>A {{bsphere}} is a [[3D|third dimension]] [[shape]] defined by being of [[equal]] [[distance]], as set by the [[radius]], away from a single [[point|point (mathematics)]], known as the [[center|center (geometry)]]. It can be described as being a projection of a [[2D|second dimension]] [[circle]]. The distance going from one side of the sphere to the other, crossing the center, is known as its [[diameter]]. The [[surface area]] of a sphere can be calculated by multiplying [[pi]] with 4 and the [[squared]] radius (SA = 4&mpir{{s-u2}}). The [[volume]] of a sphere can be calculated by multiplying pi by 4/3 and the [[cubed]] radius (V = 4/3&mpir{{s-u3}}).&pSpheres with a radius of 1 are known as [[unit spheres|unit sphere]].</div>
