      <h1>SpineNeck</h1>
      <div>SpineNeck was a massager made by SpineDeck. It was used to reduce tension in the neck by rocking the head back and forth across the aparatus. SpineDeck claimed that it could reduce neck pain, headaches, and bad posture in 10 minutes of use. It is no longer available for purchase <<asofJuly 2025>>.
The SpineNeck had a rating of 4.8/5 stars. Here are a few ratings:&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Paul Gibson, October 2022&spMan, am I happy this lil futuristic tsunami pillow exists (not it's real name, I give it nicknames cus it's just so cute and weird lookin!) I'll have to travel with it and have one in my life forever from here on out but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make...&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Vstar, October 2022&spWorks great!&spThis device was very comfortable to use. The natural stretch in your neck is felt right away. I tend to have stress in my neck and after using this device, I noticed less tension.&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Marty Mc., 2020&spI have the spinedeck and this is now also great. Perhaps not as great as the spinedeck, but still relaxing</div>
