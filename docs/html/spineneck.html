I'll have to travel with it and have one in my life forever from here on out but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make...&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Vstar, October 2022&sp{{bWorks great!}}&spThis device was very comfortable to use. The natural stretch in your neck is felt right away. I tend to have stress in my neck and after using this device, I noticed less tension.&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Marty Mc., 2020&spI have the spinedeck and this is now also great. Perhaps not as great as the spinedeck, but still relaxing</div>
