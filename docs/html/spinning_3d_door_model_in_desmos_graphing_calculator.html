  <h1>Spinning 3d door model in desmos graphing calculator</h1>
  <div>"{{bSpinning 3d door model in desmos graphing calculator}}" is a video on YouTube made by Budak Game (YouTuber) on March 12, 2025. The video, recorded with Kinemaster, shows a 3D modeling on Desmos of a door made on the graphing calculator website Desmos. The door is not made in Desmos 3D, but rather their traditional 2D counterpart, using equations to make lines and colored areas. The door spins right, then left, then right again. The song "E1 - Feeling ripping euphoria" by 1583637 (artist) from vCJD (fan project) plays in the background. The video's description reads:The unsettling music paired with the sporadic spinning of the door on an application often not used for 3D modeling makes the video offputting and strange. The simple title adds to this feeling, directly describing what the video contains in plain English.</div>
