      <h1>Spinning 3d door model in desmos graphing calculator</h1>
      <div>"Spinning 3d door model in desmos graphing calculator" is a video on YouTube made by Budak Game on March 12, 2025. The video, recorded with Kinemaster, shows a 3D model of a door made on the graphing calculator website Desmos. The door is not made in Desmos 3D, but rather their traditional 2D counterpart, using equations to make lines and colored areas. The door spins right, then left, then right again. The song "E1 - Feeling ripping euphoria" by 1583637 from vCJD plays in the background. The video's description reads:The unsettling music paired with the sporadic spinning of the door on an application often not used for 3D modeling makes the video offputting and strange. The simple title adds to this feeling, directly describing what the video contains in plain English.</div>
