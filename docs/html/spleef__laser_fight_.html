  <h1>Spleef (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>Spleef is a tiny indoor VIP map (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox Game) based on the Minecraft minigame Spleef. Players spawn on the top floor of the map on an unbreakable block. All the white blocks can be destroyed, falling and disappearing when shot at. There are a total of 8 layers, with the last one being 2 blocks thick. Players can't die from fall damage (Laser Fight) on the map, but ragdolling will often lead to an undesirable fate regardless. Gun (Laser Fight) will only gun spawning (Laser Fight) on the top floor.
The lava covering the bottom of the map is lethal, killing players on contact. The death screen will say, "Lava killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X burned alive|X tried to swim in lava|X hates lava|X was cooked to a crisp|X dove into a hot tub|X swam in stone|X overheated|X was turned into charcoal;;</div>
