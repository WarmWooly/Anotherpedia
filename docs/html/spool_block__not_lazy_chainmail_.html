The spool block can be crafted with 1 empty spool and 2 wooden slabs (spool in the center, slabs above and below).

A bright spool block can be smoked in a smoker to produce a spool block, taking 1 second.



Spool blocks are used in the following  crafting recipes:&spBright Spool Block x4 - 4 spool blocks and 1 glowstone dust (place the glowstone dust in the center and surround it with the spool blocks).&spChain Launcher - 1 spool block, 4 blocks of iron chains, 1 piston, 1 chain, and 1 lever (place the piston in the center, the chain to the right, the spool block to the left, the lever in the bottom left corner, and fill the top, bottom, and right corners with blocks of iron chains).&spConveyor Manager x4 - 4 spool blocks, 1 crude engine, and 4 rose gold ingots (place the engine in the middle, the spool blocks on the sides, and the rose gold in the corners).

Spool blocks can be crushed into 1 empty spool.

Spool blocks can be haunted into bright spool blocks.

In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 spool block can fuel for 20 seconds (2 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (64 spool blocks, 1280 seconds, 128 items).</div>
