      <h1>Sprint (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Sprint is a togglable movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by holding codeShift, doubling the player's speed. While sprinting, the player will slowly lose stamina (Laser Fight), stopping when codeShift is released or when the player runs out. Stamina will not regenerate while sprinting. When performing a slide (Laser Fight) or a dive (Laser Fight), sprinting during the action will extend the duration of the slide/dive. Sprinting while jump (Laser Fight) from a wall hang (Laser Fight) will cause a wall launch (Laser Fight) to be performed instead of a wall climb (Laser Fight). Sprinting while dropping a gun (Laser Fight) will cause it to be thrown instead.</div>
