  <h1>Sprint ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
  <div><<shortSpeed-increasing movement action in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/sprint laser fight.png(cap=A player sprinting.img>>{{bSprint}} is a togglable [[movement action|movement (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} triggered by holding {{codeShift}}, doubling the player's speed. While sprinting, the player will slowly lose [[stamina|stamina (Laser Fight)]], stopping when {{codeShift}} is released or when the player runs out. Stamina will not regenerate while sprinting. When performing a [[slide|slide (Laser Fight)]] or a [[dive|dive (Laser Fight)]], sprinting during the action will extend the duration of the slide/dive. Sprinting while [[jumping|jump (Laser Fight)]] from a [[wall hang|wall hang (Laser Fight)]] will cause a [[wall launch|wall launch (Laser Fight)]] to be performed instead of a [[wall climb|wall climb (Laser Fight)]]. Sprinting while dropping a [[gun|gun (Laser Fight)]] will cause it to be thrown instead.</div>
