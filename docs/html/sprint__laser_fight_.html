      <h1>Sprint (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Sprint is a togglable movement action in Laser Fight triggered by holding codeShift, doubling the player's speed. While sprinting, the player will slowly lose stamina, stopping when codeShift is released or when the player runs out. Stamina will not regenerate while sprinting. When performing a slide or a dive, sprinting during the action will extend the duration of the slide/dive. Sprinting while jumping from a wall hang will cause a wall launch to be performed instead of a wall climb. Sprinting while dropping a gun will cause it to be thrown instead.</div>
