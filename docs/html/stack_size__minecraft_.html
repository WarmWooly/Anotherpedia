      <h1>Stack size (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>Stack size is the limit to the number of items that can fit within a single slot in Minecraft, such as within the hotbar, inventory, and in containers like chests. Most items have a stack size of 64. Some items, such as eggs, snowballs, ender pearls, buckets, signs, and armor stands, can only be stacked up to 16. Items with durability (tools and armor, boats/minecarts, beds, potions, filled buckets, and other items only have a stack size of 1, which are called "unstackable." All items can have their stack size changed with commands up to 99 in Java and 127 in Bedrock.</div>
