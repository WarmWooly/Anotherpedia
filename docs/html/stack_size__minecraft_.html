  <h1>Stack size (Minecraft)</h1>
  <div>{{bStack size}} is the limit to the number of item (Minecraft) that can fit within a single slot in {{iMinecraft}}, such as within the hotbar (Minecraft), inventory (Minecraft), and in containers like chest (Minecraft). Most items have a stack size of 64. Some items, such as egg (Minecraft), snowball (Minecraft), ender pearl (Minecraft), bucket (Minecraft), sign (Minecraft), and armor stand (Minecraft), can only be stacked up to 16. Items with durability (Minecraft) (tool (Minecraft) and armor (Minecraft), boat (Minecraft)/minecart (Minecraft), bed (Minecraft), potion (Minecraft), filled buckets, and other items only have a stack size of 1, which are called "unstackable." All items can have their stack size changed with command (Minecraft) up to 99 in Minecraft: Java Edition and 127 in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.</div>
