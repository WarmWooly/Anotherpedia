  <h1>Stair Force One</h1>
  <div>{{bStair Force One}}, also known as {{bChair Force One}}, refers to Joe Biden Joe Biden falling up the stairs onto Air Force One, often depicting Joe Biden on a stairlift up the stairs. It has since become a internet meme popular in the United States, mocking the President of the United States for their old age. It was most likely sparked because of Biden's change to use the shorter stairs to get onto Air Force One alongside the now-iconic tripping on stairs that Biden had early into his presidency.</div>
