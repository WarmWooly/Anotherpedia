      <h1>Stair Force One</h1>
      <div>Stair Force One, also known as Chair Force One, refers to Joe Biden's difficulty climbing up the stairs onto Air Force One, often depicting Joe Biden on a stairlift up the stairs. It has since become a meme popular in the United States, mocking the president for their old age. It was most likely sparked because of Biden's change to use the shorter stairs to get onto Air Force One alongside the now-iconic trip that Biden had early into his presidency.</div>
