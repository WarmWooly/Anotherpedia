  <h1>Stakes (Balatro)</h1>
  <div>{{bStakes}} are modifiers to Decks (Balatro) in {{iBalatro}} used to increase the difficulty of run (Balatro) for the player. Each Stake adds to the previous Stake's effect. Stakes are also required for the full completion of {{iBalatro}}. To play a Stake on a Deck, all prior Stakes must be completed (to play on the Green Stake, the Red and White Stakes must have been completed first). Each Deck will track Stakes separately from one another. When completing a Deck on a Stake, it will be given a Stake Stickers (Balatro) based on the Stake completed. These Stickers will also be applied to Jokers (Balatro) if they were in the player's Joker slots in the final hand of the run. There are a total of 8 different Stakes.<<table{{bName}}|{{bEffect}}||White Stake (Balatro)|The base difficulty.||Red Stake (Balatro)|Small Blind (Balatro) do not award money.||Green Stake (Balatro)|Blinds (Balatro) scale faster (require more chips to win) with each Ante (Balatro).||Black Stake (Balatro)|Jokers (Balatro) have a 30% chance of having an Eternal Sticker (Balatro) (can't be sold or destroyed).||Blue Stake (Balatro)|-1 Discard (Balatro).||Purple Stake (Balatro)|Blinds scale even faster with each Ante.||Orange Stake (Balatro)|Jokers have a 30% chance of having a Perishable Sticker (Balatro) (debuff (Balatro) after five round (Balatro)).||Gold Stake (Balatro)|Jokers have a 30% chance of having a Rental Sticker (Balatro) (only costs $1, but takes $3 each round, even into debt).table>></div>
