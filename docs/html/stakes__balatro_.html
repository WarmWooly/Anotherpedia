  <h1>Stakes ({{iBalatro}})</h1>
  <div><<shortDifficulty-increasing Deck modifiers in {{iBalatro}}short>><<img(src=git/balatro stakes.png(cap=The Stakes.img>>{{bStakes}} are modifiers to [[Decks|Decks (Balatro)]] in {{i[[Balatro]]}} used to increase the difficulty of [[runs|run (Balatro)]] for the player. Each Stake adds to the previous Stake's effect. Stakes are also required for the full completion of {{iBalatro}}. To play a Stake on a Deck, all prior Stakes must be completed (to play on the Green Stake, the Red and White Stakes must have been completed first). Each Deck will track Stakes separately from one another. When completing a Deck on a Stake, it will be given a [[Stake Sticker|Stake Stickers (Balatro)]] based on the Stake completed. These Stickers will also be applied to [[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]] if they were in the player's Joker slots in the final hand of the run. There are a total of 8 different Stakes.<<table{{bName}}|{{bEffect}}||[[White Stake|White Stake (Balatro)]]|The base difficulty.||[[Red Stake|Red Stake (Balatro)]]|[[Small Blinds|Small Blind (Balatro)]] do not award money.||[[Green Stake|Green Stake (Balatro)]]|[[Blinds|Blinds (Balatro)]] scale faster (require more chips to win) with each [[Ante|Ante (Balatro)]].||[[Black Stake|Black Stake (Balatro)]]|[[Jokers|Jokers (Balatro)]] have a 30% chance of having an [[Eternal Sticker|Eternal Sticker (Balatro)]] (can't be sold or destroyed).||[[Blue Stake|Blue Stake (Balatro)]]|-1 [[Discard|Discard (Balatro)]].||[[Purple Stake|Purple Stake (Balatro)]]|Blinds scale even faster with each Ante.||[[Orange Stake|Orange Stake (Balatro)]]|Jokers have a 30% chance of having a [[Perishable Sticker|Perishable Sticker (Balatro)]] ([[debuffed|debuff (Balatro)]] after five [[rounds|round (Balatro)]]).||[[Gold Stake|Gold Stake (Balatro)]]|Jokers have a 30% chance of having a [[Rental Sticker|Rental Sticker (Balatro)]] (only costs $1, but takes $3 each round, even into debt).table>></div>
