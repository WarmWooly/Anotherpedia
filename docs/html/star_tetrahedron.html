      <h1>Star tetrahedron</h1>
      <div>For the non-pseudoscience shape, see stellated octahedron.<br>A star tetrahedron is a 3D shape comprised of two tetrahedrons, with one flipped upside down and put inside the other, which is also known as a stellated octahedron. It is commonly found throughout sacred geometry, being a pseudoscientific term used for marketing scams.

The star tetrahedron represents the human body (male and female), Earth and Sun (or heaven). The male star tetrahedron has the Sun tetrahedron (facing upwards) pointing forwards, and the Earth tetrahedron (facing downwards) flat. These are reversed for the female star tetrahedron. A human's Merkaba field is a spinning star tetrahedron, where our upper dimensions are shaped. It also gives us connection to our spiritual bodies from our physical ones.</div>
