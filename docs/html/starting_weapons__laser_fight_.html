      <h1>Starting Weapons (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Starting Weapons is a mode in Laser Fight where the player spawns in with three random guns. This is similar to the mode One Gun Run, where players spawn with 1 random gun instead of 3. Guns will not spawn and can't be dropped in this mode.</div>
