      <h1>States of matter</h1>
      <div>There are currently 5 accepted states of matter (from least energetic to most): Bose-Einstein condensate, solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. These represent the form taken by nearly all matter in the universe, which is useful for predicting how they interact with themselves and other objects.</div>
