      <h1>Statue (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>A statue in Minecraft is a build (Minecraft) that resembles a person, animal, or character. Statues may be of the player (Minecraft) skin (Minecraft) to directly depict the player within the world. The size of statues varies, from tiny models vaguely resembling a figure to massive megabuild (Minecraft) that tower over terrain (Minecraft). Statues can be incorporated as part of a greater build or be the main feature. Statues can also be used as base (Minecraft), leading to a unique interior structure based around the statue's form.</div>
