      <h1>Steam Discord scam</h1>
      <div>A Steam Discord scam is a phishing and confidence scam over Discord (application) where a user (the scammer) direct messaging a target saying that they have false report their Steam (service) account. They create a sense of urgency through claiming that the account could be ban/IP ban or that a law was broken. The first user then directs the target to a second account impersonation as an employee of Steam, usually based on a real account. They ask the target to send screenshot of their purchase history and/or send their email and a one-time password, which they can use to try and gain access to the account. Afterwards, the scammer will change the password, email, and/or phone number associated with the account to lock the target out. They may then use this to extortion the target to give over valuable Steam items, gift card, or cryptocurrency. They may also sell the account to another person based on the video game associated with the account.<br><br>Steam will never have a user contact their Steam Support through Steam's chat or Discord DMs. Steam ignores false reports and lists common scams for users to find. To reduce the chance of having a scammer contact a target, they can hide or remove their connection to Steam on Discord, thusly removing the public link between their Discord and Steam accounts.</div>
