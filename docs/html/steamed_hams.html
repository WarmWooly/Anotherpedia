      <div><<shortPopular meme related to {{iThe Simpsons}}short>><<img(src=git/steamed hams.png(cap=Skinner serving the burgers to Chalmers.img>>{{bSteamed Hams}} refers to {{i[[The Simpsons]]}} [[episode]] "[[22 Short Films About Springfield|22 Short Films About Springfield (The Simpsons)]]" segment "Skinner & The Superintendent" [[written|writing]] by [[Bill Oakley]] which turns [[Principal Skinner's|Seymour Skinner (The Simpsons)]] and [[Superintendent Chalmers'|Gary Chalmers (The Simpsons)]] awkward relationship into a [[sitcom]] where Skinner serves Chalmers [[lunch]], following the "[[Dinner with the Boss]]" [[trope]]. The episode aired on April 14th, 1996. It has since become ingrained into [[meme culture]] because of the [[humor]] behind it, turning into a [[meme]] across multiple [[communities|internet community]].<<hrSynopsishr>>Skinner invites Chalmers to his [[house]] for lunch. After [[burning|burnt (food)]] a roast he was preparing in his [[oven]], he sneaks out his window to a nearby [[Krusty Burger|Krusty Burger (The Simpsons)]] to purchase [[burgers|burger]] and [[fries|french fries]]. Returning from the [[kitchen]], he serves Chalmers the burgers, who recognizes the [[taste]]. Skinner fumbles through his [[explanation]] about the origin, with the kitchen catching [[fire]] in the meantime. After entering and leaving the kitchen (finding out that it's engulfed in flames), Skinner attempts to get Chalmers out of the house. Chalmers, however, catches a glimpse of the fire and questions it, with Skinner saying that it's an [[aurora borealis]]. Skinner then escorts Chalmers out of the house while his [[mother]] [[Agnes|Agnes Skinner (The Simpsons)]] screams about the worsening situation. As soon as Chalmers drives away (unaware of the fire), Skinner returns to the house to presumably fight the fire. The next shot fixates onto a [[fire truck]] before panning away to [[Homer Simpson|Homer Simpson (The Simpsons)]], [[transitioning|transition]] to the next [[scene]].<<hrTranscripthr>>{{bChalmers}}: Well, Seymour, I made it, despite your directions.&sp{{bSkinner}}: Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome. I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!&sp{{bChalmers}}: Yeah.&sp[{{iSkinner runs to the kitchen, only to find his roast is burnt and gasps in horror}}]&sp{{bSkinner}}: Oh, egads! My roast is ruined! But what if I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? [{{ichuckles}}] Delightfully devilish, Seymour.&sp[{{iHe begins to climb through the window, but Chalmers enters the kitchen. The theme song to an imaginary show called "Skinner and the Superintendent" then plays:}}]<<quo{{iSkinner with his crazy explanations,&spThe superintendent's gonna need his medication,&spWhen he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations,&spThere'll be trouble in town tonight!}}quo>>{{bChalmers}}: SEEEEEYMOOUUURRR!!!&sp{{bSkinner}}: Superintendent! I was just...uh---just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise! Care to join me?&sp{{bChalmers}}: Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?&sp{{bSkinner}}: Uh... ooh! That isn't smoke, it's steam! Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams!&sp[{{iOnce Chalmers leaves the kitchen, Skinner breathes a sigh of relief, climbs out the window, and runs across the street to Krusty Burger, where he buys hamburgers and french fries to replace his burnt roast. He enters the dining room with the fast food on a silver tray.}}]&sp{{bSkinner}}: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouthwatering hamburgers.&sp{{bChalmers}}: I thought we were having steamed clams.&sp{{bSkinner}}: Oh no, I said 'steamed hams'. That's what I call hamburgers.&sp{{bChalmers}}: You call hamburgers 'steamed hams'?&sp{{bSkinner}}: Yes! It's a regional dialect.&sp{{bChalmers}}: Uh-huh. Eh, what region?&sp{{bSkinner}}: Uh...upstate New York.&sp{{bChalmers}}: Really? Well I'm from Utica and I've never heard anyone use the phrase 'steamed hams'.&sp{{bSkinner}}: Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.&sp{{bChalmers}}: I see.&sp[{{iChalmers takes a bite out of a burger and chews it a little, while Skinner sips his drink.}}]&sp{{bChalmers}}: You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.&sp{{bSkinner}}: Hohoho, no! Patented Skinner Burgers. Old family recipe!&sp{{bChalmers}}: For steamed hams?&sp{{bSkinner}}: Yes.&sp{{bChalmers}}: Yes, and you call them steamed hams, despite the fact they are obviously grilled.&sp{{bSkinner}}: Y- Uh.. you know, the... One thing I should... excuse me for one second.&sp{{bChalmers}}: Of course.&sp[{{iSkinner enters and leaves the kitchen swiftly upon seeing it is now on fire}}]&sp{{bSkinner}}: [{{iyawns}}] Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped.&sp{{bChalmers}}: Yes, I should be--{{igood lord, what is happening in there?!}}&sp{{bSkinner}}: Aurora Borealis?&sp{{bChalmers}}: Ah- {{iAurora Borealis?!}} At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, {{ilocalized entirely within your kitchen?!}}&sp{{bSkinner}}: Yes.&sp{{bChalmers}}: ...May I see it?&sp{{bSkinner}}: ...No.&sp[{{iThey exit the house as the kitchen fire grows larger.}}]&sp{{bAgnes}}: Seymour! The house is on fire!&sp{{bSkinner}}: No, mother, it's just the Northern Lights.&sp{{bChalmers}}: Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say... you steam a good ham.&sp[{{iAs Chalmers begins heading home, Agnes screams for help, causing Chalmers to look back towards the house. Skinner gives him a thumbs up and a fake smile, causing him to keep walking away. Once Chalmers is out of sight, Skinner rushes back into the house to deal with the fire.}}]&sp{{bAgnes}}: Help! {{iHELP!!!}}<<hrOrigin and referencehr>><<img(src=git/cincinnati steamed hams.jpg(cap=A [[photo]] of a [[TV]] showing "The Road to Cincinnati".img>>Steamed Hams was written by Bill Oakley for "22 Short Films About Springfield", which he now views as his most [[famous]] work. The origin of the segment is tied closely with the origin of the episode, where the [[writers|writer]] wanted to add more scenes with [[background characters|background character]], dedicating an entire episode around the idea. The staff were assigned parts based on their [[favorite]] [[characters|character]], which for Oakley was Chalmers. This was following "[[Bart on the Road|Bart on the Road (The Simpsons)]]", where Skinner's awkward interaction with Chalmers has him end up sending all the [[students|student]] to an [[impromptu]] [[Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day]] (named "go to work with your parents day" in the episode). He wanted to stretch out how Skinner [[lies|lying]] to its [[limit]], coming up with the [[idea]] for "Skinner & The Superintendent".&pIn 2020, [[Season 32|The Simpsons (season 32)]], there is an episode "[[The Road to Cincinnati|The Road to Cincinnati (The Simpsons)]]" that stretched the fundamental idea behind "Skinner & The Superintendent" into a full episode about a [[road trip]] with Skinner and Chalmers after several [[mishaps|mishap]], where halarity ensues. There is a [[reference]] to Steamed Hams in the form of a passing [[restaurant]] during the road trip.<<hrAnimation errorshr>><<img(src=git/steamed hams bite.png(cap=The [[bun]] has a bite mark, but not the burger.img>>There are several [[animation errors|animation error]] that occurred during the segment, which have been sought out and noted. The most well-known is when Chalmers takes a visible [[bite]] into the burger, to then show it to Skinners with the [[patty]] untouched. Some relate to [[discoloration]] or [[perspective]] issues, while others relate to [[continuity errors|continuity error]]. When Chalmers opens the [[door]] to the kitchen, it is magically closed in the next shot. There are a plethora of small marks and lines that are left on [[frames|frame (animation)]]. When Skinner sets out four burgers, and they each take one burger, there is only one burger left (phantom burger).<<hrMemehr>>Steams Hams has since become a [[meme]], garnering [[videos|video]], [[games|video game]], [[songs|song]], [[tattoos|tattoo]], [[art]], and other [[media]] related to Steamed Hams.<<hr2Steamed Hams but...hr2>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EWUY-MJt9A(cap=Steamed Hams but it's a [[telltale]] game.yt>>Steamed Hams but... refers to videos on [[YouTube]] that spin the formula or content of Steamed Hams in a different direction. These are often [[humorous|humor]] in nature and many are well-made. </div>
