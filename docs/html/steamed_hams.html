  <h1>Steamed Hams</h1>
  <div>Steamed Hams refers to The Simpsons episode "22 Short Films About Springfield (The Simpsons)" segment "Skinner & The Superintendent" writing by Bill Oakley which turns Seymour Skinner (The Simpsons) and Gary Chalmers (The Simpsons) awkward relationship into a sitcom where Skinner serves Chalmers lunch, following the "Dinner with the Boss" trope. The episode aired on April 14th, 1996. It has since become ingrained into meme culture because of the humor behind it, turning into a meme across multiple internet community.
Skinner invites Chalmers to his house for lunch. After burnt (food) a roast he was preparing in his oven, he sneaks out his window to a nearby Krusty Burger (The Simpsons) to purchase burger and french fries. Returning from the kitchen, he serves Chalmers the burgers, who recognizes the taste. Skinner fumbles through his explanation about the origin, with the kitchen catching fire in the meantime. After entering and leaving the kitchen (finding out that it's engulfed in flames), Skinner attempts to get Chalmers out of the house. Chalmers, however, catches a glimpse of the fire and questions it, with Skinner saying that it's an aurora borealis. Skinner then escorts Chalmers out of the house while his mother Agnes Skinner (The Simpsons) screams about the worsening situation. As soon as Chalmers drives away (unaware of the fire), Skinner returns to the house to presumably fight the fire. The next shot fixates onto a fire truck before panning away to Homer Simpson (The Simpsons), transition to the next scene.
Chalmers: Well, Seymour, I made it, despite your directions.&spSkinner: Ah, Superintendent Chalmers, welcome. I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!&spChalmers: Yeah.&sp[Skinner runs to the kitchen, only to find his roast is burnt and gasps in horror]&spSkinner: Oh, egads! My roast is ruined! But what if I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? [chuckles] Delightfully devilish, Seymour.&sp[He begins to climb through the window, but Chalmers enters the kitchen. The theme song to an imaginary show called "Skinner and the Superintendent" then plays:]Chalmers: SEEEEEYMOOUUURRR!!!&spSkinner: Superintendent! I was just...uh---just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise! Care to join me?&spChalmers: Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?&spSkinner: Uh... ooh! That isn't smoke, it's steam! Steam from the steamed clams we're having. Mmmm, steamed clams!&sp[Once Chalmers leaves the kitchen, Skinner breathes a sigh of relief, climbs out the window, and runs across the street to Krusty Burger, where he buys hamburgers and french fries to replace his burnt roast. He enters the dining room with the fast food on a silver tray.]&spSkinner: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouthwatering hamburgers.&spChalmers: I thought we were having steamed clams.&spSkinner: Oh no, I said 'steamed hams'. That's what I call hamburgers.&spChalmers: You call hamburgers 'steamed hams'?&spSkinner: Yes! It's a regional dialect.&spChalmers: Uh-huh. Eh, what region?&spSkinner: Uh...upstate New York.&spChalmers: Really? Well I'm from Utica and I've never heard anyone use the phrase 'steamed hams'.&spSkinner: Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.&spChalmers: I see.&sp[Chalmers takes a bite out of a burger and chews it a little, while Skinner sips his drink.]&spChalmers: You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones they have at Krusty Burger.&spSkinner: Hohoho, no! Patented Skinner Burgers. Old family recipe!&spChalmers: For steamed hams?&spSkinner: Yes.&spChalmers: Yes, and you call them steamed hams, despite the fact they are obviously grilled.&spSkinner: Y- Uh.. you know, the... One thing I should... excuse me for one second.&spChalmers: Of course.&sp[Skinner enters and leaves the kitchen swiftly upon seeing it is now on fire]&spSkinner: [yawns] Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped.&spChalmers: Yes, I should be--good lord, what is happening in there?!&spSkinner: Aurora Borealis?&spChalmers: Ah- Aurora Borealis?! At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?!&spSkinner: Yes.&spChalmers: ...May I see it?&spSkinner: ...No.&sp[They exit the house as the kitchen fire grows larger.]&spAgnes: Seymour! The house is on fire!&spSkinner: No, mother, it's just the Northern Lights.&spChalmers: Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say... you steam a good ham.&sp[As Chalmers begins heading home, Agnes screams for help, causing Chalmers to look back towards the house. Skinner gives him a thumbs up and a fake smile, causing him to keep walking away. Once Chalmers is out of sight, Skinner rushes back into the house to deal with the fire.]&spAgnes: Help! HELP!!!
Steamed Hams was written by Bill Oakley for "22 Short Films About Springfield", which he now views as his most famous work. The origin of the segment is tied closely with the origin of the episode, where the writer wanted to add more scenes with background character, dedicating an entire episode around the idea. The staff were assigned parts based on their favorite character, which for Oakley was Chalmers. This was following "Bart on the Road (The Simpsons)", where Skinner's awkward interaction with Chalmers has him end up sending all the student to an impromptu Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day (named "go to work with your parents day" in the episode). He wanted to stretch out how Skinner lying to its limit, coming up with the idea for "Skinner & The Superintendent".&pIn 2020, The Simpsons (season 32), there is an episode "The Road to Cincinnati (The Simpsons)" that stretched the fundamental idea behind "Skinner & The Superintendent" into a full episode about a road trip with Skinner and Chalmers after several mishap, where halarity ensues. There is a reference to Steamed Hams in the form of a passing restaurant during the road trip.
There are several animation error that occurred during the segment, which have been sought out and noted. The most well-known is when Chalmers takes a visible bite into the burger, to then show it to Skinners with the patty untouched. Some relate to discoloration or perspective issues, while others relate to continuity error. When Chalmers opens the door to the kitchen, it is magically closed in the next shot. There are a plethora of small marks and lines that are left on frame (animation). When Skinner sets out four burgers, and they each take one burger, there is only one burger left (phantom burger).
Steams Hams has since become a meme, garnering video, video game, song, tattoo, art, and other media related to Steamed Hams.
Steamed Hams but... refers to videos on YouTube that spin the formula or content of Steamed Hams in a different direction. These are often humor in nature and many are well-made.</div>
