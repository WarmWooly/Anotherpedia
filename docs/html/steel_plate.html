  <h1>Steel plate</h1>
  <div>A steel plate is a metal plate made of steel. Steel plates, as a structural steel, are often used in construction of building and vehicle as they can be metal cutting, metal forming, and welding together while being cheap and sturdy. Steel plates must be thicker than 6 millimeter, or else they're considered a steel sheet or steel foil.</div>
