      <h1>Steel plate</h1>
      <div>A steel plate is a metal plate made of steel. Steel plates, as a structural steel, are often used in construction of buildings and vehicles as they can be cut to size, formed, and welded together while being cheap and sturdy. Steel plates must be thicker than 6 mm, or else they're considered a steel sheet or foil.</div>
