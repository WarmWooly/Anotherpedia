      <h1>Steel Plate (Advanced Rocketry - Reworked)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The steel plate is an item in the Minecraft mod Advanced Rocketry - Reworked used in crafting rocket parts, circuit boards, and machines.



In a rolling machine, a steel ingot and 100 mB of water can be rolled into a steel plate. The process requires 6000 RF over 15 seconds (20 RF/t).

In a small plate presser, a steel block can be pressed into 4 steel plates.



Steel plates are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Advanced Motor - 3 steel plates, 2 gold coils, and 2 steel rods (place a rod in the center, a rod to its left, the coils above and below, and the plates in the right column).<br>Atmosphere Detector - 4 steel plates, 1 basic circuit, 1 iron bars, 1 machine structure, 1 steel fan, and 1 user interface (place the structure in the center, the plates in the corners, then going clockwise from the top side: the interface, fan, circuit, and bars).<br>Bipropellant Fuel Tank - 2 steel plates, 4 steel rods, and 1 steel sheet (place the sheet in the center, the plates to the left and right, and the rods in the corners).<br>Bipropellant Rocket Engine - 3 steel plates and 3 titanium ingots (place a plate in the center and the bottom corners, and fill the top row with ingots).<br>Centrifuge - 2 steel plates, 1 control circuit board, 2 iron rods, 1 liquid IO circuit board, 1 machine structure, 1 steel fan, and 1 user interface (place the structure in the center, the rods in the top corners, the plates in the bottom corners, then going clockwise from the top side: the interface, control circuit, fan, and liquid IO circuit).<br>Crystallizer - 1 steel plate, 1 control circuit board, 1 item IO circuit board, 1 machine structure, 1 user interface, 2 nether quartz, and 2 redstone repeaters (place the structure in the center, the quartz in the top corners, the repeaters in the bottom corners, then going clockwise from the top side: the interface, control circuit, plate, and item IO circuit).<br>Cutting Machine - 1 steel plate, 1 control circuit board, 1 item IO circuit board, 1 machine structure, 2 steel gears, 1 user interface and 2 obsidian (place the structure in the center, the gears in the top corners, the obsidian in the bottom corners, then going clockwise from the top side: the interface, control circuit, plate, and item IO circuit).<br>Electrolyzer - 2 steel plates, 2 basic circuits, 1 control circuit board, 1 liquid IO circuit board, 1 machine structure, 1 user interface, and 1 redstone torch (place the machine structure in the center, the plates in the top corners, the basic circuits in the bottom corners, then going clockwise from the top side: the interface, control circuit, torch, and liquid IO circuit).<br>Gas Charge Pad - 2 steel plates, 1 machine structure, 2 monopropellant fuel tanks, 2 steel fans, 1 user interface, and 1 weighted pressure plate (heavy) (place the structure in the center, the interface above, the pressure plate below, the tanks to the left and right, the fans in the top corners, and the steel plates in the bottom corners).<br>Lathe - 2 steel plates, 1 control circuit board, 2 iron rods, 1 item IO circuit board, 1 machine structure 1 steel gear, and 1 user interface (place the structure in the center, the iron rods in the top corners, the plates in the bottom corners, then going clockwise from the top side: the interface, control circuit, gear, and item IO circuit).<br>Monopropellant Fuel Tank - 2 steel plates, 4 steel rods, and 1 steel sheet (place the rods in the corners, the plates on the left and right sides, and the sheet on the bottom side).<br>Motor - 3 steel plates, 2 copper coils, and 2 steel rods (place a rod in the center, a rod to its left, the coils above and below, and the plates in the right column).<br>Oxidizer Fuel Tank - 2 steel plates, 4 steel rods, and 1 steel sheet (place the rods in the corners, the plates on the left and right sides, and the sheet on the top side).<br>Seat - 1 steel plate and 2 wool (place the plate in the center and the wool to its left and right).<br>Small Airlock Door - 6 steel plates (fill the left and center columns with plates).<br>Steel Fan - 4 steel plates and 1 steel rod (place the rod in the center and the plates in the corners).<br>Steel Gear - 2 steel plates, 1 steel ingot, and 4 steel rods (place the ingot in the center, the plates above and below, and the rods in the corners).<br>Suit Jetpack - 1 steel plate, 2 pressure tanks, 2 fire charges, 2 levers, and 1 string (place the string in the center, the levers to the left and right, the plate above, the tanks in the top corners, and the charges in the bottom corners).<br>Warp Controller - 4 steel plates, 1 advanced circuit, 2 control circuit boards, 1 machine structure, and 1 user interface (place the structure in the center, the user interface above, the advanced circuit below, the circuit boards to the left and right, and the plates in the corners).<br>Warp Core - 2 steel plates, 2 advanced circuits, 1 copper coil, and 4 titanium plates (place the coil in the center, the circuits above and below, the steel plates to the left and right, and the titanium plates in the corners).

Steel plates are used in the following precision assembler recipes:<br>Control Circuit Board - 1 steel plate, 1 copper plate, and 1 redstone (2000 RF over 10 secs; 10 RF/t).<br>Item IO Circuit Board - 1 steel plate, 1 gold plate, and 1 redstone (2000 RF over 10 secs; 10 RF/t).<br>Liquid IO Circuit Board - 1 steel plate, 1 lapis lazuli, and 1 redstone (2000 RF over 10 secs; 10 RF/t).<br>Nuclear Thermal Fission Core - 8 steel plates, 1 advanced circuit, 1 advanced machine structure, and 32 dilithium crystals (500000 RF over 100 secs; 250 RF/t).

In a rolling machine, 1 steel plate and 100 mB of water can be rolled into a steel sheet. The process requires 60000 RF over 15 seconds (200 RF/t).</div>
