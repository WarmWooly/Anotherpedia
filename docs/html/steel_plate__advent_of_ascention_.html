Steel plates, when normally placed, will take up a flat plane (like a carpet). The plate will align with whatever surface it's placed on. When trying to place another steel plate, one of the sides will be added. This can be repeated until a full block is constructed. When broken, all steel plates placed will drop. Placing a steel plate while sneaking will cause a full block to be placed instead.</div>
