Steel plates, when normally placed, will take up a flat plane (like a carpet (Minecraft)). The plate will align with whatever surface it's placed on. When trying to place another steel plate, one of the sides will be added. This can be repeated until a full block is constructed. When broken, all steel plates placed will drop. Placing a steel plate while sneaking (Minecraft) will cause a full block to be placed instead.</div>
