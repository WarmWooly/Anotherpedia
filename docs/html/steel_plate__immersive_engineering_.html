      <h1>Steel Plate (Immersive Engineering)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>The steel plate is an item in the Minecraft mod Immersive Engineering used in producing various steel-based crafting components, the metal press molds, and steel armor.
A steel plate can be crafted with a steel ingot and an engineer's hammer (shapeless).
Placing a steel ingot onto a metal press with a metal press mold: plate will produce a steel plate.
Steel plates are used in the following crafting recipes:&spExtended Magazine - 2 steel plates, 4 copper wires, and 1 iron mechanical component (place the component in the bottom-left corner, the plates in the center and top-right corner, and the wires on the sides).&spFocused Nozzle - 2 steel plates, 2 fluid pipes, and 1 iron mechanical component (place the component in the bottom right corner, the plates above and to the side of it, and the pipes in the center and top-left slots).&spHeavy Plated Shield - 6 steel plates, 2 treated wood planks, and 1 shield (place the shield in the center, the planks above and below it, and the plates in the left and right columns).&spLarge Tank - 4 steel plates, 1 fluid pipe, and 2 red dye (place the pipe in the top-left corner, the dyes in the center and bottom-right corner, and the plates on the sides).&spRazor Wire x3 - 1 steel plate, 3 steel wires, and 2 treated wood fences (place the plate in the center, the wires to the left, right, and below of it, and the fences in the bottom corners).&spReinforced Blast Brick - 1 steel plate and 1 blast brick (shapeless).&spRevolver Drum - 4 steel plates and 1 steel rod (place the rod in the center and the plates to the sides).&spRock Softening Acid - 3 steel plates, 2 buckets of redstone acid, 2 fluid pipes, and 1 steel mechanical component (place the component in the bottom-right corner, the pipes to the left, the plates on the left, right, and top sides, and the buckets in the center and top-left slots).&spRockcutter Blade - 4 steel plates and 4 diamonds (place the diamonds in the corners and the plates on the edges).&spSawblade - 4 steel plates and 4 steel ingots (place the ingots in the corners and the plates on the edges).&spSteel Boots - 4 steel plates (place two sheets in the bottom corners and two above those).&spSteel Chestplate - 8 steel plates (fill the entire grid besides the top middle slot).&spSteel Helmet - 5 steel plates (fill the middle and bottom rows besides the bottom middle slot).&spSteel Leggings - 7 steel plates (fill the entire grid besides the center middle and bottom middle slots).&spSteel Mechanical Component - 4 steel plates and 1 copper ingot (place the copper in the center and the plates in the corners).&spSteel Sheetmetal x4 - 4 steel plates (place the plates on the edges in a circle).&spSteel Wire - 1 steel plate and 1 engineer's wire cutters (shapeless).
In an engineer's workbench, the following items can be produced using steel plates:&spBanner Pattern Plating - 1 steel plate, 1 paper, and 1 engineer's blueprint Banner Patterns&spMetal Press Mold: Bullet Casing/Gear/Packing 2x2/Packing 3x3/Plate/Rod/Unpacking/Wire - 3 steel plates, 1 engineer's wire cutters, and 1 engineer's blueprint Metal Press Molds&spSteel Mechanical Component - 2 steel plates, 1 copper ingot, and 1 engineer's blueprint Crafting Components
In an Arc Furnace, a steel plate can be recycled into a steel ingot.</div>
