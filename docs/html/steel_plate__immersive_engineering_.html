      <h1>Steel Plate (Immersive Engineering)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The steel plate is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Immersive Engineering used in producing various steel ingot (immersive engineering)-based crafting components, the metal press molds (Immerseive Engineering), and steel armor (immersive engineering).



A steel plate can be crafting (Minecraft) with a steel ingot (Immersive Engineering) and an engineer's hammer (Immersive Engineering) (shapeless).

Placing a steel ingot (Immersive Engineering) onto a metal press (Immersive Engineering) with a metal press mold: plate (Immersive Engineering) will produce a steel plate.



Steel plates are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Extended Magazine (Immersive Engineering) - 2 steel plates, 4 copper wire (Immersive Engineering), and 1 iron mechanical component (Immersive Engineering) (place the component in the bottom-left corner, the plates in the center and top-right corner, and the wires on the sides).<br>Focused Nozzle (Immersive Engineering) - 2 steel plates, 2 fluid pipe (Immersive Engineering), and 1 iron mechanical component (Immersive Engineering) (place the component in the bottom right corner, the plates above and to the side of it, and the pipes in the center and top-left slots).<br>Heavy Plated Shield (Immersive Engineering) - 6 steel plates, 2 treated wood planks (Immersive Engineering), and 1 shield (Minecraft) (place the shield in the center, the planks above and below it, and the plates in the left and right columns).<br>Large Tank (Immersive Engineering) - 4 steel plates, 1 fluid pipe (Immersive Engineering), and 2 red dye (Minecraft) (place the pipe in the top-left corner, the dyes in the center and bottom-right corner, and the plates on the sides).<br>Razor Wire (Immersive Engineering) x3 - 1 steel plate, 3 steel wire (Immersive Engineering), and 2 treated wood fence (Immersive Engineering) (place the plate in the center, the wires to the left, right, and below of it, and the fences in the bottom corners).<br>Reinforced Blast Brick (Immersive Engineering) - 1 steel plate and 1 blast brick (Immersive Engineering) (shapeless).<br>Revolver Drum (Immersive Engineering) - 4 steel plates and 1 steel rod (Immersive Engineering) (place the rod in the center and the plates to the sides).<br>Rock Softening Acid (Immersive Engineering) - 3 steel plates, 2 bucket of redstone acid (Immersive Engineering), 2 fluid pipe (Immersive Engineering), and 1 steel mechanical component (Immersive Engineering) (place the component in the bottom-right corner, the pipes to the left, the plates on the left, right, and top sides, and the buckets in the center and top-left slots).<br>Rockcutter Blade (Immersive Engineering) - 4 steel plates and 4 diamond (Minecraft) (place the diamonds in the corners and the plates on the edges).<br>Sawblade (Immersive Engineering) - 4 steel plates and 4 steel ingot (Immersive Engineering) (place the ingots in the corners and the plates on the edges).<br>Steel Boots (Immersive Engineering) - 4 steel plates (place two sheets in the bottom corners and two above those).<br>Steel Chestplate (Immersive Engineering) - 8 steel plates (fill the entire grid besides the top middle slot).<br>Steel Helmet (Immersive Engineering) - 5 steel plates (fill the middle and bottom rows besides the bottom middle slot).<br>Steel Leggings (Immersive Engineering) - 7 steel plates (fill the entire grid besides the center middle and bottom middle slots).<br>Steel Mechanical Component (Immersive Engineering) - 4 steel plates and 1 copper ingot (Minecraft) (place the copper in the center and the plates in the corners).<br>Steel Sheetmetal (Immersive Engineering) x4 - 4 steel plates (place the plates on the edges in a circle).<br>Steel Wire (Immersive Engineering) - 1 steel plate and 1 engineer's wire cutters (Immersive Engineering) (shapeless).

In an engineer's workbench (Immersive Engineering), the following items can be produced using steel plates:<br>Banner Pattern Plating (Immersive Engineering) - 1 steel plate, 1 paper (Minecraft), and 1 engineer's blueprint Banner Patterns (Immersive Engineering)<br>Metal Press Mold: Bullet Casing (Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Gear (Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Packing 2x2(Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Packing 3x3 (Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Plate (Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Rod (Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Unpacking (Immersive Engineering)/Metal Press Mold: Wire (Immersive Engineering) - 3 steel plates, 1 engineer's wire cutters (Immersive Engineering), and 1 engineer's blueprint Metal Press Molds (Immersive Engineering)<br>Steel Mechanical Component<br>[[Banner Pattern Plating|Banner Pattern Plating (Immersive Engineering) - 2 steel plates, 1 copper ingot (Minecraft), and 1 engineer's blueprint Crafting Components (Immersive Engineering)

In an Arc Furnace (Immersive Engineering), a steel plate can be recycled into a steel ingot (Immersive Engineering).</div>
