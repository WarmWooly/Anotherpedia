      <h1>Steel Plate (Immersive Engineering)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The steel plate is an item in the Minecraft mod Immersive Engineering used in producing various steel-based crafting components, the metal press molds, and steel armor.



A steel plate can be crafted with a steel ingot and an engineer's hammer (shapeless).

Placing a steel ingot onto a metal press with a metal press mold: plate will produce a steel plate.



Steel plates are used in the following crafting recipes:<br>Extended Magazine - 2 steel plates, 4 copper wires, and 1 iron mechanical component (place the component in the bottom-left corner, the plates in the center and top-right corner, and the wires on the sides).<br>Focused Nozzle - 2 steel plates, 2 fluid pipes, and 1 iron mechanical component (place the component in the bottom right corner, the plates above and to the side of it, and the pipes in the center and top-left slots).<br>Heavy Plated Shield - 6 steel plates, 2 treated wood planks, and 1 shield (place the shield in the center, the planks above and below it, and the plates in the left and right columns).<br>Large Tank - 4 steel plates, 1 fluid pipe, and 2 red dye (place the pipe in the top-left corner, the dyes in the center and bottom-right corner, and the plates on the sides).<br>Razor Wire x3 - 1 steel plate, 3 steel wires, and 2 treated wood fences (place the plate in the center, the wires to the left, right, and below of it, and the fences in the bottom corners).<br>Reinforced Blast Brick - 1 steel plate and 1 blast brick (shapeless).<br>Revolver Drum - 4 steel plates and 1 steel rod (place the rod in the center and the plates to the sides).<br>Rock Softening Acid - 3 steel plates, 2 buckets of redstone acid, 2 fluid pipes, and 1 steel mechanical component (place the component in the bottom-right corner, the pipes to the left, the plates on the left, right, and top sides, and the buckets in the center and top-left slots).<br>Rockcutter Blade - 4 steel plates and 4 diamonds (place the diamonds in the corners and the plates on the edges).<br>Sawblade - 4 steel plates and 4 steel ingots (place the ingots in the corners and the plates on the edges).<br>Steel Boots - 4 steel plates (place two sheets in the bottom corners and two above those).<br>Steel Chestplate - 8 steel plates (fill the entire grid besides the top middle slot).<br>Steel Helmet - 5 steel plates (fill the middle and bottom rows besides the bottom middle slot).<br>Steel Leggings - 7 steel plates (fill the entire grid besides the center middle and bottom middle slots).<br>Steel Mechanical Component - 4 steel plates and 1 copper ingot (place the copper in the center and the plates in the corners).<br>Steel Sheetmetal x4 - 4 steel plates (place the plates on the edges in a circle).<br>Steel Wire - 1 steel plate and 1 engineer's wire cutters (shapeless).

In an engineer's workbench, the following items can be produced using steel plates:<br>Banner Pattern Plating - 1 steel plate, 1 paper, and 1 engineer's blueprint Banner Patterns<br>Metal Press Mold: Bullet Casing/Gear/Packing 2x2/Packing 3x3/Plate/Rod/Unpacking/Wire - 3 steel plates, 1 engineer's wire cutters, and 1 engineer's blueprint Metal Press Molds<br>Steel Mechanical Component - 2 steel plates, 1 copper ingot, and 1 engineer's blueprint Crafting Components

In an Arc Furnace, a steel plate can be recycled into a steel ingot.</div>
