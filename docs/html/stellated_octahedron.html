      <h1>Stellated octahedron</h1>
      <div>A stellated octahedron is a 3D shape consisting of an octahedron that has been stellated (as seen by the 8 triangular prism-shaped points) on all sides. It resembles a pair of intersecting triangular prisms with one rotated 180 degrees on a single axis. A stellated octahedron has 8 triangular faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.</div>
