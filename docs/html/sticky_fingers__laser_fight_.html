      <h1>Sticky Fingers (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Sticky Fingers is a kill streak in Laser Fight that allows the player to pick up any gun instantly. When a sticky player attempts to grab a gun (even if they fail due to a full inventory), the gun will become sticky, allowing anyone to instantly pick it up. Guns grabbed with Sticky Fingers will remain sticky when dropped. This streak is disabled in the Starting Weapons, Arsenal, and One Gun Run modes.<<tableLevel|Skill Points|Kill Points|Effect||rLvl. 1|r-|r2|Stickstable>></div>
