  <h1>Sticky Fingers (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>Sticky Fingers is a kill streak (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) that allows the player to pick up any gun (Laser Fight) instantly. When a sticky player attempts to grab a gun (even if they fail due to a full inventory), the gun will become sticky, allowing anyone to instantly pick it up. Guns grabbed with Sticky Fingers will remain sticky when dropped. This streak is disabled in the Starting Weapons (Laser Fight), Arsenal (Laser Fight), and One Gun Run (Laser Fight) mode (Laser Fight).<<tableLevel|Skill Points|Kill Points|Effect||rLvl. 1|r-|r2|Stickstable>></div>
