      <h1>Stone Flushwork (Knapped)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|Wooden pickaxe||Blast resistance|6||Hardness|1.5||Luminous|No||Transparent|No||Flammable|No||Fire/lava&spresistance|Noinfo>>Stone flushwork are a set of stone-based blocks in the Minecraft mod Knapped that can be interchanged between each other in a Stonecutter. The only stone flushwork not included within this set is for the Thing, which requires an enchanted golden apple. The set includes the Bar, Body, Checkerboard, Cross, Crowd, Diamonds, Flower, Fortress, Panel, Point, Quarters, and Ring.



The only craftable flushwork is the Panel, using 1 stone and 2 knapped flint bricks (item) (shapeless).



All types of stone flushwork (besides Thing) can be cut in a Stonecutter to make the other types of flushwork.</div>
