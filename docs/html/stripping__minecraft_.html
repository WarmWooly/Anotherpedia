      <h1>Stripping (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>For the action of removing wax from a block, see scraping ({{aiMinecraft).}}&spStripping is an action in Minecraft of converting log-type blocks into a version with the top layer (mostly bark) "removed". Once a block is stripped, it cannot be unstripped. To strip a block, use any axe on the wood. Stripping wood takes 1 durability from the axe per use (not accounting for Unbreaking). There is no delay between stripping blocks. The following table is for all the blocks that can be converted through stripping:<<tableBlock|Stripped||Oak Log|Stripped Oak Log||Oak Wood|Stripped Oak Wood||Spruce Log|Stripped Spruce Log||Spruce Wood|Stripped Spruce Wood||Birch Log|Stripped Birch Log||Birch Wood|Stripped Birch Wood||Jungle Log|Stripped Jungle Log||Jungle Wood|Stripped Jungle Wood||Acacia Log|Stripped Acacia Log||Acacia Wood|Stripped Acacia Wood||Dark Oak Log|Stripped Dark Oak Log||Dark Oak Wood|Stripped Dark Oak Wood||Mangrove Log|Stripped Mangrove Log||Mangrove Wood|Stripped Mangrove Wood||Cherry Log|Stripped Cherry Log||Cherry Wood|Stripped Cherry Wood||Block of Bamboo|Block of Stripped Bamboo||Pale Oak Log|Stripped Pale Oak Log||Pale Oak Wood|Stripped Pale Oak Wood||Crimson Stem|Stripped Crimson Stem||Crimson Hyphae|Stripped Crimson Hyphae||Warped Stem|Stripped Warped Stem||Warped Hyphae|Stripped Warped Hyphaetable>>
Because an axe is an often used and held tool/weapon, players may hold one while going around their base. Logs and wood are used as decorative blocks to make more "realistic"-looking bases and may be used as a part of the design. Since it only takes one misinput to strip a block, there are many stories where players report that they accidentally stripped a part of their base, with many memes cropping from such a phenomenon, especially on Reddit. A popular variation of the meme is when after a player accidentally strips one log, they go around their entire base and strip the rest to match.</div>
