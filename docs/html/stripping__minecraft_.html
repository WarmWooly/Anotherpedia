Once a block is stripped, it cannot be unstripped. To strip a block, use any [[axe|axe (Minecraft)]] on the wood. Stripping wood takes 1 [[durability|durability (Minecraft)]] from the axe per use (not accounting for [[Unbreaking|Unbreaking (Minecraft)]]). There is no delay between stripping blocks. The following table is for all the blocks that can be converted through stripping:<<table{{bBlock}}|{{bStripped}}||[[Oak Log|Oak Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Oak Log|Stripped Oak Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Oak Wood|Oak Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Oak Wood|Stripped Oak Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Spruce Log|Spruce Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Spruce Log|Stripped Spruce Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Spruce Wood|Spruce Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Spruce Wood|Stripped Spruce Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Birch Log|Birch Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Birch Log|Stripped Birch Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Birch Wood|Birch Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Birch Wood|Stripped Birch Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Jungle Log|Jungle Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Jungle Log|Stripped Jungle Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Jungle Wood|Jungle Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Jungle Wood|Stripped Jungle Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Acacia Log|Acacia Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Acacia Log|Stripped Acacia Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Acacia Wood|Acacia Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Acacia Wood|Stripped Acacia Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Dark Oak Log|Dark Oak Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Dark Oak Log|Stripped Dark Oak Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Dark Oak Wood|Dark Oak Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Dark Oak Wood|Stripped Dark Oak Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Mangrove Log|Mangrove Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Mangrove Log|Stripped Mangrove Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Mangrove Wood|Mangrove Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Mangrove Wood|Stripped Mangrove Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Cherry Log|Cherry Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Cherry Log|Stripped Cherry Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Cherry Wood|Cherry Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Cherry Wood|Stripped Cherry Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Block of Bamboo|Block of Bamboo (Minecraft)]]|[[Block of Stripped Bamboo|Block of Stripped Bamboo (Minecraft)]]||[[Pale Oak Log|Pale Oak Log (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Pale Oak Log|Stripped Pale Oak Log (Minecraft)]]||[[Pale Oak Wood|Pale Oak Wood (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Pale Oak Wood|Stripped Pale Oak Wood (Minecraft)]]||[[Crimson Stem|Crimson Stem (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Crimson Stem|Stripped Crimson Stem (Minecraft)]]||[[Crimson Hyphae|Crimson Hyphae (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Crimson Hyphae|Stripped Crimson Hyphae (Minecraft)]]||[[Warped Stem|Warped  Stem (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Warped Stem|Stripped Warped Stem (Minecraft)]]||[[Warped Hyphae|Warped Hyphae (Minecraft)]]|[[Stripped Warped Hyphae|Stripped Warped Hyphae (Minecraft)]]table>><<hrAccidentally strippinghr>><<img(src=git/stripping accident minecraft.png(cap=An accidentally stripped log on a base.img>>Because an axe is an often used and held [[tool|tool (Minecraft)]]/[[weapon|weapon (Minecraft)]], [[players|player (Minecraft)]] may hold one while going around their [[base|base (Minecraft)]]. Logs and wood are used as decorative blocks to make more "realistic"-looking bases and may be used as a part of the design. Since it only takes one [[misinput]] to strip a block, there are many stories where players report that they accidentally stripped a part of their base, with many [[memes|internet meme]] cropping from such a phenomenon, especially on [[Reddit]]. A popular variation of the meme is when after a player accidentally strips one log, they go around their entire base and strip the rest to match.</div>
