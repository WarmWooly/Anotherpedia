      <h1>Stuffed toy</h1>
      <div>A stuffed toy (also called stuffed animals, plushes, or plushies) are a toy with internal stuffing contained within a textile covering. Stuffed toys often resemble animals (hence the common name), but they may also resemble humans, characters, fictional creatures, or objects (such as food or vehicles). Stuffed toys are used by both children and adults for playing, sleeping, and displaying. They can be industrially manufactured or homemade, making them widespread among households.</div>
