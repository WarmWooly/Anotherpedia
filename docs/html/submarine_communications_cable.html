      <h1>Submarine communications cable</h1>
      <div>A submarine communications cable, also known as a submarine cable, a sea cable, or an underwater cable, is a cable on the seabed used for telecommunication across ocean and sea. They originated in the form of telegraphy cables, such as the project across the Atlantic Ocean in 1854-1858 known as a transatlantic telegraph cable. These cables used to hold solid copper cable, but fiber optic cable would start being used in place of copper in 1988. Nearly all data communication between continent rely on submarine communication cables.<br><br>Modern cables have an optic fiber covered in silicon gel, plastic, steel wire, copper, and nylon to protect against damage caused by wildlife, weather, fishing, and anchor. These wires are made to be hundreds to thousands of mile in length as they cross vast distance. Special ship are designed for laying down this cable.</div>
