They originated in the form of [[telegraphy]] cables, such as the project across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1854-1858 known as a [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]. These cables used to hold solid [[copper cables|copper cable]], but [[fiber optic cables|fiber optic cable]] would start being used in place of copper in 1988. Nearly all [[data communications|data communication]] between [[continents|continent]] rely on submarine communication cables.&pModern cables have an optic fiber covered in [[silicon gel]], [[plastic]], [[steel wires|steel wire]], [[copper]], and [[nylon]] to protect against [[damage]] caused by [[wildlife]], [[weather]], [[fishing]], and [[anchors|anchor]]. These wires are made to be hundreds to thousands of [[miles|mile]] in length as they cross vast [[distances|distance]]. Special [[ships|ship]] are designed for laying down this cable.</div>
