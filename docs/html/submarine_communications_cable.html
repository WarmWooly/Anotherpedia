      <h1>Submarine communications cable</h1>
      <div>A submarine communications cable, also known as a submarine cable, a sea cable, or an underwater cable, is a cable on the seabed used for telecommunications across oceans and seas. They originated in the form of telegraphy cables, such as the project across the Atlantic Ocean in 1854-1858 known as a transatlantic telegraph cable. These cables used to hold solid copper cables, but fiber optic cables would start being used in place of copper in 1988. Nearly all data communications between continents rely on submarine communication cables.&pModern cables have an optic fiber covered in silicon gel, plastic, steel wires, copper, and nylon to protect against damage caused by wildlife, weather, fishing, and anchors. These wires are made to be hundreds to thousands of miles in length as they cross vast distances. Special ships are designed for laying down this cable.</div>
