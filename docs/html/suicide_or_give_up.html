  <div><<shortDefeatist options in {{iDetroit: Become Huuman}}short>>{{tThis page contains [[spoilers|spoiler]] for the [[game|video game]] {{ai[[Detroit: Become Human]]}}.}}&sp<<img(src=git/suicide or give up.png(cap=Connor deciding what to do.img>>{{bSuicide or Give Up}} refers to a choice in {{i[[Detroit: Become Human]]}} made by [[Connor|Connor (Detriot: Become Human)]] at the end of Connor's [[last chapter|Connor at the CyberLife Tower (Detroit: Become Human)]].<<ref(content=link|https://detroitbecometext.github.io/chapters/38(text=refCountref>><<hrBackgroundhr>>Connor, a now [[deviant|deviant (Detroit: Become Human]] android, became the leader of the android revolution through neutralizing hundreds of other androids before storming [[Detroit|Detroit (Detroit: Become Human)]] on November 11, 2038. Connor is told to give a speech to the androids,<<note(content=Who tells Connor to go up is based on a priority system, with the highest alive member telling him. The order goes [[North|North (Detroit: Become Human)]], [[Simon|Simon (Detroit: Become Human)]], [[Josh|Josh (Detroit: Become Human)]], and then a nameless android if they are all dead.(text=noteCountnote>> leading Connor to walk onto a stage before them. [[Amanda|Amanda (Detroit: Become Human)]], the [[handler|handler (Detroit: Become Human)]] of Connor and an employee at [[CyberLife|CyberLife (Detroit: Become Human)]], explains to Connor how CyberLife used him to manufacture an android revolution with a sole leader who was under the control of a CyberLife member. Connor holds a pistol behind himself, with Amanda in disbelief that he'd "ruin it all now".<<hrSuicidehr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRxRrfLCYEc(cap=A video of the suicide ending.yt>>Upon selecting  "Suicide", Amanda tells Connor that they can't let him do that. Connor, going against the idea of giving up, searches for an emergency exit within his programming to override what is stopping him from killing himself through a walking section with an interactable object. With much strain, he overrides it. Connor slowly pulls the gun up to his chin, before cutting to black with a gunshot.<<hrGive Uphr>>Upon selecting "Give Up", Amanda tells him that they'll do great things together. Unlike the "Suicide" option, there is no additional gameplay as Connor's final chapter comes to a close.<<hrMemehr>><<img(src=git/suicide or give up meme.png(cap=A meme using "Suicide or Give Up".img>>With the options being so grim and [[defeatist]], it became used in [[memes|internet meme]] regarding options with no good outcomes. A humorous effect can be extruded through [[contrast|comedic contrast]], pairing [[mundane]] challenges with these two awful options. Many seem to relate to [[middle|middle school]] or [[high school]], which can be a period of high [[stress]] over minor difficulties, such as attempting a [[test|exam]], getting rejected by a [[crush|crush (relationship)]], or having your mom look through your [[group chat|group chat (colloquial)]].</div>
