      <h1>Suicide or Give Up</h1>
      <div>This page contains spoilers for the game {{aiDetroit: Become Human.}}&spSuicide or Give Up refers to a choice in Detroit: Become Human made by Connor at the end of Connor's last chapter.<<ref(content=link|https://detroitbecometext.github.io/chapters/38(text=refCountref>>
Connor, a now deviant android, became the leader of the android revolution through neutralizing hundreds of other androids before storming Detroit on November 11, 2038. Connor is told to give a speech to the androids,<<note(content=Who tells Connor to go up is based on a priority system, with the highest alive member telling him. The order goes North, Simon, Josh, and then a nameless android if they are all dead.(text=noteCountnote>> leading Connor to walk onto a stage before them. Amanda, the handler of Connor and an employee at CyberLife, explains to Connor how CyberLife used him to manufacture an android revolution with a sole leader who was under the control of a CyberLife member. Connor holds a pistol behind himself, with Amanda in disbelief that he'd "ruin it all now".
Upon selecting "Suicide", Amanda tells Connor that they can't let him do that. Connor, going against the idea of giving up, searches for an emergency exit within his programming to override what is stopping him from killing himself through a walking section with an interactable object. With much strain, he overrides it. Connor slowly pulls the gun up to his chin, before cutting to black with a gunshot.
Upon selecting "Give Up", Amanda tells him that they'll do great things together. Unlike the "Suicide" option, there is no additional gameplay as Connor's final chapter comes to a close.
With the options being so grim and defeatist, it became used in memes regarding options with no good outcomes. A humorous effect can be extruded through contrast, pairing mundane challenges with these two awful options. Many seem to relate to middle or high school, which can be a period of high stress over minor difficulties, such as attempting a test, getting rejected by a crush, or having your mom look through your group chat.</div>
