      <h1>Suicide or Give Up</h1>
      <div>This page contains spoiler for the video game {{aiDetroit: Become Human.}}<br>Suicide or Give Up refers to a choice in Detroit: Become Human made by Connor (Detriot: Become Human) at the end of Connor's Connor at the CyberLife Tower (Detroit: Become Human).

Connor, a now deviant (Detroit: Become Human android, became the leader of the android revolution through neutralizing hundreds of other androids before storming Detroit (Detroit: Become Human) on November 11, 2038. Connor is told to give a speech to the androids, leading Connor to walk onto a stage before them. Amanda (Detroit: Become Human), the handler (Detroit: Become Human) of Connor and an employee at CyberLife (Detroit: Become Human), explains to Connor how CyberLife used him to manufacture an android revolution with a sole leader who was under the control of a CyberLife member. Connor holds a pistol behind himself, with Amanda in disbelief that he'd "ruin it all now".

Upon selecting  "Suicide", Amanda tells Connor that they can't let him do that. Connor, going against the idea of giving up, searches for an emergency exit within his programming to override what is stopping him from killing himself through a walking section with an interactable object. With much strain, he overrides it. Connor slowly pulls the gun up to his chin, before cutting to black with a gunshot.

Upon selecting "Give Up", Amanda tells him that they'll do great things together. Unlike the "Suicide" option, there is no additional gameplay as Connor's final chapter comes to a close.

With the options being so grim and defeatist, it became used in internet meme regarding options with no good outcomes. A humorous effect can be extruded through comedic contrast, pairing mundane challenges with these two awful options. Many seem to relate to middle school or high school, which can be a period of high stress over minor difficulties, such as attempting a exam, getting rejected by a crush (relationship), or having your mom look through your group chat (colloquial).</div>
