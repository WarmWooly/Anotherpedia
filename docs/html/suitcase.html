      <h1>Suitcase</h1>
      <div>A suitcase is a baggage used for holding personal belonging while travel, including clothing, personal care products, and personal device. Suitcases may have wheel and handle to aid in moving the case around without carrying the entirety of it. Suitcases are prevalent at airport for commercial aviation and hotel during trip and vacation. Many material, including metal, plastic, and textile, can be used for suitcases. While the shape tends to be rectangular, the size of the suitcases varies depending on the carrier's use case.</div>
