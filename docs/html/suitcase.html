      <h1>Suitcase</h1>
      <div>A suitcase is a baggage used for holding personal belongings while travelling, including clothing, personal care products, and electronics. Suitcases may have wheels and handles to aid in moving the case around without carrying the entirety of it. Suitcases are prevalent at airports for commercial air travel and hotels during trips and vacations. Many materials, including metal, plastic, and textiles, can be used for suitcases. While the shape tends to be rectangular, the size of the suitcases varies depending on the carrier's use case.</div>
