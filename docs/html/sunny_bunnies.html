      <h1>Sunny Bunnies</h1>
      <div>{{bSunny Bunnies}} is an animated TV show made for children that released in 2015. The series currently has 7 seasons, each with 26 episodes. Sunny Bunnies was produced by Digital Light Studio all the way to partway through season 7, which was then changed to be produced by Animation Café, who is continuing season 7. Sunny Bunnies have two mobile apps, Sunny Bunnies: Magic Pop and Sunny Bunnies: Coloring Book.
Sunny Bunnies revolves around the five bunnies, Boo, Hopper, Iris, Shiny, and Turbo, who come from the Sun (hence Sunny Bunnies). Most episodes start with the bunnies being transported to a random location on what is likely Earth. There are often different props which the bunnies interact with, causing some sort of conflict between the bunnies. Slapstick is a prominent feature of their endeavors. The end of each episode has a blooper reel where it shows mistakes made during production or clips from the episode. Based on this information, Sunny Bunnies would be a live-action show in the Sunny Bunnies universe.&pEpisodes in seasons 2 and 3 introduce an antagonist The Big Gray Wolf who comes from the Moon, who is always defeated during his attempts to eat the bunnies, often by accident. The Big Gray Wolf shares a similar dynamic to Wile E. Coyote, where despite the elaborate traps, they always fail to catch their prey. Starting in season 4, a robot Robot S-Marty appears, who cleans up the park and has a positive relationship with the bunnies.</div>
