      <h1>Super Bomb Survival</h1>
      <div>{{iSuper Bomb Survival}} is a game on Roblox developed by Polyhex (Roblox User). The main goal of the game is to Survival falling bomb until the round ends. You can buy skills (abilities that have a cooldown) and perks (abilities that are always active) using credits earned by surviving. In turn, skills and perks make it easier to survive, creating a positive feedback loop.

Each round is 2 minute and 30 second, and is given a random intensity score, which determines the difficulty of the round, alongside a map selected out of 3 choices during intermission. Survival time, intensity, and various other bonuses determine credits earned in a round, alongside credits grabbed off the ground. With hardcore enabled, you have less HP and all perks are locked, but you earn more credits per round.<br><br>There are a large number of bombs that can fall in a round, such as bombs that explode, bombs that make ground dangerous, bombs that chase after you, Missile that slowly travel toward the ground, bombs that look like fallen credits, and more. The types of bomb and quantity are determined by the intensity of a round.<br><br>There are also more modes, such as Big Server (25 players max), Super Intense (round intensity is always set to 5.0), and Randomizer (random skill/perk given each round).

Skills are bought through a lootbox system, where the user will get a random skill based on movement, offense, or defense. You can only have one active skill at a time. Perks are purchased like normal items in a shop, and are thus not random. You can have up to two perks at a time, with the first slot being free and the second slot requiring Robux. There is also a premium currency called gems that can be purchased with Robux. Gems can be used to buy skills and perks, increase HP, increase credits earned, select the next round's map, increase/decrease the next round's intensity, packs (new skills, skill buffs), and gamepasses.<br><br>You are able to earn Badge (Roblox) for a variety of things, such as time played, rounds won in a row, finding a hidden banana, picking up credits, and dying at the end of a round. You are able to display your badge on your Nametag (Roblox).<br><br>There are 11 stats that are kept track of:<br>Time Played<br>Rounds Played<br>Rounds Won<br>Pizzas Eaten<br>Credits Grabbed<br>Intense Wins<br>Hardcore Wins<br>Total Score<br>Best Streak<br>Challenges Complete<br>6.0 Wins<br><br>The game has 5 toggleable binary options: one for music, one for hardcore mode, one for Player Versus Player, one for screen shake, and one for Away From Keyboard.</div>
