  <h1>{{iSuper Bomb Survival}}</h1>
  <div><<shortRound-based survival Roblox gameshort>><<img(src=git/thumbnail.jpeg(cap=A [[thumbnail]] for {{iSuper Bomb Survival}}.img>>{{b{{iSuper Bomb Survival}}}} is a game on [[Roblox]] developed by [[Polyhex|Polyhex (Roblox User)]]. The main [[goal]] of the [[game]] is to [[survive|Survival]] falling [[bombs|bomb]] until the round ends. You can buy skills (abilities that have a cooldown) and perks (abilities that are always active) using credits earned by surviving. In turn, skills and perks make it easier to survive, creating a [[positive feedback loop]].<<hrGameplayhr>><<img(src=git/score card.png(cap=A score card for a [[failed|Failure]] round.img>>Each round is 2 [[minutes|minute]] and 30 [[seconds|second]], and is given a random intensity score, which determines the difficulty of the round, alongside a map selected out of 3 choices during intermission. Survival time, intensity, and various other bonuses determine credits earned in a round, alongside credits grabbed off the ground. With hardcore enabled, you have less HP and all perks are locked, but you earn more credits per round.&pThere are a large number of bombs that can fall in a round, such as bombs that explode, bombs that make ground dangerous, bombs that chase after you, [[missiles|Missile]] that slowly travel toward the ground, bombs that look like fallen credits, and more. The types of bomb and quantity are determined by the intensity of a round.&pThere are also more modes, such as Big Server (25 players max), Super Intense (round intensity is always set to 5.0), and Randomizer (random skill/perk given each round).<<hrNon-gameplay contenthr>>Skills are bought through a [[lootbox]] system, where the user will get a random skill based on movement, offense, or defense. You can only have one active skill at a time. Perks are purchased like normal items in a [[shop]], and are thus not random. You can have up to two perks at a time, with the first slot being free and the second slot requiring [[Robux]]. There is also a [[premium currency]] called gems that can be purchased with Robux. Gems can be used to buy skills and perks, increase HP, increase credits earned, select the next round's map, increase/decrease the next round's intensity, packs (new skills, skill buffs), and gamepasses.&pYou are able to earn [[badges|Badge (Roblox)]] for a variety of things, such as time played, rounds won in a row, finding a hidden banana, picking up credits, and dying at the end of a round. You are able to display your badge on your [[nametag|Nametag (Roblox)]].&pThere are 11 stats that are kept track of:&spTime Played&spRounds Played&spRounds Won&spPizzas Eaten&spCredits Grabbed&spIntense Wins&spHardcore Wins&spTotal Score&spBest Streak&spChallenges Complete&sp6.0 Wins&pThe game has 5 toggleable [[binary]] options: one for music, one for hardcore mode, one for [[PvP|Player Versus Player]], one for screen shake, and one for [[AFK|Away From Keyboard]].</div>
