      <h1>Sweet Baby Gang</h1>
      <div>The Sweet Baby Gang (SBG) was a concept created by Matt Walsh of himself as a baby that has expanded to include a Twitter account, Spotify account, and merchandise from The Daily Wire.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/sweetbabygang(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://open.spotify.com/artist/1o6LnLgqIinvonVxNwTarP(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://store.dailywire.com/collections/matt-walsh/products/new-logo-sweet-baby-gang-tee(text=refCountref>> The most recognized feature of the SBG is the icon of Matt Walsh's adult head plastered on a baby's body, as well as Matt being known as "Sweet Daddy Walsh".<<ref(content=link|https://www.mediamatters.org/matt-walsh/sweet-daddy-walsh-and-sweet-baby-gang-matt-walshs-dirty-deal-diapers(text=refCountref>>
The Sweet Baby Gang originates from The Matt Walsh Show. The "Groveling To The Mob Won’t Stop It From Consuming You | Ep. 737" section "Slobs Are Canceled" shows a clip of actress Mo'Nique talking about how her "sisters" (who she also calls "sweet babies") were losing pride in themselves as she saw them wearing scarves and slippers in an airport.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaktFJQj8wQ(text=refCountref>> Matt Walsh responds by saying that he should soften his own takes by calling his own audience "sweet babies". In the following episode "Burger King And Nickelodeon Compete For Gold In The Woke Olympics | Ep. 738" in the section "Reading The Comments", Matt reads YouTube comments that describe the awkwardness of being called his "sweet babies", one of them stating that his fanbase is "officially known as the Sweet Baby Gang".<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nfA549rvvk(text=refCountref>> Matt jumps on the joke as a funny terminology to confuse outside viewers on a "if you know, you know" basis (often being compared to Fight Club, as the fan rule #1 of the SBG is no talking about the SBG).<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/dailywire/comments/1428h33/where_did_the_name_sweet_baby_gang_come_from/(text=refCountref>>
A song contest was held by The Daily Wire in the video on Matt Walsh's channel titled "Sweet Baby Gang Song Contest - The Finalists" where 5 finalists presented their songs to act as the anthem for the SBG.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at1a05rwZQ4(text=refCountref>> The panel of judges was Matt Walsh, Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, with Michael Knowles acting as the host. Out of the five, two songs were selected for an audience poll to decide if "Walsh's Anthem" or "Put 'Em Up If You're Down" would win. Walsh's Anthem was the song that won the contest, recognized as the official anthem of the Sweet Baby Gang.
The Sweet Baby Gang received merch put up on The Daily Wire Shop in the Matt Walsh Collection.<<ref(content=link|https://store.dailywire.com/collections/matt-walsh(text=refCountref>> This included apparel, and more notably, a stuffed animal of Matt Walsh as a baby called the "Sweet Baby Plushie". The strange nature of a plush baby only wearing a diaper with Matt's adult head on it has made the stuffed animal a subject of ridicule from opponents of Matt Walsh and The Daily Wire.
"Diaper Wrestling" is the name of the 2010 YouTube video from the channel MattandCrank, with Matt Walsh talking in the video as Crank acts as the cameraman.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAUKMbhT-4k(text=refCountref>> This is the same channel connected with the talk radio show that Matt co-hosted called The Matt and Crank Program that ran on WZBH (called 93.5 The Beach), showing that the video had direct involvement from Matt Walsh.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnAqtBYDQtk(text=refCountref>> The video has been misattributed as the origin of the Sweet Baby Gang, mainly due to the diapers worn in the video. The video starts by showing two men: "Intern A", wearing nothing but a diaper, and "Tater", sporting a diaper and shoes. The video shows Intern A and Tater wrestling, with Tater winning in the end. While the video has been used as a criticism of Matt (especially with a visible swastika tattoo on Tater's upper back), it is not directly affiliated with nor the inspiration of the Sweet Baby Gang.</div>
