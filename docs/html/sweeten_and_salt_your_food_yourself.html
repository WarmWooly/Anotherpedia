      <h1>Sweeten and salt your food yourself</h1>
      <div>"Sweeten and salt your food yourself" is the 34th rule in the book Food Rules: An Eater's Manual by Michael Pollan. The saying is used to convey that food prepared by company is added with more salt and sugar than what a normal person would add to the food. It precedes Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature and comes after Eat some foods that have been predigested by bacteria or fungi.</div>
