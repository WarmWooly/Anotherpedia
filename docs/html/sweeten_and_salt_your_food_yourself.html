  <div><<short34th rule in {{iFood Rules}}short>><<img(src=git/sweeten and salt.jpg(cap=A [[cook]] adding salt to a [[bowl]].img>>"{{bSweeten and salt your food yourself}}" is the 34th rule in the [[book]] {{i[[Food Rules: An Eater's Manual]]}} by [[Michael Pollan]]. The saying is used to convey that [[food]] prepared by [[companies|company]] is added with more [[salt]] and [[sugar]] than what a normal [[person]] would add to the food. It precedes {{i[[Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature]]}} and comes after {{i[[Eat some foods that have been predigested by bacteria or fungi]]}}.</div>
