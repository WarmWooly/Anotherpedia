      <h1>Taboo (game)</h1>
      <div>For the social norm, see taboo.<br>{{iTaboo}} is a board game where four or more players form two different teams with the goal to get the most cards.<br><br>The game comes with a pack of cards, a small hourglass, and a buzzer. Each team will have their teammates attempt to guess the word of the card that the describer must describe. Each card has one word to guess, and five words that the describer is not allowed to say. There will always be a monitor from the opposing team to make sure that the describer does not use a "taboo" word. If the describer skips a card or says one of the taboo words, the opposing team gets a card. If a teammate guesses the correct word, the describing team gets the card. If the timer runs out while the describer is holding a card, the card is put in the bottom of the pile.<br><br>After each round, the opposing teammate to the right of the describer becomes the new describer for the round.<br><br>The describer not only loses the card when skipping or saying a taboo word, but if the describer:;;Says a part of the word to guess|Uses a plural version of the word to guess or taboo words|Acts out the word to guess|Uses non-word sounds|Saying the phrase "sounds like"|Using an abbreviation;;</div>
