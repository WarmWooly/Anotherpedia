  <h1>Tangela</h1>
  <div>Tangela is a vine-covered grass type (pokémon) Pokémon (fictional species) from the Generation I (Pokémon).
Tangela is comprised of many tangle blue vines over some darkened, hidden interior. There's a small opening in its front for its two large eyes to peer through. Additionally, it has a pair of red shoe-shaped feet connected to its body by wrapped vines.&pTangela's official size is 3 foot (unit) and 3 inch, while weighing 77.2 pound. shiny (pokémon) Tangelas are lime green instead of blue.&pTangela is a portmanteau of tangle and some other trailing term, perhaps to just sound appealing.
Tangela's vines are described as seaweed-like with fine hairs, always growing and getting tangled on things it passes by. Its vines wiggle and sway constantly, unnerving and confusing combatants while causing a tickling sensation on contact. These vines are quite weak, allowing anything ensnared to easily free itself. The breaking of Tangela's vines is painless, growing back the following day. Its face has never been revealed. In Galar (Pokémon), its unique-scented vines are used as herb.
A Tangela has a 50/50 chance to be male or female. Tangela is the 114th Pokémon in the Pokédex (Pokémon) and has the Pokédex color blue.&pTangela can evolution (pokémon) into Tangrowth (Pokémon) when leveling up (Pokémon) with the move (Pokémon) Ancient Power (Pokémon).</div>
