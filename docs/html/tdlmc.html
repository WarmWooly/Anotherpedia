      <h1>TdLmc</h1>
      <div>TdLmc is a YouTuber, Twitch streamer, and the official Mobs Enhancement Addon God for the Minecraft total conversion mod Better Than Wolves. "TdL" in TdLmc stands for "The Dark Lizard", with "mc" meaning "Minecraft".

TdLmc has a variety of accounts. <<AsofJune 2025>>, these are the official TdLmc accounts:<br>;;YouTube - <<link(src=https://www.youtube.com/@TdLmcwastaken/videos(text=@TdLmcwastakenlink>> (146k subscribers)|Twitch (streaming) - <<link(src=https://www.twitch.tv/tdlmc(text=TdLmclink>> (22.9k followers)|Discord account - tdlmc|Discord server - <<link(src=discord.gg/Q7khmXh5q7(text=TdLmc's Basementlink>>|Instagram - <<link(src=https://www.instagram.com/tdlmcwastaken/(text=tdlmcwastakenlink>> (854 followers)|Twitter - <<link(src=https://x.com/TdLmc(text=@TdLmclink>> (166 followers);;

Starting with the oldest available video, TdLmc started creating videos on Ark: Survival Evolved on August 30, 2022. TdLmc would often play with Modding for Ark: Survival Evolved including those that added other elements from popular franchise, including Minecraft and Pokémon, and the hardcore mod Primal Fear (Ark: Survival Evolved). TdLmc would branch out to Sons of the Forest and Minecraft, Reviewing knock-offs for popular titles, and playing the Minecraft modpack RLCraft. TdLmc would branch away from Ark content and focus in on RLCraft, alongside playing other mod (Minecraft) including Cave Dweller (Minecraft mod), Minecraft Comes Alive, Pollution of the Realms, Physics Mod, and many others, before moving onto DawnCraft and Blood N Bones (Minecraft modpack). TdLmc would also get into making videos for Terraria. On October 20, 2023, TdLmc posted his first YouTube video on Better Than Wolves. Since then, all further uploads have been related to Better Than Wolves, and then the Mobs Enhancement Addon for BTW.

Terrance is a character created by TdLmc to represent a fictional video editor for TdLmc, often screaming "at him" mid-stream to add effects or remove parts of videos. A fan of TdLmc, Franzy14, has taken up the official mantle of roleplay as Terrance within TdL's Discord server.</div>
