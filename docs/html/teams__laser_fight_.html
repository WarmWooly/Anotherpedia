      <h1>Teams (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Teams is a coop in Laser Fight where players join into 2 teams of 8. Players spawning in will spawn in the red and blue spawning areas in the map. Players can't join the team with the most people (i.e. red with 3 and blue with 2 will force the player to join blue). Teammates can't be harmed by each other's bullets from guns or from streaks (such as Turret or Nuke).</div>
