  <h1>Teams (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>Teams is a coop (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) where players join into 2 teams of 8. Players spawning in will spawn in the red and blue spawning areas in the map (Laser Fight). Players can't join the team with the most people (i.e. red with 3 and blue with 2 will force the player to join blue). Teammates can't be harmed by each other's bullets from gun (Laser Fight) or from kill streak (Laser Fight) (such as Turret (Laser Fight) or Nuke (Laser Fight)).</div>
