  <h1>Technically correct</h1>
  <div>For the internet meme from {{aiFuturama, see You are technically correct, the best kind of correct.}}&spTechnically correct is a term used to describe when a statement is correct, but in a way that is unusual or unexpected. For example, while "finding" words in a word search by circling the words in the key is technically correct, as the person found the words on the page, it is not how a word search would normally be solved.</div>
