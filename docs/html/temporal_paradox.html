      <h1>Temporal paradox</h1>
      <div>A temporal paradox, also known as a time travel paradox or a time paradox, is a paradox or contradiction caused through time travel or other ability to see into the future. The bootstrap paradox is when time travel to the past is required for an event to occur (such as a person becoming a famous inventor because of something their future self gave them, which they would need to make a time machine). The grandfather paradox is when a time traveller changes the past, preventing the timeline in the first place (such as a time traveller killing their grandfather, making them never born, making them unable to travel back in time to kill their grandfather).</div>
