      <div><<shortParadoxes caused by time travelshort>><<img(src=git/time paradox.png(cap=The grandfather paradox.img>>A {{btemporal paradox}}, also known as a {{btime travel paradox}} or a {{btime paradox}}, is a [[paradox]] or [[contradiction]] caused through [[time travel]] or other ability to see into the [[future]]. The [[bootstrap paradox]] is when time travel to the past is required for an event to occur (such as a person becoming a famous [[inventor]] because of something their future self gave them, which they would need to make a [[time machine]]). The [[grandfather paradox]] is when a time traveller changes the past, preventing the [[timeline]] in the first place (such as a time traveller killing their [[grandfather]], making them never born, making them unable to travel back in time to kill their grandfather). </div>
