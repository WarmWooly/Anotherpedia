      <h1>Tendon</h1>
      <div>A tendon is a dense collagen connective tissue that connects muscles and bones, allowing control of the body. It expands and contracts based on the muscle to move the bones and also withstands tension that becomes present. Tendons are similar to ligaments (which connect bones to bones). In the adult body, there are over 4000 tendons.</div>
