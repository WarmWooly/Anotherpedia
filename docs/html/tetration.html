  <h1>Tetration</h1>
  <div>{{bTetration}}, also known as {{biterated exponentiation}}, is the act in Mathematics of iterating on an exponent, similar to how an exponent is iterated multiplication. To show tetration normally in math, you put a superscript before the Term (mathematics), unlike with an exponent, where you put the superscript after the term. Here is a simple example of tetration compared to exponentiation:As seen in the examples, tetration can get out of hand fast, leading to massive numbers over a short iteration. Pentation is the next level after tetration.</div>
