      <h1>Tetration</h1>
      <div>Tetration, also known as iterated exponentiation, is the act in math of iterating on an exponent, similar to how an exponent is iterated multiplication. To show tetration normally in math, you put a superscript before the term, unlike with an exponent, where you put the superscript after the term. Here is a simple example of tetration compared to exponentiation:3s-p3 = 3 * 3 * 3 = 3 * 9 = 27s-p33 = 3s-p3s-p3 = 3s-p27 = 7625597484987As seen in the examples, tetration can get out of hand fast, leading to massive numbers over a short iteration. Pentation is the next level after tetration.</div>
