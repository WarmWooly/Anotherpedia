  <h1>Tetration</h1>
  <div><<shortIteration of an exponentshort>><<img(src=git/tetration.png(cap=A [[graph]] representing tetration.(brightImgimg>>{{bTetration}}, also known as {{biterated exponentiation}}, is the act in [[math|Mathematics]] of iterating on an [[exponent]], similar to how an exponent is iterated [[multiplication]]. To show tetration normally in math, you put a [[superscript]] before the [[term|Term (mathematics)]], unlike with an exponent, where you put the superscript after the term. Here is a simple example of tetration compared to exponentiation:<<quo3{{s-p3}} = 3 * 3 * 3 = 3 * 9 = 27quo>><<quo{{s-p3}}3 = 3{{s-p3{{s-p3}}}} = 3{{s-p27}} = 7625597484987quo>>As seen in the examples, tetration can get out of hand fast, leading to massive numbers over a short iteration. [[Pentation]] is the next level after tetration.</div>
