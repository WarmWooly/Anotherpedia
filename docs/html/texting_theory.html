      <h1>Texting theory</h1>
      <div>For the subreddit, see r/TextingTheory.&spTexting theory is the analysis of text messages or DMs using Chess.com's annotation symbols, especially on dating apps. Through analysis of the messages, people who date online through text can improve their pick-up lines, avoid difficult situations or stalling out the conversation (aka stalemate), and increase the likelihood of getting a date. Other conversations, such as with loved ones, family members, or other close people, can also be analyzed. The most notable sources for texting theory is the subreddit r/TextingTheory and the YouTubers Text Chess and Manik Chess.</div>
