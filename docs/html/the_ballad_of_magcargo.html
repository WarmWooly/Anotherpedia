      <h1>The Ballad of Magcargo</h1>
      <div>"The Ballad of Magcargo" is a folk ballad by Brian Hull uploaded to his YouTube channel Brian Hull Plus on March 6, 2024. The song is about a video where Brian finds his favorite Pokémon using the Favorite Pokémon Picker, with Magcargo going much further than expected.

Come, my friends, and I'll tell you the tale<br>Of a great and mighty fire snail<br>On a quest to find his favorite mons,<br>Brian looked through every Pokémon<br>He looked and looked, and so it went on<br>As he went through every Pokémon<br>He picked the ones who caught his eye<br>'Til he saw this little guy<br><br>It was the fire lava snail, Magcargo, Magcargo<br>He thought Brian would never bail, Magcargo, Magcargo<br><br>Brain bravely continued his quest,<br>Picking mons he saw above the rest<br>In the highest of ranks did Magcargo stay<br>'Til Brian's mind started to sway<br>Carracosta, Great Tusk, and Flygon too<br>Saw Magcargo's heart begin to turn blue<br>Brian left Magcargo behind in the dust<br>Hopefully fire snail tears do not rust<br><br>He left the fire lava snail, Magcargo, Magcargo<br>No one'd ever thought he'd get so far, Magcargo, Magcargo<br><br>The snail watched onward as he wept<br>Thinking this competition he could have swept<br>He fought so long and he fought so hard<br>Only to be beat by Charizard</div>
