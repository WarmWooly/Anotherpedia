      <div>"The Glep Ep" is the 8th episode of the Smiling Friends (season 3) of Smiling Friends, which was released on November 30, 2025. It was writing by Michael Cusack and Zach Hadel, storyboard by Hannah Daigle, and directing by David Hootselle. Mr. Boss (Smiling Friends) asks Glep (Smiling Friends) what he actually does at Smiling Friends Inc. (Smiling Friends), causing Glep to quit in frustration.

Mr. Boss does an annual review of his employee during the holiday season, praising Pim (Smiling Friends), Charlie (Smiling Friends), and Allan (Smiling Friends), before trying to talk to Glep. They all question what he actually does at the company, causing Mr. Boss to directly confront Glep. Glep breaks his iPad and storms off in frustration, quitting on the way out. Mr. Boss proceeds to fire Glep immediately after. Glep drives home in a sports car to his mansion. His wife, Marge Simpson (Smiling Friends), distraught at how much time Glep is staying at work, decides to visit her relatives for the holidays. Glep tries to watch Television, before heading out to a bar (establishment).<br><br>At the bar, the bartender asks for his personal identification. He reads Glep's driver's license and notices that he was born in 329 Anno Domini, asking him what he's seen. Glep reminisce about his past, including in Rome at 476 A.D., where his dancing caused the Roman emperor to suicide, England in 1347 A.D., where he started the bubonic plague,  and Virginia in 1777 A.D., where he kill the mood in a casual gathering with the Founding Fathers of the United States. A bar patron berates Glep for starting the bubonic plague, before having the rest of the bar members pray for the victims of the plague.<br><br>Glep is dropped off at a bus stop by Smiling Friends Inc., before fading to a flashback in 1992, when Glep first arrived in Pennsylvania. He encountered Mr. Boss, ruined from a market crash (most likely Black Wednesday), who prepares to Suicide by gun unless Glep can give him a reason not to do it. Glep dances, causing Mr. Boss to smile. Mr. Boss then comes up with the idea to start a business about making people smile, which Glep agrees to. In the present, Glep returns to the office to find it in disarray. Mr. Boss and Glep make up, and Glep rejoins the company. The employees and some of their families dine together, with Marge returning with a foreign dish. In the end, a narrator makes a racist joke, ruining the vibe.</div>
