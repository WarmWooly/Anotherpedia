      <h1>The Moon (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>The Moon (XVIII) is a Tarot Card in Balatro based on The Moon Major Arcana tarot card. When used, it converts up to three selected playing cards into the &clubSuit Club Suit, even if the selected card is already a &clubSuit Club. The Moon does not affect the Rank or any Enhancements made on the card. The Roman numeral XVIII on the card equates to 18. The Moon has three other variations for the other Suits: The Star (&diamondSuit Diamonds), The Sun (&heartSuit Hearts), and The World (&spadeSuit Spades).</div>
