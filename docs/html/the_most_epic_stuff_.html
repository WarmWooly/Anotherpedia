This list included 4 [[cars|car]], 3 [[shoes|shoe]], 4 [[NBA|National Basketball Association]] [[players|Basketball player]], and 3 breeds of [[dogs|dog]]. I can attest that these things are pretty epic.&pUnfortunately, the tabs HOME, Shoes, NBA Players, and Dogs only led back to the main page, with the tab "Vehicles" in a slightly darker color going to a broken link.<<hrLegacy hosting removal and shutdownhr>>{{tMain page: [[Replit's removal of legacy hosting]]}}&spOn January 3rd, Replit changed how hosting worked on its platform, removing the support for legacy hosting. After this change, the website was replaced with a message stating the "Replit Legacy Hosting has migrated to Deployments". Since then, the site can no longer be reached.</div>
