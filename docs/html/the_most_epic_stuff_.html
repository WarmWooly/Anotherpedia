      <h1>The Most Epic Stuff!</h1>
      <div>The Most Epic Stuff!, also known as html-final-project-1, was a website that was developed by epicroblocgamer on Replit with the URL <<link(src=https://html-final-project-1--epicroblocgamer.repl.co/index.html(text=html-final-project-1--epicroblocgamer.repl.colink>>.<br><br>This webpage was an opinion by epic, showing what things that epic thinks are the most epic. This list included 4 cars, 3 shoes, 4 NBA players, and 3 breeds of dogs. I can attest that these things are pretty epic.<br><br>Unfortunately, the tabs HOME, Shoes, NBA Players, and Dogs only led back to the main page, with the tab "Vehicles" in a slightly darker color going to a broken link.

Main page: Replit's removal of legacy hosting<br>On January 3rd, Replit changed how hosting worked on its platform, removing the support for legacy hosting. After this change, the website was replaced with a message stating the "Replit Legacy Hosting has migrated to Deployments". Since then, the site can no longer be reached.</div>
