  <h1>The Most Epic Stuff!</h1>
  <div>The Most Epic Stuff!, also known as html-final-project-1, was a website that was developed by Epicroblocgamer (Replit) on Replit with the URL <<link(src=https://html-final-project-1--epicroblocgamer.repl.co/index.html(text=html-final-project-1--epicroblocgamer.repl.colink>>.&pThis webpage was an opinion by epic, showing what Thing that epic thinks are the most epic. This list included 4 car, 3 shoe, 4 National Basketball Association Basketball player, and 3 breeds of dog. I can attest that these things are pretty epic.&pUnfortunately, the tabs HOME, Shoes, NBA Players, and Dogs only led back to the main page, with the tab "Vehicles" in a slightly darker color going to a broken link.
Main page: Replit's removal of legacy hosting&spOn January 3rd, Replit changed how hosting worked on its platform, removing the support for legacy hosting. After this change, the website was replaced with a message stating the "Replit Legacy Hosting has migrated to Deployments". Since then, the site can no longer be reached.</div>
