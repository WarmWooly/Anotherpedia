      <h1>The Star (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>The Star (XVII) is a Tarot Card in Balatro based on The Star Major Arcana tarot card. When used, it converts up to three selected playing cards into the &diamondSuit Diamond Suit, even if the selected card is already a &diamondSuit Diamond. The Star does not affect the Rank or any Enhancements made on the card. The Roman numeral XVII on the card equates to 17. The Star has three other variations for the other Suits: The Moon (&clubSuit Clubs), The Sun (&heartSuit Hearts), and The World (&spadeSuit Spades).</div>
