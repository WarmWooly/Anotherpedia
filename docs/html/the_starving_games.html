Kantmiss Evershot (Maiara Walsh) lives in District 12 of Panem (a dystopian version of the United States), an impoverished area of the country. After connecting with Dale (Brant Daugherty), the "Starving Games" drawing is called, with Kantmiss comforting her sister Petunia (Kennedy Hermansen). President Snowballs (Diedrich Bader) explains how corporate greed caused rioting in cities, so when he took power, he separated the country into districts to prevent this from happening again at the cost of a democracy. He announces how the "Starving Games" are a televised murder sport and that the winner will get an old ham, a coupon for Subway, and a partially-eaten pickle for winning. After a few joke selections are read by Effoff (Lauren Bowles), Petunia gets called in the random selection. Kantmiss reluctantly volunteers, with Peter Malarkey (Cody Christian) volunteering afterwards.&pKantmiss and Peter are bussed off, as it cuts to Snowballs talking to the game coordinator Seleca (Dean West) telling him to ensure the victor isn't from a poor district. Stanley Ceaserman (Chris Marroy) acts as the game host, introducing the audience to the contestants, including Peter and Kantmiss. The games begin, with Kantmiss struggling to get a backpack before running into the forest. Once Kantmiss makes it to the edge of the arena, Seleca launches fireballs, Red from Angry Birds, and fruits at her to get her back towards the combat. She climbs a tree to evade a group of well-armed contestants, including Peter, who wait for her to be forced to leave. Rudy (Eryn Davis), also hiding in a tree, signals Kantmiss to drop a beehive on top of the contestants below. Despite getting severely stung and hallucinating herself as a Na'vi from Avatar, Rudy gets Kantmiss to snap out before inspiring her. Kantmiss single-handedly takes out five contestants and Psy dancing to "Gangnam Style", but Rudy is killed by Marco (Ross Wyngaarden) in the process.&pIn District 12, sparks of revolting nearly ignite to be put out by a food advertisement. Snowballs tells Seleca to get a love story going, who changes the rules so two people of different genders can win instead of one (with Kantmiss being the only female remaining). She reluctantly searches for Peter to team up, but she finds out that Peter was injured after waxing his back. Kantmiss aids Peter's infection and fever, with the duo learning that increasingly explicit actions lead to better gifts dropped by Seleca. Dale, outraged that Kantmiss hooked up with Peter for his survival, enters the arena. Kantmiss and Marco face off before standing down to several action movie characters holding large guns. Dale comes up from behind and dispatches them before arguing with Kantmiss, where he ultimately leaves the arena. Kantmiss kills Marco, and Seleca changes the rules to only allow one winner. Peter suggests that they both commit suicide to show that the Capital can't control them, with Kantmiss shooting him in the back. Nick Fury (Gralen Bryant Banks) invites Kantmiss into The Avengers before the whole team blows up.</div>
