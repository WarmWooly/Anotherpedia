      <h1>The Sun (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>The Sun (XIX) is a Tarot Card in Balatro based on The Sun Major Arcana tarot card. When used, it converts up to three selected playing cards into the &heartSuit Heart Suit, even if the selected card is already a &heartSuit Heart. The Moon does not affect the Rank or any Enhancements made on the card. The Roman numeral XIX on the card equates to 19. The Sun has three other variations for the other Suits: The Star (&diamondSuit Diamonds), The Moon (&clubSuit Clubs), and The World (&spadeSuit Spades).</div>
