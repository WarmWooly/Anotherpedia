      <h1>The World (Balatro)</h1>
      <div>The World (XXI) is a Tarot Card in Balatro based on The World Major Arcana tarot card. When used, it converts up to three selected playing cards into the &spadeSuit Spade Suit, even if the selected card is already a &spadeSuit Spade. The World does not affect the Rank or any Enhancements made on the card. The Roman numeral XXI on the card equates to 21. The World has three other variations for the other Suits: The Star (&diamondSuit Diamonds), The Moon (&clubSuit Clubs), and The Sun (&heartSuit Hearts).</div>
