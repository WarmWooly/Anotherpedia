      <h1>Thesaurus.plus pigeons</h1>
      <div>The Thesaurus.plus pigeons are template images used by Thesaurus.plus, an online thesaurus, of a pair of pigeons talking to each other, with the left pigeon asking about synonyms/antonyms of a word, with the other responding with examples. For synonyms, the left pigeon wears a green baseball cap while asking "what are other words for _____?", with the right pigeon, wearing glasses, a graduate cap with a green tassel, and sandwich bread crust, responding with examples in the form of: "_____, _____, _____". For antonyms, the left pigeon has a red baseball cap while asking "what's the opposite of _____?", with the right pigeon dressed and responding in the same manner as for synonyms.</div>
