      <h1>Thomas Edison</h1>
      <div>Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor who is well-known for his inventions of the phonograph and the incandescent light bulb. He was born on February 11, 1847 in Ohio, but then lived his childhood in Michigan.&pAs a teenager, he sold newspapers, candy, and vegetables to people going on trains, saving up for equipment for his experiments. He even created his own paper, Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with the rest of his papers. He later moved to Louisville, Kentucky to work for Western Union when he was 19, where in 1867 he was fired for spilling sulfiric acid from a lead-acid battery, which went through the floor onto the desk of his boss.&pOn June 1, 1869, Thomas Edison made his first patent for an electric vote recorder (U.S. Patent 90646).&pOn October 18, 1931, Edison died at the age of 84.</div>
