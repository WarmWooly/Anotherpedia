      <h1>Thunderdome</h1>
      <div>The Thunderdome refers to the metal cage in Mad Mad Beyond Thunderdome in Bartertown used as entertainment for the population, where  two combatants fight to the death in the cage. There is only one rule in the Thunderdome (as stated by Dr. Dealgood):Weapons of creative variety are littered around the dome, with combatants attached to bungee cables for enhanced mobility and to get higher in the dome to get increasingly better weapons. The Thunderdome's main purpose is to keep peace within Bartertown by giving a "civil" way to dispute.</div>
