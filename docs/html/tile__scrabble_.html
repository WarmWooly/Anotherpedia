      <h1>Tile (Scrabble)</h1>
      <div>This page only gives a general overview of a {{aiScrabble tile. For rules on placement and scoring, see aiScrabble rules.}}<br>A tile in Scrabble is a square piece with a letter and a point (scrabble), besides blank tiles, which as implied, are left blank. These can be placed onto the board (scrabble) to form word (scrabble), which are used to score points.

Tiles are often made of wood and plastic, using a black ink to designate the type of piece. Other material, such as metal, have been used as well, if not more uncommon. When made of wood or plastic, the coloring leans towards being tan. The pieces are much more thin relative to their length and width, making them easy to stack and store. The edges are often sharp, but some have rounded corners.

Due to the popularity of Scrabble, and the versatility of the tiles, the Scrabble tile has become a decoration, often mounted onto walls. These decorative tiles may or may not include point values, punctuation, and emoji.

The most prominent usage of the tiles as decoration is when mounted onto a wall. They may be accompanied by other wall decoration, such as framed photograph and sign (decoration). Most usage includes crossing the words like in the game, where name and words including family, love, and home are most often displayed.<br><br>The colors are often not limited to a single choice due to the new decorative nature given to these tiles. Grey, black, and dulled primary color are utilized to give more vibrancy to many of these arrangements. These tiles are almost exclusively made of wood or other similar-looking materials.

Normal-sized tiles have multiple uses in jewelry. pendant and necklace may use one or multiple tiles. Elastic bracelet are also often used in conjunction with the tiles. Besides character (linguistics), art is also predominantly featured. earring, despite being limited, do also exist. 

Normal-sized tiles can be glue or otherwise be stuck in a word or message and hung with string or twine to make Christmas ornament. ribbon are also predominantly featured, either as a way to hold the tiles into place or just as another part of the ornament. Tiles can be added onto other ornaments or festive decorations, including wreath and signs. There are several arrangements used for the ornaments, most often being a single column top-to-bottom, followed by a tree-like pattern, and rarely as a single row. Merry, snow, hope, and other festive words are utilized whenever a name isn't being used as the content.</div>
