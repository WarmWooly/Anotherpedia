These can be placed onto the [[board|board (scrabble)]] to form [[words|word (scrabble)]], which are used to score points.<<hrConstructionhr>>Tiles are often made of [[wood]] and [[plastic]], using a black [[ink]] to designate the type of piece. Other [[materials|material]], such as [[metals|metal]], have been used as well, if not more uncommon. When made of wood or plastic, the coloring leans towards being tan. The pieces are much more thin relative to their length and width, making them easy to stack and store. The edges are often sharp, but some have rounded corners.<<hrDecorationhr>><<img(src=git/scrabble tile decoration.jpg(cap=A set of names (Brian, Kassidy, Michel, and Lennie) as a wall decoration.img>>Due to the popularity of {{iScrabble}}, and the versatility of the tiles, the {{iScrabble}} tile has become a [[decoration]], often mounted onto walls. These decorative tiles may or may not include point values, [[punctuation]], and [[emojis|emoji]].<<hr2Wall decorhr2>>The most prominent usage of the tiles as decoration is when mounted onto a wall. They may be accompanied by other [[decorations|wall decoration]], such as framed [[photographs|photograph]] and [[signs|sign (decoration)]]. Most usage includes crossing the words like in the game, where [[names|name]] and words including {{ifamily}}, {{ilove}}, and {{ihome}} are most often displayed.&pThe colors are often not limited to a single choice due to the new decorative nature given to these tiles. Grey, black, and dulled [[primary colors|primary color]] are utilized to give more vibrancy to many of these arrangements. These tiles are almost exclusively made of wood or other similar-looking materials.<<hr2Jewelryhr2>>Normal-sized tiles have multiple uses in jewelry. [[Pendants|pendant]] and [[necklaces|necklace]] may use one or multiple tiles. Elastic [[bracelets|bracelet]] are also often used in conjunction with the tiles.

[[Earrings|earring]], despite being limited, do also exist. <<hr2Christmas ornamentshr2>><<img(src=git/scrabble tile ornament.jpg(cap=Several ornaments made of tiles.img>>Normal-sized tiles can be [[glued|glue]] or otherwise be stuck in a word or message and hung with [[string]] or [[twine]] to make [[Christmas]] [[ornaments|ornament]]. [[Ribbons|ribbon]] are also predominantly featured, either as a way to hold the tiles into place or just as another part of the ornament. Tiles can be added onto other ornaments or festive decorations, including [[wreaths|wreath]] and signs. There are several arrangements used for the ornaments, most often being a single column top-to-bottom, followed by a tree-like pattern, and rarely as a single row. {{iMerry}}, {{isnow}}, {{ihope}}, and other festive words are utilized whenever a name isn't being used as the content.</div>
