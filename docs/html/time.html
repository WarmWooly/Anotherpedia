      <h1>Time</h1>
      <div>Time is the unidirectional movement that is unable to be Reversal. The current position of time is known as the present.<br><br>Time is considered highly Value, especially to Human. This is because of the fact that life will Death at some point due to entropy increasing with time, which also spells the end of all life Future. As noted in the second law of thermodynamics:"Any spontaneously occurring process will always lead to an escalation in the entropy of the universe."Under general relativity, time is relative, which contrasts with time in quantum mechanics, which is moving at a constant rate. This is known as the problem of time.</div>
