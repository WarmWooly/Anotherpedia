      <h1>Time</h1>
      <div>Time is the unidirectional movement that is unable to be reversed. The current position of time is known as the present.&pTime is considered highly valuable, especially to humans. This is because of the fact that life will end at some point due to entropy increasing with time, which also spells the end of all life eventually. As noted in the second law of thermodynamics:Under general relativity, time is relative, which contrasts with time in quantum mechanics, which is moving at a constant rate. This is known as the problem of time.</div>
