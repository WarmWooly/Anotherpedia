      <h1>Time</h1>
      <div><<shortMovement of the universeshort>><<img(src=git/time.png(cap=A [[clipart]] of a [[clock]].(brightImgimg>>{{bTime}} is the unidirectional movement that is unable to be [[reversed|Reversal]]. The current [[position]] of time is known as the [[present]].&pTime is considered highly [[valuable|Value]], especially to [[humans|Human]]. This is because of the fact that [[life]] will [[end|Death]] at some point due to [[entropy]] increasing with time, which also spells the end of all life [[eventually|Future]]. As noted in the [[second law of thermodynamics]]:<<quo"Any spontaneously occurring [[process]] will always lead to an [[escalation]] in the entropy of the [[universe]]."quo>>Under [[general relativity]], time is [[relative]], which contrasts with time in [[quantum mechanics]], which is moving at a constant rate. This is known as the [[problem of time]].</div>
