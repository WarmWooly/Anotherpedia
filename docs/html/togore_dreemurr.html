  <h1>Togore Dreemurr</h1>
  <div><<shortMetafictional {{iUndertale}} charactershort>><<img(src=git/togore dreemurr.png(cap=Togore Dreemurr.img>>{{bTogore Dreemurr}}, also called {{bTogore}} and {{bToe gore}}, is a [[metafictional|metafiction]] [[character]] based on {{i[[Undertale's|Undertale]]}} characters [[Asgore|Asgore Dreemurr]], [[Toriel|Toriel Dreemurr]], and [[Asriel Dreemurr]]. Asriel, the son of Asgore and Toriel, has parts of his name from both his parents. The name "Togore" is similarly derived, despite being considered more unpleasant than Asriel. While the idea of Togore has been around since 2015, its best-known appearance came in later, with the sprite allegedly made by <<link(src=https://x.com/Chapsti99794854(text=@Chapsti99794854link>> on [[Twitter]] for the [[Roblox]] game {{iChecho's Deltarune RP}}.<<ref(content=link|https://x.com/Chapsti99794854/status/1949809879851434013(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.roblox.com/games/2872154782/Chechos-Deltarune-RP(text=refCountref>> The sprite would then be used for a [[TikTok]] by <<link(src=https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnygx4(text=@sunnygx4link>> on July 26, 2025, where the [[lore]] of Togore being the middle child of Asriel and [[Chara|Chara (Undertale)]] would be made.<<ref(content=link|https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnygx4/video/7531284294824758542(text=refCountref>> Togore's unsettling appearance and name makes the character stand out, similar to [[Graggle Simpson]] to {{i[[The Simpsons]]}}.</div>
