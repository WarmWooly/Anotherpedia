      <h1>Togore Dreemurr</h1>
      <div>Togore Dreemurr, also called Togore and Toe gore, is a metafictional character based on Undertale's characters Asgore, Toriel, and Asriel Dreemurr. Asriel, the son of Asgore and Toriel, has parts of his name from both his parents. The name "Togore" is similarly derived, despite being considered more unpleasant than Asriel. While the idea of Togore has been around since 2015, its best-known appearance came in later, with the sprite allegedly made by <<link(src=https://x.com/Chapsti99794854(text=@Chapsti99794854link>> on Twitter for the Roblox game Checho's Deltarune RP. The sprite would then be used for a TikTok by <<link(src=https://www.tiktok.com/@sunnygx4(text=@sunnygx4link>> on July 26, 2025, where the lore of Togore being the middle child of Asriel and Chara would be made. Togore's unsettling appearance and name makes the character stand out, similar to Graggle Simpson to The Simpsons.</div>
