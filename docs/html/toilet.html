      <h1>Toilet</h1>
      <div>A toilet is an installation used for the collection of human waste, often referring to the water-using flush toilets. Toilets can also forgo the use of water in the form of dry toilets. The more popular form of toilet is a sitting toilet with a toilet seat for sitting, but there is also a large population who squat using squatting toilets. Toilets are connected to a sewer system, septic tank, or other storage. Water used in a toilet becomes blackwater, which is then removed and cleaned. Toilets made only for urination are known as urinals. Modern toilets are most often made of porcelain (hence the term "porcelain throne"), but concrete, plastic, metal, and wood can also be used for toilet fixtures. Toilets are most often located in buildings in the form of bathrooms or in separate outhouses, which also typically contain toilet paper.</div>
