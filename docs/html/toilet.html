  <h1>Toilet</h1>
  <div>A toilet is an installation used for the collection of human waste, often referring to the water-using flush toilet. Toilets can also forgo the use of water in the form of dry toilet. The more popular form of toilet is a sitting toilet with a toilet seat for sitting, but there is also a large population who squat using squatting toilet. Toilets are connected to a sewer system, septic tank, or other waste storage. Water used in a toilet becomes blackwater (waste), which is then removed and water sanitation. Toilets made only for urination are known as urinal. Modern toilets are most often made of porcelain (hence the term "porcelain throne"), but concrete, plastic, metal, and wood can also be used for toilet fixtures. Toilets are most often located in building in the form of bathroom or in separate outhouse, which also typically contain toilet paper.</div>
