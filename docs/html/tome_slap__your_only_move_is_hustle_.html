      <div><<info|||Stats||Damage|800||Startup|5 frames||Active|3 frames||Move duration|12 frames||Blocking|High (+1 advantage)<br>Low (+3 advantage)||Parryable|Yes (High; frame 5)||Frame advantage|17 frames||Freeable|Yes||Flippable|Yesinfo>>Tome Slap is a Wizard-exclusive grounded Attack move in Your Only Move Is HUSTLE. Tome Slap is Wizard's jab, dealing significant damage at the cost of being slower than every other character's jab. Wizard pulls out their tome and swings it towards the opponent, slapping them while slightly moving forward. Tome Slap is great for close-range mixups against longer attacks compared to Dash Back, Jump, and Block. However, if the opponent predicts a Tome Slap, they can easily Grab, Block, jab, or even Burst to counter it. Tome Slap is also solid for combos to either bait out a Burst or punish someone who has no Burst. Tome Slap can be used multiple times before the opponent is sent flying, but the opponent can easily DI away from the first slap or Burst to prevent this.</div>
