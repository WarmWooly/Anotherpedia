Tome Slap is Wizard's jab, dealing significant damage at the cost of being slower than every other character's jab. Wizard pulls out their tome and swings it towards the opponent, slapping them while slightly moving forward. Tome Slap is great for close-range mixups against longer attacks compared to Dash Back (YOMIH), Jump (YOMIH), and Block (YOMIH). However, if the opponent predicts a Tome Slap, they can easily Grab (YOMIH), Block, jab, or even Burst (YOMIH) to counter it. Tome Slap is also solid for Combo (YOMIH) to either bait out a Burst or punish someone who has no Burst. Tome Slap can be used multiple times before the opponent is sent flying, but the opponent can easily Directional Influence (YOMIH) away from the first slap or Burst to prevent this.</div>
