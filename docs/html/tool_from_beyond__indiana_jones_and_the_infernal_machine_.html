      <h1>Tool from Beyond (Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine)</h1>
      <div>The Tool from Beyond is an artifact found by the fictional archeologist Indiana Jones in 1947 during the events of the game Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine.

In the game, the player uses this part of the Infernal Machine to open up membrane separating slices of ordinary reality from the Aetherium. In these slices of ordinary reality, the player can find useful items such as trauma kits and a large mirror. Later in the game, the player uses this tool to open up membrane leading to Babylon that bleed into the Aetherium allowing you to separate Marduk from Sophia and escape from the Aetherium before it collapses.

In the lore, this machine part is said to be used to receive the inbound connection from the Infernal Machine in Babylon. This machine part was something that Marduk had attempted to keep safe in the Aetherium, most likely to prevent overuse, which, as seen in-game, causes ordinary reality to bleed into the Aetherium and eventually collapse it due to destabilization. This is the only machine part to be kept by Indiana Jones after escaping the Aetherium, as the other 4 were lost due to the self-destruction of the Infernal Machine.</div>
