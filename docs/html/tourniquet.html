      <h1>Tourniquet</h1>
      <div><<nomedical>>For other terms relating to tourniquet, see tourniquet (disambiguation).<br>A tourniquet is a medical device used to cut off Hemodynamics of a limb (anatomy) using pressure with a wrap element and a tighten element (such as cloth and a stick). The wrapping element surrounds the target limb, with the tightening element twist to increase the pressure applied. Tourniquets are used in immediate medical emergency, surgery, and rehabilitation. While makeshift tourniquets can be constructed, dedicated professional devices are safety and more effective, with makeshift tourniquets potentially causing soft tissue injury, increased pain, and additional injury. Misuse of a tourniquet can cause bodily harm without medical training.</div>
