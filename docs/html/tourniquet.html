      <h1>Tourniquet</h1>
      <div><<nomedical>>For other terms relating to tourniquet, see tourniquet (disambiguation).&spA tourniquet is a medical device used to cut off blood flow of a limb using pressure with a wrapping element and a tightening element (such as cloth and a stick). The wrapping element surrounds the target limb, with the tightening element twisted to increase the pressure applied. Tourniquets are used in immediate emergencies, surgery, and rehabilitation. While makeshift tourniquets can be constructed, dedicated professional devices are safer and more effective, with makeshift tourniquets potentially causing tissue damage, increased pain, and additional injuries. Misuse of a tourniquet can cause bodily harm without training.</div>
