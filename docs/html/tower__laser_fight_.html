      <h1>Tower (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Office is a large outdoor map in Laser Fight focused on complex movement. Players spawn on one of the colored platforms along the sides of the map, connecting to a platform with a ramp. Bridges lead to the corner towers and the central tower in the middle. While the corner towers are much simpler, they are also very exposed. Guns will tend to spawn on or near the center tower. The center tower is comprised of multiple levels with various platforms, ladders, and barriers. Players who fall down the tower are likely to ragdoll from fall damage, making it riskier to scale to the top where the best selection of guns are.
The void covering the bottom of the map is lethal, killing players on contact. The badge Long Way Down is awarded through dying this way. The death screen will say, "The Void killed you!", and one of the following death messages will appear in the feed:;;X fell out of the world|X had a long way down|X was consumed by the void|X was lost in the abyss|X went missing|X fell into the river of Lego City|X wasn't rescued by Lakitu|X plunged into the darkness;;</div>
