Players spawn on one of the colored platforms along the sides of the map, connecting to a platform with a ramp. Bridges lead to the corner towers and the central tower in the middle. While the corner towers are much simpler, they are also very exposed. gun (Laser Fight) will tend to gun spawning (Laser Fight) on or near the center tower. The center tower is comprised of multiple levels with various platforms, ladders, and barriers. Players who fall down the tower are likely to ragdoll from fall damage (Laser Fight), making it riskier to scale to the top where the best selection of guns are.
