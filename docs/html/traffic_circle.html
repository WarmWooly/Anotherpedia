      <h1>Traffic circle</h1>
      <div>A traffic circle is a round intersection with an island in the center. Depending on the location, there may be a stop sign, a yield sign, or even no sign at all. Most traffic circles have four entrances and exits.<br><br>In the USA, drivers enter and go counterclockwise around the traffic circle. The outside lane is allowed to exit at any point, while the inside lane must merge to the outside lane before exiting.<br><br>Traffic circles are much less safe than roundabouts due to the ability to get t-boned and how many traffic circles require you to quickly speed onto it. They are usually made for appeal and not for efficiency.</div>
