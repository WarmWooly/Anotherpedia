  <h1>Tragedy (event)</h1>
  <div>A tragedy is an event that causes great suffering, destruction, loss, and/or death. It is tragic when a tragedy occurs. Serious accident, catastrophe (including natural disaster), and acts of crime or terrorism can be tragedies. The scale for an event to become a tragedy is blurry, especially depending on the context, which can be dependent on personal relationship to those affected, the location of the event, its publicity, and the immediate consequence and long-term effect impact of the event.</div>
