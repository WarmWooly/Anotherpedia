      <h1>Tragedy (event)</h1>
      <div>A tragedy is an event that causes great suffering, destruction, loss, and/or death. It is tragic when a tragedy occurs. Serious accidents, catastrophes (including natural disasters), and acts of crime or terrorism can be tragedies. The scale for an event to become a tragedy is blurry, especially depending on the context, which can be dependent on relationships to those affected, the location of the event, its publicity, and the immediate and long-term impact of the event.</div>
