      <h1>Transceiver</h1>
      <div>A transceiver is a combination of a transmitter and receiver, with its name deriving from both electronic devices. It is able to transmit and receive data, which is often sent wirelessly. It can also be used to refer to optical fiber. Transceivers started to appear in radio technologies during the 1920s, where before a transmitter and receiver needed to be made separately. The Federal Communications Commission monitors assembly and usage of these devices.</div>
