  <h1>Transformation (mathematics)</h1>
  <div>Transformation in mathematics is the generalization of the four different ways to manipulate an object in 2nd Dimensional Objects. The transformation consists of these different changes:
Translation relates to the movement of the entire object from point A to point B. A translation of (1, 1) (one unit up and one unit to the right) on a point (geometry) in the location of (7, 7) would then have the image located in (8, 8).
Rotation relates to the movement of an object oriented around a single point. If the point (7, 7) was oriented 90 degree (angle) clockwise around the origin (mathematics) (0, 0), the image would be located on (7, -7).
Reflection relates to the flipping of an object across an axis. A reflection on x = 0 would have point (7, 7) be flipped across the x-axis on the origin, leading the image to be (-7, 7).
Also known as enlargement, dilation relates to a change in the size of an object. A line segment of points (-7, 7) and (7, 7) enlarged to double its size relative to the origin (0, 0) would have the image consist of (-14, 14) and (14, 14).</div>
