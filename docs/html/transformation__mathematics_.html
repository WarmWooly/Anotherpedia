  <h1>Transformation (mathematics)</h1>
  <div><<shortMathematical object manipulationshort>><<img(src=git/transformations.png(cap=A [[diagram]] depicting the four transformations.img>>{{bTransformation}} in [[mathematics]] is the generalization of the four different ways to manipulate an [[object]] in [[2D space|2nd Dimensional Objects]]. The transformation consists of these different changes:<<hr2Translationhr2>>Translation relates to the movement of the entire object from point A to point B. A translation of (1, 1) (one [[unit]] up and one unit to the right) on a [[point|point (geometry)]] in the [[location]] of (7, 7) would then have the image located in (8, 8).<<hr2Rotationhr2>>Rotation relates to the movement of an object oriented around a single point. If the point (7, 7) was oriented 90 [[degrees|degree (angle)]] [[clockwise]] around the [[origin|origin (mathematics)]] (0, 0), the image would be located on (7, -7).<<hr2Reflectionhr2>>Reflection relates to the flipping of an object across an [[axis]]. A reflection on x = 0 would have point (7, 7) be flipped across the x-axis on the origin, leading the image to be (-7, 7).<<hr2Dilationhr2>>Also known as enlargement, dilation relates to a change in the size of an object. A [[line segment]] of points (-7, 7) and (7, 7) enlarged to double its size relative  to the origin (0, 0) would have the image consist of (-14, 14) and (14, 14).</div>
