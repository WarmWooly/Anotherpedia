      <h1>Transvestigation</h1>
      <div>A transvestigation is the transphobic and conspiratorial process of investigating if a person, typically a public figure, is transgender (or sometimes cisgender). Transvestigating is especially prominent within sports, where the sex of an individual may impact performance. Transvestigators usually utilize gender stereotypes, skull structure, and differences within physiology to make claims of the "true" gender of a person. Notable figures who have been transvestigated include Taylor Swift, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams. Transvestigations tend to happen on social media platforms, including Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.</div>
