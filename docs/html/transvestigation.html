  <h1>Transvestigation</h1>
  <div>A {{btransvestigation}} is the transphobia and conspiracy theory process of investigating if a person, typically a public figure, is transgender (or sometimes cisgender). Transvestigating is especially prominent within transgender people in sports, where the biological sex of an individual may impact sport performance. Transvestigators usually utilize gender stereotype, skull, and sex differences in human physiology to make claim of the "true" gender of a person. Notable figures who have been transvestigated include Taylor Swift, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams. Transvestigations tend to happen on social media, including Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.</div>
