  <h1>Trap Roomba (Attack of the Roombas)</h1>
  <div><<info||Stats||Health|0.25x base (1--4 HP)||Speed|0%||Size|~20%info>>The Trap Roomba is an enemy in Attack of the Roombas that is generated from the Trapper Roomba (Attack of the Roombas) or the Final Boss Roomba (Attack of the Roombas). Every 8.33 seconds, a Trap Roomba will be generated. While they may be immobile, their small size makes them quite a difficult obstacle to remove by the player (Attack of the Roombas). Trap Roombas do not award a kill on destruction.</div>
