      <div><<info||Stats||Health|0.25x base (1--4 HP)||Speed|0%||Size|~20%info>>The Trap Roomba is an enemy in Attack of the Roombas that is generated from the Trapper Roomba or the Final Boss Roomba. Every 8.33 seconds, a Trap Roomba will be generated. While they may be immobile, their small size makes them quite a difficult obstacle to remove by the player. Trap Roombas do not award a kill on destruction.</div>
