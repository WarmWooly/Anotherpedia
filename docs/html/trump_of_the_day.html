      <div>Trump Of The Day is a news aggregator website for news related to the United States president Donald Trump created by Divij Pawar. It features a calendar to sort through news articles scraped between January 20, 2025 (Trump's second inauguration) and the present day <<asofOctober 2025>>. The titles, news site, date, a summary, and a relevant image (if possible) of the articles are listed out, with an AI system to rank articles while attempting to avoid redundancy. All articles collected feature Trump in some capacity, either as the focal point of the article or as a major contributor to the discussed topic.</div>
