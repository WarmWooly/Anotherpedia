      <h1>Trump put the fries in the bag</h1>
      <div>Trump put the fries in the bag refers to the then-former President Donald Trump placing a container of McDonald's fries into a paper bag at a McDonald's in Feasterville-Trevose, PA during a publicity stunt on Sunday, October 20th, which has since became a meme playing off of put the fries in the bag. During Trump's stunt at the location, guided by workers, Trump filled a cardboard fry container with fresh fries. He then placed the container of fries into the paper bag, before handing it to a customer in the drive-through window. The phase "put the fries in the bag" is derogatory towards fast food employees, framing the person as inferior to the one buying the fries. Pairing this with Trump, the then-former US president, makes for a stark contrast that increases the meme's popularity.</div>
