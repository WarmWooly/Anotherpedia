      <h1>Turn (Yu-Gi-Oh!)</h1>
      <div>A Turn is the way of structuring play in the game Yu-Gi-Oh! A turn is divided into 6 phases. A turn can only end after the End Phase is concluded. The next player's turn starts once the turn is concluded at the end of the End Phase. During a turn, a player may choose and conduct their actions based on what the current phase of the current turn is and what the effects of their cards can do. It is possible for other players to activate effects during the current turn player's turn. In some situations, the Battle Phase won't be conducted. In those cases, the turn will skip over the Battle Phase and the Main Phase 2, going directly to the End Phase.</div>
