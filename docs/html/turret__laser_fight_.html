      <h1>Turret (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>Turret is a kill streak (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) that allows a player to construct a Turret. Placing a Turret requires the player to hold any gun (Laser Fight) (besides the Sword (Laser Fight) or Star Blade (Laser Fight)) in an open space on the ground. The Turret will then "inherit" the held gun's properties, with the range determined by the bullet duration. Turrets will only turn and shoot at opponents. Turrets can be damaged by shooting them, where they will smoke and burn at low HP. Turrets will also disappear after a fixed time. Turrets can only target the closest player and will not shoot if an ally is nearby. Death messages will replace the player's name with "Player's Turret" when a Turret kills a player. Destroying a Turret awards 350 experience (Laser Fight) and causes an explosion.<<tableLevel|Skill Points|Kill Points|Effect||rLvl. 1|r-|r7|3 Turret health<br>30 sec lifespan||rLvl. 2|r4|r8|4 Turret health<br>45 sec lifespan||rLvl. 3|r5|r9|5 Turret health<br>60 sec lifespan||rLvl. 4|r5|r10|6 Turret health<br>90 sec lifespan||rLvl. 5|r6|r12|8 Turret health<br>120 sec lifespantable>>

A Turret will start smoking and burning when it is low on HP, and will explode on death. Players near the explosion will get killed, with the death screen saying "An Explosion killed you!" with one of the following death messages appearing in the feed:;;X was turned into dust|X blew up|X kicked the Turret too hard|X went out with a bang|X missed the creeper behind them|X exploded|X thought the Turret would go out peacefully;;Exploded Turrets will despawn after a few seconds.</div>
