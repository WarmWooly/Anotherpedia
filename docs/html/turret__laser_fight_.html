      <h1>Turret ({{iLaser Fight}})</h1>
      <div><<shortAlly kill streak in {{iLaser Fight}}short>><<img(src=git/turret laser fight.png(cap=The Turret kill streak.img>>{{bTurret}} is a [[kill streak|kill streak (Laser Fight)]] in {{i[[Laser Fight|Laser Fight (Roblox game)]]}} that allows a player to construct a Turret. Placing a Turret requires the player to hold any [[gun|gun (Laser Fight)]] (besides the [[Sword|Sword (Laser Fight)]] or [[Star Blade|Star Blade (Laser Fight)]]) in an open space on the ground. The Turret will then "inherit" the held gun's properties, with the range determined by the bullet duration. Turrets will only turn and shoot at opponents. Turrets can be damaged by shooting them, where they will smoke and burn at low HP. Turrets will also disappear after a fixed time. Turrets can only target the closest player and will not shoot if an ally is nearby. Death messages will replace the player's name with "Player's Turret" when a Turret kills a player. Destroying a Turret awards 350 [[exp|experience (Laser Fight)]] and causes an explosion.<<table{{bLevel}}|{{bSkill Points}}|{{bKill Points}}|{{bEffect}}||{{rLvl. 1}}|{{r-}}|{{r7}}|3 Turret health&sp30 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 2}}|{{r4}}|{{r8}}|4 Turret health&sp45 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 3}}|{{r5}}|{{r9}}|5 Turret health&sp60 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 4}}|{{r5}}|{{r10}}|6 Turret health&sp90 sec lifespan||{{rLvl. 5}}|{{r6}}|{{r12}}|8 Turret health&sp120 sec lifespantable>><<hrExplosionhr>>A Turret will start smoking and burning when it is low on HP, and will explode on death.
