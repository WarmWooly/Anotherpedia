      <div><<shortChaos God in Warhammershort>><<img(src=git/tzeentch.png(cap=Tzeentch's [[mark|Mark of Tzeentch]].img>>{{bTzeentch}} is one of the main four [[Chaos Gods|Chaos God (Warhammer)]] in [[Warhammer]], specifically {{i[[Warhammer: The Old World]]}}. Tzeentch is known for trickery, cunning, and most importantly, change through Chaos. His followers, once mutated, turn into bird-like deamons, with greater deamons of Tzeentch also following this design. Lesser deamons of the Tzeentch tend to be magical creatures with a variety of magical attacks and spells. The winds of magic are Tzeentch's to command.</div>
