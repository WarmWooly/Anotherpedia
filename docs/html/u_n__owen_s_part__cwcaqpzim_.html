      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Epic||Stack size|1||Fire/lava&spresistance|Yes||Item Tooltip||"Holy moley a Grognak's Absurd Escapades Reference"||Item ID||cwcaqpzim:un_owen_partinfo>>U.N. Owen's Part is a tool first added in the 1.1.3b version of the Minecraft mod Conner's Wacky Crazy And Quite Possibly Zany Items Mod. This tool is based on the item of the same name from Grognak's Absurd Escapades, which is itself based on the artifact Tool from Beyond from Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. This tool is the last part of the progression of the The dimension. This tool can be obtained by placing down 5 Machine Part Container blocks down on 5 specific blocks, opening the GUI by right-clicking the block, placing the correct Infernal Machine Part inside of the slot, pressing the "Activate" button, then opening up a Machine Part Container that has been placed on top of a Waxed Cut Copper block, pressing the "Check Machine Parts" button, then pressing the "Activate Machine" button if all parts are in their correct locations. U.N. Owen's Part will appear in the center slot of the GUI.
U.N. Owen's Part allows the player to travel between dimensions by opening up their respective portals. By right-clicking with the tool in your main hand, a GUI will open up. Inside this GUI, the player can select what dimension to open a portal to. The only dimensions current available for travel to via the usage of U.N. Owen's Part as of version 1.1.3b are the Nether, the End, the Nendther, the Andesite Slab Realm, and the The dimension.</div>
