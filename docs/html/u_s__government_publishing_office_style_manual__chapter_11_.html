      <div>See more: List of {{aiU.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual}} chapters}}<br>Chapter 11 is a chapter in the U.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual, starting on page 269 of the 2016 publication. Chapter 11 is titled "Italic", discussing the use and guidelines for italics. The chapter is 4 pages long and has 5 subsections.

Chapter 11 refers to also check Chapter 9 "Abbreviations and Letter Symbols” and Chapter 16  “Datelines, Addresses, and Signatures”. It opens with:<br>11.1. Italic is sometimes used to differentiate or to give greater prominence to words, phrases, etc. However, an excessive amount of italic defeats this purpose and should be restricted.

This subsection, covering 11.2-5., discusses how italics is used when emphasising text, covering foreign words, and for titles.11.2. Italic is not used for mere emphasis, foreign words, or the titles of publications.<br><br>11.3. In nonlegal work, ante, post, infra, and supra are italicized only when part of a legal citation. Otherwise these terms, as well as the abbreviations id., ibid., op. cit., et seq., and other foreign words, phrases, and their abbreviations, are printed in roman.<br><br>11.4. When [emphasis in original], [emphasis supplied], [emphasis added], or [emphasis ours] appears in copy, it should not be changed; but “underscore supplied” should be changed to “italic supplied.” Therefore, when emphasis in quoted or extracted text is referred to by the foregoing terms, such emphasized text must be reflected and set in italic.<br><br>11.5. When copy is submitted with instructions to set “all roman (no italic),” these instructions will not apply to Ordered, Resolved, Be it enacted, etc.; titles following signatures or addresses; or the parts of datelines that are always set in italic.
