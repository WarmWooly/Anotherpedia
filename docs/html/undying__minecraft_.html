  <h1>Undying (Minecraft)</h1>
  <div>{{tThis is related to the process of removing dye (Minecraft) from item (Minecraft) and block (Minecraft). For the item to cheat death (Minecraft), see Totem of Undying ({{aiMinecraft}}).}}&sp{{bUndying}} is an action in {{iMinecraft}} to remove dyes from blocks and items, reverting them to their undyed state. The main use of undying is to return the item to its original color. To undye an item, use (Minecraft) a dyed item on a cauldron (Minecraft) with undyed water (Minecraft). This will take a third of the water from the cauldron and undye the item.&p<<AsofTrails and Tales (Minecraft)>>, the only items that can be undyed are shulker box (Minecraft), leather armor (Minecraft), and patterns on banner (Minecraft). When washing banners, every use will remove the top layer (most recently added pattern) from the banner. The base color of the banner can't be removed by undying. Other blocks such as wool (Minecraft) and carpet (Minecraft) have been discussed to be available to undye, but there has been no official consideration to expand the undying mechanic.
{{tMain page: Bleach ({{aiMinecraft Education}})}}&spBleach is an item available in {{iMinecraft Education}} or {{iMinecraft: Bedrock Edition}} with "Education" enabled. It can be made in a lab table (Minecraft Education) and is used to turn dyed items white. When crafting (Minecraft) with any dyed banner, bed (Minecraft), carpet, or wool, they will be bleached back to white.</div>
