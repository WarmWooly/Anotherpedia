The main use of undying is to return the item to its original color. To undye an item, [[use|use (Minecraft)]] a dyed item on a [[cauldron|cauldron (Minecraft)]] with undyed [[water|water (Minecraft)]]. This will take a third of the water from the cauldron and undye the item.&p<<Asof[[1.20|Trails and Tales (Minecraft)]]>>, the only items that can be undyed are [[shulker boxes|shulker box (Minecraft)]], [[leather armor|leather armor (Minecraft)]], and patterns on [[banners|banner (Minecraft)]]. When washing banners, every use will remove the top layer (most recently added pattern) from the banner. The base color of the banner can't be removed by undying. Other blocks such as [[wool|wool (Minecraft)]] and [[carpet|carpet (Minecraft)]] have been discussed to be available to undye, but there has been no official consideration to expand the undying mechanic.<<hrBleachinghr>>{{tMain page: [[Bleach ({{aiMinecraft Education}})]]}}&sp<<img(src=git/bleach undying.jpg(cap=Bleach being used with wool to undye it.img>>Bleach is an item available in {{i[[Minecraft Education]]}} or {{i[[Minecraft: Bedrock Edition]]}} with "Education" enabled.
