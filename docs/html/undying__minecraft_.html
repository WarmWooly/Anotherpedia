      <h1>Undying (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div>This is related to the process of removing dyes from items and blocks. For the item to cheat death, see Totem of Undying ({{aiMinecraft).}}&spUndying is an action in Minecraft to remove dyes from blocks and items, reverting them to their undyed state. The main use of undying is to return the item to its original color. To undye an item, use a dyed item on a cauldron with undyed water. This will take a third of the water from the cauldron and undye the item.&p<<Asof1.20>>, the only items that can be undyed are shulker boxes, leather armor, and patterns on banners. When washing banners, every use will remove the top layer (most recently added pattern) from the banner. The base color of the banner can't be removed by undying. Other blocks such as wool and carpet have been discussed to be available to undye, but there has been no official consideration to expand the undying mechanic.
Main page: Bleach ({{aiMinecraft Education)}}&spBleach is an item available in Minecraft Education or Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with "Education" enabled. It can be made in a lab table and is used to turn dyed items white. When crafted with any dyed banner, bed, carpet, or wool, they will be bleached back to white.</div>
