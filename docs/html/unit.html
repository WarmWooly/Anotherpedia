  <h1>Unit</h1>
  <div>{{tFor the part of a whole see unit (part), and for the shape, see unit square, unit circle, unit cube, and unit sphere.}}&spA {{bunit}}, when describing measurement, is a quantity of a thing or property that does not change. An example would be inch, which is a fixed distance that can be used for measurements. This terminology is also used in mathematics, where it can be used as a placeholder for an indeterminate value without an attachment to reality. Other systems, such as currency, also utilize the term unit for similar purposes.</div>
