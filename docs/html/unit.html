      <h1>Unit</h1>
      <div>For the part of a whole see unit (part), and for the shapes, see unit square, unit circle, unit cube, and unit sphere.<br>A unit, when describing measurements, is a quantity of a thing or property that does not change. An example would be inches, which is a fixed distance that can be used for measurements. This terminology is also used in mathematics, where it can be used as a placeholder for an indeterminate value without an attachment to reality. Other systems, such as currency, also utilize the term unit for similar purposes.</div>
