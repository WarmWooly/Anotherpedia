      <h1>Unit circle</h1>
      <div>A unit circle is a mathematical concept of a circle where the radius is equal to 1 unit. Unit circles are often used in trigonometry. The unit circle is placed on the origin of a coordinate plane. It can be used as a reference for functions and angle measurements, especially when working between radians and degrees.</div>
