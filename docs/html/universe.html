  <h1>Universe</h1>
  <div><<shortContainer of realityshort>><<img(src=git/universe.jpg(cap=An [[image]] of the [[cosmic microwave background]] from [[NASA]].img>>The {{buniverse}} is filled with all known [[matter]] and [[energy]], constituting all of [[reality]].<<hrObservabilityhr>>The universe is often discussed in two parts: the observable universe and the unobservable universe. They are defined based on if [[light]] traveling from that [[location]] would reach [[us|Humanity]]. Anything that can be [[measured|Measurement]] is inside the observable universe, hence, the observability. The observable universe is currently 94 billion [[light years|Light Year]] in [[diameter]].&pDue to the nature of the unobservable universe, it is [[impossible]] to determine the [[size]] or contents.<<hrBirthhr>>{{tMain page: [[Big Bang]]}}&spThe current theory for the born of the universe is with an [[event]] called the Big Bang. All matter was condensed into a single point, and at a random moment, everything expanded in a sort of [[explosion]]. The expansion is continuing, leading to the worrisome [[end of the universe|Big Rip]]. The universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.<<hrSimulationhr>>{{tMain page: [[Simulation Theory]]}}&spIt is theorized that the universe is a [[simulation]] created by an advanced species, and that we're inside of it. One of the main reasons is that the Big Bang seemed to be when the universe "turned on". This is a possibility, but it would require immense power and computing technologies that we haven't even comprehended yet.</div>
