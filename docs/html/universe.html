      <h1>Universe</h1>
      <div>The universe is filled with all known matter and energy, constituting all of reality.
The universe is often discussed in two parts: the observable universe and the unobservable universe. They are defined based on if light traveling from that location would reach Humanity. Anything that can be Measurement is inside the observable universe, hence, the observability. The observable universe is currently 94 billion Light Year in diameter.&pDue to the nature of the unobservable universe, it is impossible to determine the size or contents.
Main page: Big Bang&spThe current theory for the born of the universe is with an event called the Big Bang. All matter was condensed into a single point, and at a random moment, everything expanded in a sort of explosion. The expansion is continuing, leading to the worrisome Big Rip. The universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old.
Main page: Simulation Theory&spIt is theorized that the universe is a simulation created by an advanced species, and that we're inside of it. One of the main reasons is that the Big Bang seemed to be when the universe "turned on". This is a possibility, but it would require immense power and computing technologies that we haven't even comprehended yet.</div>
