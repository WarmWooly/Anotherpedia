      <h1>Upsetting mill</h1>
      <div>An upsetting mill, also called a rimming mill or upsetting machine, is a machine that is used to upsetting (mint) coin blank into planchet through raising the blanks' rim. Upsetting mills are utilized in the coining (mint) process and may be done within a mint (facility) or a dedicated factory. The machine itself has blanks pushed through a track with the space reducing, forcing the blanks' rims upwards as they are squeezed through.</div>
