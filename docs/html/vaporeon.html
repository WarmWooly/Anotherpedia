      <h1>Vaporeon</h1>
      <div>Vaporeon is an aquatic Water type Pokémon from the first generation.

Vaporeon is a mix of a mammal and a fish in appearance. Vaporeon has four legs and a long, mermaid-like tail, all in a blue color. A darker blue ridge flows from the tip of its tail to its white ruffle around its neck. Vaporeon has three fins on its head with a tan inner color, with a mouth, dot nose, and a pair of large eyes. Vaporeon's official size is 3 ft, 3 in, while weighing 63.9 lbs. Shiny Vaporeons have a pink body and deeper purple colorings instead of blue.<br><br>Vaporeon's name is a portmanteau of vapor and eon.

Vaporeon is known to have an appetite for fish Pokémon, living near clean bodies of water. It is able to become invisible in water because its body takes a similar form to the molecules, which it uses to flee from predators. Vaporeon can also control water at will. When Vaporeon senses moisture, it's fins will vibrate, warning of impending rain.

Vaporeon has an 87.5/12.5 chance to be male or female. Vaporeon is the 134th Pokémon in the Pokédex and has the Pokédex color blue.<br><br>Vaporeon evolves from Eevee that has been exposed to a Water Stone.</div>
