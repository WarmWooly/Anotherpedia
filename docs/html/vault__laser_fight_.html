      <h1>Vault (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A vault is an automatic movement action in Laser Fight triggered by a player jumping near a wall with a height of 5 studs or less. Vaulting increases the horizontal and vertical speed of the player and awards 2 exp. 

Main page: Combo (aiLaser Fight)

When a vault is done back-to-back, they will be combined together. After 10 vaults, a new vault chain will be started. The following is all the back-to-back combinations for vaulting:<<tableCombo|Exp||Bivault|r1||Trivault|r1||Quadvault|r1||Quintvault|r1||Sexvault|r1||Septvault|r1||Octvault|r2||Nonvault|r2||Decvault|r3table>>

When chaining a vault into a slide into a dive (vault --> slide --> dive), a hop, skip, and a jump will be preformed, awarding 5 exp.</div>
