      <h1>Very Far Away Horse</h1>
      <div>For the video game based on the meme, see {{aiFar Away Horse.}}<br>{{iVery Far Away Horse}} is a internet meme originally from the obvious plant's Obvious Plant's Museum of Toys pop-up exhibition. The image itself was taken by Vsauce and posted to Twitter on March 3, 2019, alongside others taken at the exhibition. The game would run on the GameCube rated Teen by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, with the game having an Official Nintendo Seal and being the "video game editions". The original display was to poke fun at such a mundane game, with the idea that it got The Game Award for Game of the Year and that it would be rated Teen adding to the absurdity. The art piece itself was made by the cartoonist pixelatedboat for the exhibition. A popular variation of the image has a Snapchat caption labeled "should i buy this?" over the game.</div>
