      <h1>Vinegar Bottle (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|16||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The vinegar bottle is an item (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used for pickling foods, oxidation (Minecraft) copper (Minecraft), and boosting the chain launcher (Not Lazy Chainmail).



In a brewing stand (Minecraft), sugar water bottle (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be brewed with a fermented spider eye (Minecraft) to produce vinegar bottles.



Vinegar bottles are used in the following crafting (Minecraft) recipes:<br>Pickled Beetroot (Not Lazy Chainmail) x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 beetroot (Minecraft) (shapeless; a glass bottle (Minecraft) is returned).<br>Pickled Carrot (Not Lazy Chainmail) x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 carrot (Minecraft) (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).<br>Pickled Egg (Not Lazy Chainmail) x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 egg (Minecraft) (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).<br>Pickled Potato (Not Lazy Chainmail) x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 potato (Minecraft) (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).

When using a vinegar bottle on a copper block, the block will go to its next oxidation stage (none --> exposed --> weathered --> oxidized) and a glass bottle (Minecraft) will be returned. Doing so will award the advancement (Minecraft) Oxide On (Not Lazy Chainmail). Honeycomb (Minecraft) copper blocks can't be oxidized using vinegar. If the player is sneaking (Minecraft) while using a vinegar bottle on a fully oxidized block, oxide dust (Not Lazy Chainmail) will be produced.

Main page: Chain Launcher ({{aiNot Lazy Chainmail)}}<br>When a vinegar bottle is held in the offhand (Minecraft), the launch power of  chain launcher (Not Lazy Chainmail) will increase by 214.3%, "boosting" the launch and dropping an empty glass bottle (Minecraft). Boosting while airborne (with the Ascension (Not Lazy Chainmail) enchantment) will award the advancement Flight in All but Name (Not Lazy Chainmail). When launching a mob (Minecraft) with vinegar in the offhand, the mob launch will be boosted and the player will be awarded the advancement We're Blasting Off Again! (Not Lazy Chainmail)</div>
