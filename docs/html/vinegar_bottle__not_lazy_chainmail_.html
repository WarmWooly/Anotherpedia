In a brewing stand, sugar water bottles can be brewed with a fermented spider eye to produce vinegar bottles.
Vinegar bottles are used in the following crafting recipes:&spPickled Beetroot x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 beetroots (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).&spPickled Carrot x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 carrots (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).&spPickled Egg x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 eggs (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).&spPickled Potato x3 - 1 vinegar bottle and 3 potatoes (shapeless; a glass bottle is returned).
