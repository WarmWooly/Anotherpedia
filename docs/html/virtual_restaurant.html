      <h1>Virtual restaurant</h1>
      <div>A virtual restaurant, also known as a ghost kitchen or an e-restaurant, is a building where people can purchase food and drinks using an external medium (ex. phone calls, internet) where food is prepared and shipped. This allows companies to use fewer buildings, experiment with new ideas, follow and respond to trends, and increase food diversity in an area. The main difference between a restaurant and a virtual restaurant is that there are no accommodations for people to eat inside the building.</div>
