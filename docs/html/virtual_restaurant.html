      <h1>Virtual restaurant</h1>
      <div>A virtual restaurant, also known as a ghost kitchen or an e-restaurant, is a building where people can purchase food and drink using an external medium (ex. phone food service, online food ordering) where food is food preparation and food delivery. This allows company to use fewer buildings, experiment with new ideas, follow and respond to trend, and increase food diversity in an area. The main difference between a restaurant and a virtual restaurant is that there are no accommodations for people to eating inside the building.</div>
