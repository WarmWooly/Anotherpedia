  <h1>Viscosity (Mindustry)</h1>
  <div>{{bViscosity}} is a characteristic of liquid (Mindustry) in {{iMindustry}} that determines the spread of liquids, with more Viscosity increasing spread distance. Viscosity does not affect gasses as they dissipate into the air. The following table shows the Viscosity of all liquids in {{iMindustry}}:<<table{{bLiquid}}|{{bViscosity}}||Water (Mindustry)|{{r50%}}||Slag (Mindustry)|{{r70%}}||Oil (Mindustry)|{{r75%}}||Cryofluid (Mindustry)|{{r50%}}||Neoplasm (Mindustry)|{{r85%}}||Arkycite (Mindustry)|{{r70%}}||Ozone (Mindustry)|{{r50%}}||Hydrogen (Mindustry)|{{r50%}}||Nitrogen (Mindustry)|{{r50%}}||Cyanogen (Mindustry)|{{r50%}}table>>
There are misconceptions regarding the effect of Viscosity in Mindustry, most likely because of the entry in the Mindustry Unofficial Wiki.<<ref(content=link|https://mindustry-unofficial.fandom.com/wiki/Item_and_Liquid_Properties(text=refCountref>> Viscosity does not change the flow rate of Conduits<<note(content=Flow rate is determined by the liquid capacity of Conduits, with every liquid unit (Mindustry) equating to 48 liquid units/sec passing through. Conduit (Mindustry) (10 liq. cap., 480 lu/s), Pulse Conduit (Mindustry)/Plated Conduit (Mindustry) (16 liq. cap., 768 lu/s), and Reinforced Conduit (Mindustry) (20 liq. cap., 960 lu/s) all have fixed flow rates.(text=noteCountnote>> nor the range (Mindustry) of the Wave (Mindustry) and Tsunami (Mindustry).<<note(content=Range is determined by the turret. Waves (13.75 block (Mindustry)) and Tsunamis (23.75 blocks) have fixed ranges.(text=noteCountnote>> Viscosity only affects how liquids spread along the ground.</div>
