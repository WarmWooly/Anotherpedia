      <h1>Viscosity (Mindustry)</h1>
      <div>Viscosity is a characteristic of liquid (Mindustry) in Mindustry that determines the spread of liquids, with more Viscosity increasing spread distance. Viscosity does not affect gasses as they dissipate into the air. The following table shows the Viscosity of all liquids in Mindustry:<<tableLiquid|Viscosity||Water (Mindustry)|r50%||Slag (Mindustry)|r70%||Oil (Mindustry)|r75%||Cryofluid (Mindustry)|r50%||Neoplasm (Mindustry)|r85%||Arkycite (Mindustry)|r70%||Ozone (Mindustry)|r50%||Hydrogen (Mindustry)|r50%||Nitrogen (Mindustry)|r50%||Cyanogen (Mindustry)|r50%table>>

There are misconceptions regarding the effect of Viscosity in Mindustry, most likely because of the entry in the Mindustry Unofficial Wiki. Viscosity does not change the flow rate of Conduits nor the range (Mindustry) of the Wave (Mindustry) and Tsunami (Mindustry). Viscosity only affects how liquids spread along the ground.</div>
