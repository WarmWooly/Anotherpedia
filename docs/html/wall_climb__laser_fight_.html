  <h1>Wall climb (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>A wall climb is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by a player jump (Laser Fight) out of a wall hang (Laser Fight). If the player is sprint (Laser Fight) while doing so, a wall launch (Laser Fight) will be performed instead. By doing a wall climb, the player gains a little horizontal and vertical velocity to be placed above the wall they were hanging on, being especially useful for trying to stand on thinner walls out of a wall hang. A wall climb gives the player 3 experience (Laser Fight).</div>
