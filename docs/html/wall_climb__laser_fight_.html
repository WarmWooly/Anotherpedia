      <h1>Wall climb (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A wall climb is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by a player jumping out of a wall hang. If the player is sprinting while doing so, a wall launch will be performed instead. By doing a wall climb, the player gains a little horizontal and vertical velocity to be placed above the wall they were hanging on, being especially useful for trying to stand on thinner walls out of a wall hang.  A wall climb gives the player 3 exp.</div>
