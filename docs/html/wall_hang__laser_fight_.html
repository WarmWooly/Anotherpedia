  <h1>Wall hang (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>A {{bwall hang}} is an automatic movement (Laser Fight) in {{iLaser Fight (Roblox game)}} triggered by a player jumping near a wall with a height of 7 studs or more. A few walls will have built-in exceptions that prevent wall hanging, primarily for map geometry on flush surfaces. While wall hanging, the player will slowly lose stamina (Laser Fight), dropping from the wall if they look away, move backwards, or run out of stamina. Jump (Laser Fight) will cause the player to wall climb (Laser Fight), while sprint (Laser Fight) jumping will cause the player to wall launch (Laser Fight) into the air.</div>
