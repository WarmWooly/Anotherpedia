      <h1>Wall hang (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A wall hang is an automatic movement action in Laser Fight triggered by a player jumping near a wall with a height of 7 studs or more. A few walls will have built-in exceptions that prevent wall hanging, primarily for map geometry on flush surfaces. While wall hanging, the player will slowly lose stamina, dropping from the wall if they look away, move backwards, or run out of stamina. Jumping will cause the player to wall climb, while sprint jumping will cause the player to wall launch into the air.</div>
