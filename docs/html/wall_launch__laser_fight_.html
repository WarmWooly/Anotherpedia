  <h1>Wall launch (Laser Fight)</h1>
  <div>For the gun (Laser Fight), see Wall Launcher ({{aiLaser Fight).}}&spA wall launch is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by a player jump (Laser Fight) while sprint (Laser Fight) out of a wall hang (Laser Fight). If the player is not sprinting while doing so, a wall climb (Laser Fight) will be performed instead. By doing a wall launch, the player gains a lot of vertical velocity to be flung above the wall they were hanging on, which can then be used to get to other raised locations. A wall launch gives the player 2 experience (Laser Fight).</div>
