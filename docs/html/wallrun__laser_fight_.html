      <h1>Wallrun (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A wallrun is a movement action in Laser Fight triggered by a player holding codeR while parallel to a wall while being airborne. While wallrunning, a player will steadily lose stamina, dropping from a wallrun if they look away, jump, dive, release codeR, or run out of stamina. A player can restart a wallrun immediately after jumping, allowing players to scale up long, flat walls. Starting a wallrun will award 3 exp. Diving while wallrunning will perform a forceful wallrun dismount, awarding 2 exp. Doing a wallrun into a wall climb will perform an up and over, giving 2 exp, while a wall launch will perform a swift traveral, giving 3 exp. Wallrunning will cancel fall damage, and if a player does so to save themselves from a lethal ollie/nollie, they will perform a wall save and gain 3/4 exp.</div>
