      <h1>Wallrun (Laser Fight)</h1>
      <div>A wallrun is a movement (Laser Fight) in Laser Fight (Roblox game) triggered by a player holding codeR while parallel to a wall while being airborne. While wallrunning, a player will steadily lose stamina (Laser Fight), dropping from a wallrun if they look away, jump (Laser Fight), dive (Laser Fight), release codeR, or run out of stamina. A player can restart a wallrun immediately after jumping, allowing players to scale up long, flat walls. Starting a wallrun will award 3 experience (Laser Fight). Diving while wallrunning will perform a forceful wallrun dismount (Laser Fight), awarding 2 exp. Doing a wallrun into a wall climb (Laser Fight) will perform an up and over (Laser Fight), giving 2 exp, while a wall launch (Laser Fight) will perform a swift traveral (Laser Fight), giving 3 exp. Wallrunning will cancel fall damage (Laser Fight), and if a player does so to save themselves from a lethal ollie/nollie (Laser Fight), they will perform a wall save (Laser Fight) and gain 3/4 exp.</div>
