  <h1>Wandering hour</h1>
  <div>A wandering hour is a type of analog complication (horology) in clock and watch where the hour hovers over the minute underneath it as it moves in an arc. It is comprised of the minutes, usually in 5 or 10-minute intervals, a central gear holding the arms, and a smaller gear to spin the main gear. The arms each contain 3 or 4 hours, with 4 and 3 arms respectively.</div>
