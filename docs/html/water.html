      <h1>Water</h1>
      <div>Water, also known as Hs-b2O or dihydrogen monoxide, is a clear liquid substance found across Earth.<br><br>Water may take other forms, such as a solid (ice) and as a gas (water vapor). Water freezes at 32 °F (0 °C) and boils at 212 °F (100 °C).<br><br>Most water on Earth is filled with salt in oceans, and is unsafe for humans to drink. Freshwater is potable, but the majority is in ice.<br><br>Humans are 60% water, and are expected to drink over 12 cups of water a day.</div>
