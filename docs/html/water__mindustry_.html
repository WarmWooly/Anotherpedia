The description of Water is the following:It has an Exposiveness of 0%, a Flammability of 0%, a Heat Capacity of 40%, a Viscosity of 50%, and a Temperature of 50%. On Serpulo, Water can be used to create Spore Pods, Graphite, Oil, and Cryofluid, to generate power in a Steam Generator, can be used as a liquid ammo, and can be used to boost the fire rate of turrets. On Erekir, Water can be used to create Ozone and Hydrogen, to generate power in a Neoplasia Reactor, to run Impact Drills, and to boost the fire rate of turrets.
