  <h1>Water ({{iMindustry}})</h1>
  <div><<shortCooling liquid in {{iMindustry}}short>><<img(src=git/water mindustry.png(cap=Water.img>>{{bWater}} is a [[liquid|liquid (Mindustry)]] in {{i[[Mindustry]]}} on [[Serpulo|Serpulo (Mindustry)]] and [[Erekir|Erekir (Mindustry)]] and can be obtained through various means. On Serpulo, Water can be collected through pools of water tiles on the surface using a [[Mechanical Pump|Mechanical Pump (Mindustry)]] or better or through a [[Water Extractor|Water Extractor (Mindustry)]]. On Erekir, Water can be collected through [[Turbine|Turbine Condenser (Mindustry)]] and [[Vent Condensers|Vent Condenser (Mindustry)]] and as a byproduct from a [[Pyrolysis Generator|Pyrolysis Generator (Mindustry)]]. The description of Water is the following:<<quoUsed for cooling machines and waste processing.quo>>It has an [[Exposiveness|explosiveness (Mindustry)]] of 0%, a [[Flammability|flammability (Mindustry)]] of 0%, a [[Heat Capacity|heat capacity (Mindustry)]] of 40%, a [[Viscosity|viscosity (Mindustry)]] of 50%, and a [[Temperature|temperature (Mindustry)]] of 50%. On Serpulo, Water can be used to create [[Spore Pods|Spore Pod (Mindustry)]], [[Graphite|Graphite (Mindustry)]], [[Oil|Oil (Mindustry)]], and [[Cryofluid|Cryofluid (Mindustry)]], to generate [[power|power (Mindustry)]] in a [[Steam Generator|Steam Generator (Mindustry)]], can be used as a liquid [[ammo|ammo (Mindustry)]], and can be used to boost the fire rate of [[turrets|turret (Mindustry)]]. On Erekir, Water can be used to create [[Ozone|Ozone (Mindustry)]] and [[Hydrogen|Hydrogen (Mindustry)]], to generate power in a [[Neoplasia Reactor|Neoplasia Reactor (Mindustry)]], to run [[Impact Drills|Impact Drill (Mindustry)]], and to boost the fire rate of turrets. When touched, either from entering a pool or being shot, it will give the [[unit|unit (Mindustry)]] the [[Wet|Wet (Mindustry)]] effect.</div>
