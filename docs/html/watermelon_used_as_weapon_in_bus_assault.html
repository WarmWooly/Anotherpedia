It describes how the [[Northern Territory|Northern Territory (Australia)]] [[police]] [[arrested|arrest]] a [[man|person]] who was 40 years old for smashing a [[watermelon]] on the top of the [[bus driver's|bus driver]] head in the northern [[suburbs]] of [[Darwin|Darwin, northern territory]].

[[Debbie Gabolinscy]], who was watching the event unfold, claims that the man exited the bus and then re-entered to continue [[assaulting|assault]] the driver. [[Passengers|Passenger]] nearby separated the driver and [[assailant]], with the driver sustaining minor injuries. The man was arrested afterwards.<<hrarbroath's bloghr>>There is a [[blog]] titled {{i<<link(src=http://arbroath.blogspot.com/2013/01/watermelon-used-as-weapon-in-bus-driver.html(text=Watermelon used as weapon in bus driver assaultlink>>}} on the [[website]] [[Blogger]] under {{iNothing to Do With Arbroath}} by the user [[arbroath|arbroath (Blogger)]] on January 24, 2013, 6:06 [[AM]] that discussed the event. It describes how it was a [[bus]] owned by [[Buslink]], and identifies the location of the incident at the [[Hibiscus Shopping Centre]] in [[Leanyer|Leanyer, Northern Territory]] (a suburb in Darwin) at around [[noon]]. The driver asked the [[drunken|drunk]] man to exit the bus, to where Jones made the driver [[flinch]] until smashing the watermelon, to then throw a [[punch]], which broke the driver's [[glasses]]. Allegedly, his four [[children|child]] were watching the assault unfold.<<hrVICE's storyhr>>On [[VICE]], a story written by [[Toby Fehily]] titled {{i<<link(src=https://www.vice.com/en/article/mvpn5b/watermelon-attacks-rogue-cows-and-dog-sperm-thieves(text=Watermelon Attacks, Rogue Cows and Dog Sperm Thieveslink>>}} on January 24, 2013, 6:37 [[PM]] was posted to the site. In relation to the watermelon story, it re-states the bus's location and actions, omitting the punch from arborath's blog. The assailant was identified as [[Raymond Jones]], a 53-year-old man who drank roughy 700 [[mL|mililiter]] of [[burbon]] from [[Wild Turkey]] before the event. He later pled [[guilty]] in [[court]] for the charges of [[aggravated assault]] and [[disorderly behavior]].<<hrMemeshr>><<yt(src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/99MQwsgmiFQ(cap=A [[YouTube]] video of the meme.yt>>Due to the [[absurdity]] of the situation, people created [[memes|internet meme]] about the story in 2021 and onwards.
