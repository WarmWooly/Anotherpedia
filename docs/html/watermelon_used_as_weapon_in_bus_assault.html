      <h1>Watermelon used as weapon in bus assault</h1>
      <div>The news story Watermelon used as weapon in bus assault was written by Ruby Jones and published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on January 22, 2013.

The <<link(src=http://web.archive.org/web/20221225125207/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-23/watermelon-used-as-weapon-in-bus-assault/4480406#:~:text=Northern%20Territory%20police%20have%20arrested,to%20pay%20his%20bus%20fare.(text=original storylink>> is quite open and vague due to how recent the event was. It describes how the Northern Territory police arrested a man who was 40 years old for smashing a watermelon on the top of the bus driver's head in the northern suburbs of Darwin. Police reported that the conflict started when the driver asked for the fare. Debbie Gabolinscy, who was watching the event unfold, claims that the man exited the bus and then re-entered to continue assaulting the driver. Passengers nearby separated the driver and assailant, with the driver sustaining minor injuries. The man was arrested afterwards.

There is a blog titled <<link(src=http://arbroath.blogspot.com/2013/01/watermelon-used-as-weapon-in-bus-driver.html(text=Watermelon used as weapon in bus driver assaultlink>> on the website Blogger under Nothing to Do With Arbroath by the user arbroath on January 24, 2013, 6:06 AM that discussed the event. It describes how it was a bus owned by Buslink, and identifies the location of the incident at the Hibiscus Shopping Centre in Leanyer (a suburb in Darwin) at around noon. The driver asked the drunken man to exit the bus, to where Jones made the driver flinch until smashing the watermelon, to then throw a punch, which broke the driver's glasses. Allegedly, his four children were watching the assault unfold.

On VICE, a story written by Toby Fehily titled <<link(src=https://www.vice.com/en/article/mvpn5b/watermelon-attacks-rogue-cows-and-dog-sperm-thieves(text=Watermelon Attacks, Rogue Cows and Dog Sperm Thieveslink>> on January 24, 2013, 6:37 PM was posted to the site. In relation to the watermelon story, it re-states the bus's location and actions, omitting the punch from arborath's blog. The assailant was identified as Raymond Jones, a 53-year-old man who drank roughy 700 mL of burbon from Wild Turkey before the event. He later pled guilty in court for the charges of aggravated assault and disorderly behavior.

Due to the absurdity of the situation, people created memes about the story in 2021 and onwards. The main video, created by Meh_here, titled watermelon used as weapon in bus assault meme- pvz meme, is a video that lasts 27 seconds with over 3,500 views <<asofMarch 2024>>. The content of the video is the bus image from the original article with an overlay of the Melon-pult from Plants vs. Zombies, making fun of the scenario by hinting at the idea that Jones was acting like the plant.</div>
