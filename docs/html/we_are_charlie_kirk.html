      <h1>We Are Charlie Kirk</h1>
      <div>"We Are Charlie Kirk" is a song released by Spalexma to commemorate Charlie Kirk after his Assassination of Charlie Kirk on September 16, 2025 for their music album Charlie Kirk Forever Alive. There is a high probability that the song was generated using Music and artificial intelligence. While originally paired with Video and artificial intelligence of celebrity (especially those within right-wing politics), it spread across social media such as TikTok and YouTube Shorts due to the humorous nature of the phrase "We are Charlie Kirk". It continues to be wrapped up in memes about Charlie Kirk, such as Kirkification and "Charlie Charlie Kirky".
