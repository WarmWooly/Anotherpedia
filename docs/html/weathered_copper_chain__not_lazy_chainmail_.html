The weathered copper chain can be crafted with a weathered block of copper chains (makes 4).

Either through random ticks or by right-clicking with a vinegar bottle, an exposed copper chain will become a weathered copper chain. Using a vinegar bottle to oxidize will award the advancement Oxide On.

Right-clicking an oxidized copper chain or a waxed weathered copper chain with an axe will turn the block into a weathered copper chain. Scraping the waxed block will award the advancement Wax Off.
