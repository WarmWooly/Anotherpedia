  <h1>Week</h1>
  <div>A week is a period of time over 7 day used on most parts of the Earth. A week's days are named Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Weeks may start on Sunday or Monday, depending on the region. A week typically has 5 weeday (Monday - Friday) and 2 weekend (Staurday & Sunday), which dictates how time for work, education, religious activity, gathering, and other event (gathering) are planning. There are over 4 weeks in each month (besides February when not on a leap year).</div>
