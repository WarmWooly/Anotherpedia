      <h1>Week</h1>
      <div>A week is a period of time over 7 days used on most parts of the world. A week's days are named Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Weeks may start on Sunday or Monday, depending on the region. A week typically has 5 weekdays (Monday - Friday) and 2 weekends (Staurday & Sunday), which dictates how time for work, education, religious activities, gatherings, and other events are planned. There are over 4 weeks in each month (besides February when not on a leap year).</div>
