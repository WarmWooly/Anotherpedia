      <h1>Weezer Cybertrucks</h1>
      <div>The {{iWeezer Cybertrucks}} are Cybertruck with a custom wrap of the band Weezer music album Weezer (Blue Album) (also known as the Blue Album). The original image of the first Weezer Cybertruck has been passed around social media, especially Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok. The first post related to the Weezer Cybertruck was on Reddit's r/CyberStuck in mid-2024, with r/weezer also having this post passed around. Following this, a second Weezer Cybertruck was found, having the image on the car hood of the Cybertruck instead of along the side. There are currently only two images of Weezer Cybertrucks <<asofJune 2025>>.</div>
