      <h1>Weighted stuffing beads</h1>
      <div>For the glass material used for a similar purpose, see micro glass beads.&spWeighted stuffing beads or poly pellets are plastic pellets used for adding weight to stuffed animals or blankets. Weighted stuffing beads are especially useful for adjusting the center of gravity on stuffed animals to prevent them from tipping over. The beads are generally stored within a small bag or container within the weighted object to prevent the beads from spilling out in the case of a tear.</div>
