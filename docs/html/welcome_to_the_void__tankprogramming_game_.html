      <h1>Welcome to The Void (TankProgramming game)</h1>
      <div>{{iWelcome to The Void}} is a comedy text-based game created by TankProgramming and released onto itch.io. The game is comprised of options that a player may select to progress the story. The player can interact with several members of The Void, including a "Trol", the barkeep, deity, and so on, to obtain endings. Some knowledge persists between endings, allowing for the player to skip over certain content. The game was made for a course on video game design.

The player starts within a bar (establishment) within The Void, where they order food. After leaving the bar, they can re-enter to get their food (which ultimately leads to their demise) or pass a "Trol" to cross a bridge. Beyond the bridge lies a karaoke bar, a swamp, and a shrine. The shrine teaches the player the ability to see a different path laid out after their demise (denoted as "2 3 4". This hints at finding a hidden fourth option to talk to an otherworldly being, who tasks the player with going to the swamp and using the same technique by a pond. After appeasing the "Trol" to get his sickle, the player enters the swamp to find the plant god, Tynan, who teaches them about the fire god, Drynan, and how the player, Tim, is the water god. Drynan, out of boredom, created The Void, shrunk Tynan, and memory wiping of the player. Tynan gives the player one power ring, while they obtain another from performing karaoke.<br><br>Once the player gets the two power rings alongside a sickle, they challenge Drynan to a battle.
