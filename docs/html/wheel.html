      <div>A wheel is a generally circular object connected to an axle that can rotate. Wheels are commonplace among machines, vehicles, and other devices with rotating components, especially for transportation. Tires or similar coverings can be placed on wheels to cushion the interface between the wheel and the surface it is rotating off of. Gears, a type of wheel, utilizes rotation to transport torque or rotational energy between other gears.</div>
