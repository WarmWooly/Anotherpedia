      <h1>When to use an 'An' before an abbreviation</h1>
      <div>Each abbreviation that comes after the word a a must also follow the rules of a and an because each letter has a name, which may start with letters with nouns, thus turning an 'a' into an 'an'. This is a quick guide on when to use such rules for abbreviations. This only applies for the first letter of an abbreviation (such as "This is an HDD"), even when the unabbreviated form uses a different word (such as "This is a hard disk drive").&pA (A) = an&spB (Bee) = a&spC (Cee) = a&spD (Dee) = a&spE (E) = an&spF (Ef) = an&spG (Gee) = a&spH (Aitch) = an&spI (I) = an&spJ (Jay) = a&spK (Kay) = a&spL (El or Ell) = an&spM (Em) = an&spN (En) = an&spO (O) = an&spP (Pee) = a&spQ (Cue) = a&spR (Ar) = an&spS (Ess) = an&spT (Tee) = a&spU (U) = an&spV (Vee) = a&spW (Double-u) = a&spX (Ex) = an&spY (Wye) = a&spZ (Zee or Zed) = a</div>
