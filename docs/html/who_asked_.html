  <h1>Who asked?</h1>
  <div><<shortMeme questioning the purpose of a statementshort>>{{tFor the [[song]], see [[Who Asked (song)]].}}&sp<<img(src=git/who asked.jpg(cap=A [[group photo]] of [[none]], representing nobody asking.img>>{{bWho asked?}} was a [[meme|internet meme]] about a [[comeback]] if someone was [[talking]] about [[unwanted]] or [[unneeded]] [[information]]. Unlike similar comebacks, such as [[TMI|Too Much Information]], it is not that the information should not be said because of [[taboo]] or other explicit details, but rather that the content is [[irrelevant|irrelevancy]] and usually [[off-topic]]. Variations include {{i'Nobody asked.'}} and {{i'That's crazy, but I don't remember asking.'}}, being statements instead of questions.&pThe meme itself often included either someone [[searching]] an area or looking through a [[list]], or an empty photo claiming that was everyone who asked (which would be nobody). It has since fallen out of common use due to the lackluster applications and overuse.</div>
