      <h1>Who asked?</h1>
      <div>For the song, see Who Asked (song).<br>Who asked? was a meme about a comeback if someone was talking about unwanted or unneeded information. Unlike similar comebacks, such as TMI, it is not that the information should not be said because of taboo or other explicit details, but rather that the content is irrelevant and usually off-topic. Variations include 'Nobody asked.' and 'That's crazy, but I don't remember asking.', being statements instead of questions.<br><br>The meme itself often included either someone searching an area or looking through a list, or an empty photo claiming that was everyone who asked (which would be nobody). It has since fallen out of common use due to the lackluster applications and overuse.</div>
