      <h1>Wicked doll misprint</h1>
      <div>The {{iWicked doll misprint}} refers to doll of Glinda (Wicked 2024 film) and Elphaba (Wicked 2024 film) as shown in the 2024 film Wicked (2024 film) having a misprint on the box related to the website for the film. Instead of having a link to <<link(src=https://www.wickedmovie.com/(text=www.wickedmovie.comlink>>, the dedicated website related to the movie, it instead linked to an adult website of a similar, shortened name. Mattel, the company that produced the dolls, has since apologized for allowing such a site to be present on a box for a children's toy.</div>
