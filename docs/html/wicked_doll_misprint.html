  <h1>Wicked doll misprint</h1>
  <div>The {{b{{iWicked}} doll misprint}} refers to doll of Glinda (Wicked 2024 film) and Elphaba (Wicked 2024 film) as shown in the 2024 film {{iWicked (2024 film)}} having a misprint on the box related to the website for the film. Instead of having a link to <<link(src=https://www.wickedmovie.com/(text=www.wickedmovie.comlink>>, the dedicated website related to the movie, it instead linked to an adult website of a similar, shortened name. Mattel, the company that produced the dolls, has since apologized for allowing such a site to be present on a box for a children's toy.<<ref(content=link|https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/business/wicked-movie-dolls-packaging-intl-hnk/index.html(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wicked-dolls-mattel-pornography/(text=refCountref>><<ref(content=link|https://abcnews.go.com/US/mattel-apologizes-link-porn-site-wicked-movie-doll/story?id=115733575(text=refCountref>></div>
