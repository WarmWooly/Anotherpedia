The [[traits|character trait]] of the [[character]] were collectively made on the [[Wikimedia]] article for Wikipede.<<ref(content=link|https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipede(text=refCountref>><<hrAppearancehr>><<img(src=git/kip the wikipede.png(cap=[[Pixel art]] of Kip, made by [[Nolo Pasaro|Nolo Pasaro (artist)]].<<ref(content=link|https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kip_the_Wikipede.png(text=refCountref>>img>>Wikipede is made up of multiple blobby-green segments, with a pair of stubby yellow feet at the bottom, blue segmented antennae at the top, eyes covered by thick [[glasses]], and several arms. The number of arms is variable, with as few as 4. The arms are off-white with the hands resembling yellow [[gloves|glove]].<<hrCharacter informationhr>>Wikipede, or less formally Kip, is a member of the [[species]] {{iChilopoda wikiphiliae}} and likely resides in the [[UK|United Kingdom]]. Kip is a [[Wikipedian]], often editing for the site to prevent [[vandalism|Vandalism on Wikipedia]] and other undesirable articles. Kip is well-educated, with [[degrees|college degree]] in [[physics]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], and [[veterinary medicine]], but is also [[unemployed|Unemployment in the United Kingdom]] and on [[Jobseeker's Allowance]]. He is a [[vegetarian]] who likes to have [[lollipops|lollipop]], a cup of [[mate|mate (drink)]] occasionally, and rarely [[steak]]. Kip also has a [[habit]] of talking in the [[third person]] (similar to how Wikipedia's articles are written). While he is said to have many legs, Kip prefers to be depicted with 6--8 at a time. Despite resembling an [[ant]] when depicted with fewer legs, Kip believes the debate between ants and centipedes is [[speciesist|speciesism]] (but he's also tempted to [[blame Canada|Anti-Canadian sentiment]] for it).</div>
