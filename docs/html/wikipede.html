      <h1>Wikipede</h1>
      <div>For the YouTube video, see Wikipede (video).<br>Wikipede, Kip the Wikipede, or simply Kip, was a proposed centipede mascot for Wikipedia in 2006. Despite getting the most votes of support at 45, Wikipe-tan with ~31 votes became more synonymous as the mascot. The traits of the character were collectively made on the Wikimedia article for Wikipede.

Wikipede is made up of multiple blobby-green segments, with a pair of stubby yellow feet at the bottom, blue segmented antennae at the top, eyes covered by thick glasses, and several arms. The number of arms is variable, with as few as 4. The arms are off-white with the hands resembling yellow gloves.

Wikipede, or less formally Kip, is a member of the species Chilopoda wikiphiliae and likely resides in the UK. Kip is a Wikipedian, often editing for the site to prevent vandalism and other undesirable articles. Kip is well-educated, with degrees in physics, philosophy, history, and veterinary medicine, but is also unemployed and on Jobseeker's Allowance. He is a vegetarian who likes to have lollipops, a cup of mate occasionally, and rarely steak. Kip also has a habit of talking in the third person (similar to how Wikipedia's articles are written). While he is said to have many legs, Kip prefers to be depicted with 6--8 at a time. Despite resembling an ant when depicted with fewer legs, Kip believes the debate between ants and centipedes is speciesist (but he's also tempted to blame Canada for it).</div>
