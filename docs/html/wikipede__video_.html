      <h1>Wikipede (video)</h1>
      <div>"Wikipede" is a YouTube video made by Rohan Mehra on July 5, 2012, with a simple animation of a worm/centipede comprised of the logo of Wikipedia. The video is not related to the proposed mascot for Wikipedia, Wikipede. The video is 10 seconds in length.&pThe text "Wikipede" is centered towards the top of the video. A centipede comprised of 16 Wikipedia logos with drawn-on eyes, antennae, and a smile moves along the video in a wave. Each step of the animation removes the back segment, adds a front segment, and moves the face to the front segment.</div>
