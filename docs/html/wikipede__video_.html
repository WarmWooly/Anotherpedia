The video is not related to the proposed Mascots for Wikipedia, Wikipede. The video is 10 second in length.&pThe text "Wikipede" is centered towards the top of the video. A centipede comprised of 16 Wikipedia logos with drawn-on eyes, antennae, and a smile moves along the video in a wave. Each step of the animation removes the back segment, adds a front segment, and moves the face to the front segment.</div>
