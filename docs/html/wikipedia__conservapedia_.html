  <h1>Wikipedia (Conservapedia)</h1>
  <div><<shortArticle about Wikipedia on Conservapediashort>><<img(src=git/wikipedia conservapedia.png(cap=A [[screenshot]] from the page.img>>{{tThis page is a summary of the <<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com/Wikipedia(text=article on Conservapedialink>>.}}&sp{{bWikipedia}} is an article on [[Conservapedia]] which is used for Conservapedia users to understand the [[history|history of Wikipedia]] of [[Wikipedia]]. The main problem of the article is that most of the [[statistics]] used to show that Wikipedia is declining and unreliable is over a [[decade]] old, not accounting for how modern Wikipedia has become one of the largest [[websites|website]] in the [[world|Earth]].<<hrArticle informationhr>>This article was created on March 12, 2007‎, originally as a redirect to [[Examples of Bias in Wikipedia|Examples of Bias in Wikipedia (Conservapedia)]]. On the same day, the page was given its first line of text, which was:<<quoWikipedia is free online attempt to combine human knowledge into one concise source. It is non biased.quo>>This vandalism was quickly reverted. The article, <<asofMarch 2024>>, has 139 cited sources.<<hrArticle contentshr>><<hr2Openinghr2>>The opening of the article goes over basic [[information]] and perceived [[liberal bias|liberal bias in Wikipedia]] of Wikipedia. They make many [[claims|claim]] throughout the opening, such as that Wikipedia potentially hosts content which [[sympathize with Nazis|Nazi sympathy]], that it discredits [[Conservative|Conservative (American politics)]] [[organizations|political organization]], and introducing liberal bias into articles regarding [[politics|American politics]].<<hr2Continuing loss of influencehr2>>This section quickly covers the decrease of [[influence|Wikipedia's influence]] compared to [[Siri]], [[Google|Google search]], and [[Quora]]. It notes a drop in activity and usage on Wikipedia between 2012 and 2013.<<hr2Unreliability of Wikipediahr2>>This section pushes the claim that Wikipedia is [[unreliable|Reliability of Wikipedia]] because of the nature of the open-editing system put in place on the website. Supposedly, information can be removed at any time for any reason, regardless of quality, only allowing the "majority of editors" the most voice on Wikipedia. They also claim that Wikipedia has paid [[public relations]] officials to constantly monitor and edit articles on the site, that Wikipedia is overly liberal to the point of affecting the quality of the site, that a substantial percentage of articles have some information which is unreliable or [[incorrect]], Wikipedia's [[sources|source]] are great for [[research]], that millions of articles are not [[educationally substantial|educational substance]], and that Wikipedia has fluctuating [[quality|Quality of Wikipedia]].<<hr2Originshr2>>The origins of Wikipedia are heavily [[summarized|summary]], where [[Bomis, Inc.]] was originally hosting the [[servers|Wikipedia servers]] for Wikipedia<<note(content=The article also adds the detail that Bomis, Inc. was hosting inappropriate mature content on the site, but does not develop on this point further in the origins of Wikipedia.(text=noteCountnote>> until the owner was given a [[lawsuit]] they lost, in which [[Jimbo Wales]] created the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to save the project. They also note that [[MediaWiki]] is what hosts both Wikipedia and Conservapedia and that Wikipedia recruits liberals.<<hr2Leftist biashr2>>Wikipedia is said to have a liberal bias in which they silence [[minority opinions|minority opinion]] using [[undue weight]] as a shield against [[criticism]]. Wikipedia was said to be founded on [[counterculture]], where [[altruism]] was pushed aside for [[political|political bias]] and [[social bias]].<<note(content=A picture of Peter Singer is provided alongside information such as that he supports [[infanticide]], despite not being relevant to the section.(text=noteCountnote>> The [[Wikimedia Commons]] editing software [[Commonist|Commonist (Wikimedia Commons)]] (a play on {{i[[Communist]]}}) uses the [[hammer and sickle]] as its [[logo]], being embedded into Commonist.<<hr3Researchhr3>>This subsection goes over an article published by [[David Swindle]] on {{i[[FrontPage Magazine]]}} discussing how the political left took over Wikipedia. It references how [[Ann Coulter]], [[Michael Moore]], and other political figures have disproportionate amounts of content on [[criticism]] and [[controversy]].<<hr3Talk Pageshr3>>This following subsection shortly says that Wikipedia's [[talk pages|Talk page (Wikipedia)]] clearly demonstrate a left-winged bias on the site. It gives an example of editors objecting to the authors of an article about the [[Barcelona May Days]] and how the content on the page went against [[Stalinism]].<<hr2Purported "Tertiary" Source and Arbitrary Standardshr2>>Wikipedia is said to be a tertiary source, in which it relies on [[hearsay]], disapproves of using [[logic]] and recent insights on issues and topics, and the immovability of [[orthodoxy]] pre-established on the site. They bring up how a [[Wikipedian]] named [[Yeoberry]] was unable to add information he gathered from [[historical documents|historical document]] and a recent [[academic paper]] on the article regarding [[icons|icon]] and how he was banned after supposedly engaging in actions related to [[edit warring]] and challenging the inconsistency of Wikipedia's standards. Editors are said to weaponize [[conflict of interest]] and [[fringe]] information on [[religious|religious topic]] or [[political topics|political topic]]. Conservapedia states that encyclopedias before Wikipedia were only written by [[experts|expert]], but on Wikipedia [[expertise]] on a [[subject]] is seen as negative.<<hr2Economicshr2>>This section starts by describing how Wikipedia is [[non-profit]] but that Wikia (now [[Fandom|Fandom (website)]]) is [[for-profit]] and that the co-founder of Wikipedia made Wikia favored more by removing [[nofollow]] tags on Wikia [[links|hyperlink]]. Supposedly, despite Wikipedia asking for [[donations|donation]], Wikipedia makes a surplus in profit to keep the site running.<<note(content=Conservapedia also asks for donations, despite making between 5 to 10 million a year. Conservapedia has a profit surplus to keep their site running without a problem, yet have a more obtrusive donate button.(text=noteCountnote>> They also bring up how [[WikiExperts]] can be used to pay for experts to create articles on Wikipedia, which is said to use Wikipedia's [[trademark]] despite not being affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation.<<hr2Scandals and declinehr2>>The section starts with saying that since 2007 there has been a major decline in user accounts on Wikipedia, a steady decline in edits was observed, and that Wikipedia's activity had peaked. It discusses a [[hoax]] of the Wikimedia Foundation propping up normal people as experts, [[persuading|persuasion]] [[college professors|college professor]] to allow Wikipedia to be used as a source, and Wikipedia using the [[slogan]] "OMG! Wikipedia is gone! I’ll flunk my exams!" It is also said that the [[Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee (Wikipedia)]] elections in 2012 on Wikipedia were not getting as many votes because of the [[invasion of privacy]] caused by Wikipedia checking for [[sockpuppet accounts|sockpuppet account]].<<hr2Shane Fitzgerald Hoaxhr2>>The [[Shane Fitzgerald Hoax]] was a hoax on Wikipedia when an Irish student [[Shane Fitzgerald]] after attaching a fictional [[quote]] onto the article for [[Maurice Jarre]], stating:<<quo"One could say my life itself has been one long soundtrack. Music was my life, music brought me to life, and music is how I will be remembered long after I leave this life. When I die there will be a final waltz playing in my head, that only I can hear."quo>>[[Jounalists|Journalist]] took directly from Wikipedia and cited the quote in news articles when Maurice Jarre died, only removing them after Fitzgerald confessed to fabricating the quote for Jarre.<<hr2False claim about Brent Bozellhr2>>[[Brent Bozell]], the founder of the [[Media Research Center]] and the [[Parents Television Council]], described in early 2007 how a [[colleague]] of his, [[Bernie Goldberg]], felt [[upset]] that his article on Wikipedia made it out that Bozell disliked Goldberg. Bozell defended himself by stating a quote made against Goldberg was fabricated.<<note(content=<<AsofMarch 2024>>, Wikipedia's page on Bernie Goldberg does not have the offending quote and instead has one from Bozell praising Goldberg for a book he wrote.(text=noteCountnote>> Bozell then goes over how Conservapedia has dozens of [[allegations|allegation]] against Wikipedia about its liberal bias.<<hr2Rewriting its own historyhr2>>This section goes over how [[Larry Sanger]] and [[Jimmy Wales]] supposedly conflicted with each other on the importance of each other's roles in the [[founding of Wikipedia]]. They cite that Wales edited his own article to personally tone down the influence of Sanger until reverting it in 2005 after being found out by a [[blogger]].<<hr2Seigenthaler scandalhr2>>In late 2005, [[John Seigenthaler Sr.]] contacted Jimmy Wales to discuss how content on his [[biographical|biography]] article was [[false]], in which a [[Wikipedia Administrator]] [[Essjay]] was send out to correct the issue. The content added regarded how Seigenthaler was potentially involved with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and that he went to the [[Soviet Union]] for over a decade. Wikipedia stated that they would be unable to track down the offending editor, but the [[activist]] [[Daniel Brandt]] identified the editor.<<hr3CNN interviewhr3>>After a 2005 broadcast of [[CNN]] between Seigenthaler and Wales, a CNN moderator [[Kyra Phillips]] told Wales that her article, like Seigenthaler and others, had false content. Wales responded by saying that Wikipedia was always evolving and that Phillips was able to edit her page herself. Brandt (who also objected to content on his page) and Phillips supposedly were unable to edit their pages because of objections from Wikipedia admins. Seigenthaler and [[Brian Lamb]] discussed how pages about prominent [[political figures|political figure]] got [[vandalized|Vandalization on Wikipedia]]. In late 2006, a section on [[Tom DeLay's|Tom DeLay]] article was changed to "Grand Dragon of the [[Republican Party]]." Seigenthaler goes over his own troubles with vandalism, where he was called a [[Nazi]] and that they changed his photo to [[Adolf Hitler]].<<hr3Accountability and Section 230hr3>>Seigenthaler criticized [[Section 230]] of the [[Communications Decency Act of 1996]] where [[internet service providers|internet service provider]] are not able to be [[sued|suing]] for [[deformation]]. Despite what Wales said to Lamb regarding how [[misinformation]] is swiftly removed from articles, Seigenthaler had false content in his article for five [[months|month]]. In the case {{i[[Zeran v. America Online, Inc.]]}}, [[Kenneth Zeran]] sued AOL for hosting defamatory messages against him, which AOL won because of Section 230.<<note(content=AOL was not responsible for creating the content it hosted, and thusly is not the one saying the defamatory messages. The person at fault would be the person who posted the content and not the host. Section 230 was added to allow websites that host content to not fear that content posted by a third party would leave them liable.(text=noteCountnote>> The subsection then states that [[free speech]] in the [[United States]] would not be prosecuted online, even if the content is [[illegal]].<<hr3Essjay given oversighthr3>>During the [[Essjay controversy]], Essjay told a college professor to allow her students to use Wikipedia as a source and complained that Seigenthaler's complaints caused negative publicity. Other admins stated that Seigenthaler could remove the content himself, but doing so would be a conflict of interest. Despite the negative publicity, [[all publicity is good publicity]], giving Wikipedia more visits by curious onlookers to the issue. The subsection describes misinformation present on the Seigenthaler controversy (now [[Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident]]) which has since been removed. Supposedly, admins and editors had many sockpuppets and that keeping editors anonymous was of great importance to the Wikimedia Foundation.<<hr2Brandt / Berlet feudhr2>>In 1991, [[Daniel Brandt]], the founder of [[Namebase]] and [[Wikipedia Watch]], removed [[Chip Berlet]] from his [[Board of Advisors]] because of Berlet's [[disapproval]] of [[L. Fletcher Prouty]], a [[retired|retirement]] [[colonel]] of the [[United States Air Force]]. The [[Daniel Brant controversy]] was started in 2005 when an article about Brandt was created using information from Berlet as a negative source. A Wikipedia admin didn't remove content from Brandt on Berlet because they felt that even if it wasn't [[credible|credibility]], they felt that there had to be something negative on Berlet.<<hr3Biographies of living personshr3>>The [[Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons]] policy was supposedly created because of the Daniel Brant controversy, where Brandt wanted his entry removed. Brandt wanted [[accountability]] of the admins who kept Berlet as a source against Brandt because of Berlet's [[political agenda]]. An entry from [[WikiTruth]] is cited as it describes how Wikipedia despises Brandt because he [[researches|research]]. Admins are still able to edit articles regarding living persons without a method to force Wikipedia to make changes in the case that the articles are [[liable]].<<hr2The Wordbomb Sagahr2>>[[Gary Weiss]] had supposedly edit articles regarding [[Overstock.com]] about his views of the company. Weiss was against Overstock and their [[CEO]] [[Patrick Byrne]] because of their [[naked short selling]]. In 2006, [[Judd Bagley]] had attempted to edit articles in favor of Overstock.com before being stopped by Wikipedia admins. Bagley became Overstock's Director of Communications and tried to expose Weiss that he was editing articles under the name "Mantanmoreland". Weiss then created an article about himself and was found to be using an [[IP|Internet Protocol]] that was also used by the [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]]. The admins sided with Weiss on the matter and used Bagley as a Wikipedia "boogeyman". Editors who agreed with Overstock's complaints were banned as if they were [[proxies|proxy]] of Bagley.<<hr2Michael Moorehr2>>The website [[MichaelMoore.com]] posted a [[photo]] of a Wikipedia editor who edited the page {{i[[SiCKO]]}}<<note(content=Michael Moore was the director of {{iSiCKO}}.(text=noteCountnote>> because of their dissatisfaction with the edits. Wikipedia users did not like how [[Michael Moore's|Michael Moore]] website showed the face of an editor of Wikipedia because they disagreed with the editor's edits. Links to the editor's account were removed from Wikipedia to protect the editor. The editor responded to the post that was urging users to attack the editor by calling users of MichaelMoore.com a [[conservative think tank]].<<hr2Sinbad hoaxhr2>>In 2007, an edit claiming the death of [[Sinbad]] was made on the Wikipedia page, despite being false.<<hr2Robert Clark Young revenge editshr2>>Between 2006 and 2013, the [[author]] [[Robert Clark Young]] under the [[username]] "Qworty" made 13,000 edits. He created sockpuppet accounts, attacked other authors, and bolstered his own article. During the period, Qworty denied the connection for being Young. After [[salon.com]] posted about the connection between Young and Qworty, he was banned from Wikipedia.<<hr2Rutgers-Ivy League hoaxhr2>>There was an article on Wikipedia which stated that [[Rutgers University]] was invited to the [[Ivy League]] and that Rutgers denied it. The {{i[[Daily News]]}} posted an article on this information. The [[hoax]] has since been removed.<<hr2Barbara Bauer vs. Wikimedia Foundationhr2>>The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] was a [[defendant]] in a case brought up by [[Barbara Bauer]] because an article called her the "dumbest" literary agent. This was protected under Section 230 because the Wikimedia Foundation did not write the offending text.<<hr2GFDL License Issuehr2>>This section claims that Wikipedia's deletion of articles, including edit history, violated the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) version 1.2. Conservapedia interprets the license to mean that deletion of articles would directly violate the GFDL. Since mid-2009, articles on Wikipedia is under the GDFL and the [[Creative Commons]] [[CC-BY-SA 3.0]].<<hr2Censorshiphr2>>According to Conservapedia, Wikipedia engages in [[censorship]] (mainly relating to [[politics]], [[COVID-19]], [[global warming]], and [[non-binary]] people). This censorship is in favor of the far-left.<<hr2Cyberbullyinghr2>>This section describes [[cyberbullying on Wikipedia]], such as a [[teenager]] who was [[arrested|arrest]] for making threat against a [[school]] in 2006 and when an editor threatened an Asian student in 2008. [[María Sefidari]], the former Chair of the [[Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees]] is supposedly in a [[romantic relationship]] with [[Laura Hale]], an editor on Wikipedia. Allegedly, Hale and a male editor feuded, and Hale's relationship with Sefidari allowed Hale to suspend the male editor's account for a year. A Wikipedia admin lifted the block on the editor's account, but it was soon reverted and the admin was stripped of is privileges.<<hr2Wikipedia on bestialityhr2>>This section starts by covering how [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] are [[atheists|atheist]] before describing that the Wikipedia article on [[zoophilia]] and [[bestiality]] has a section dedicated to arguments for the act.<<note(content=Conservapedia closely ties atheism, belief in evolution, and bestiality together, with multiple articles on the matter. Their repetition of Wales and Sanger being atheist is to have the readers believe that they practice bestiality themselves, which is false.(text=noteCountnote>><<hr2Trademarks and domain nameshr2>>The Wikimedia Foundation uses [[trademarks|trademark]] and [[domain names|domain name]] to try and control the [[brand of Wikipedia]]. This includes Wikia (now [[Fandom|Fandom (website)]]) purchasing domains related to [[WikiLeaks]] for "brand protection", despite [[wiki]] being a type of website.<<hr2Humorous quotes concerning Wikipediahr2>>This section has little importance regarding Wikipedia. There are a total of five [[quotes|quote]], all which paint Wikipedia in a negative light while being [[humorous]] in some manner.<<hr2Unbiased editor recruitmenthr2>>In 2012, the Wikimedia Foundation paid [[Gregory Varnum]] and others to go to the [[Creating Change Conference]], a [[conference]] regarding [[LGBTQ rights]] and [[acceptance|LGBTQ acceptance]]. This was to get editors from more diverse and inclusive backgrounds. There has not been a similar outreach in conservative conferences. [[Sarah Stierch]] was an editor on Wikipedia until she left where she would go onto monitor the [[email]] [[gendergap@lists.wikimedia.org]]. In 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation hired Stierch as a [[Community Fellow|Community Fellow (Wikimedia Foundation)]] for the [[Teahouse Pilot Project]] to introduce new editors to the site. In 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] and [[Wikimedia DC]] encouraged members of [[Congress|United States Congress]] to update articles related to [[pending legislation]] and [[policy issues]].<<hr2Flaws in governance structurehr2>>Conservapedia feels that the largest [[problem in Wikipedia|Problems with Wikipedia]] is how [[Jimmy Wales]] supposedly acts as the leader of Wikipedia and that only him and his friends do significant edits and article creation. [[Aaron Swartz]], a [[programmer]] and [[activist]], said that thousands of users all work on pages on Wikipedia, refuting Wales' statement.<<note(content=It also mentions that Swartz committed [[suicide]], which is not relevant to the section.(text=noteCountnote>> Unlike other [[encyclopedias|encyclopedia]] that have a single [[editor in chief]], Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee, which Conservapedia considers slow to action and slower to resolution. They partially blame the [[personality]] of Wales on the governance of Wikipedia being poor. Recently, fundraising for the Wikimedia Foundation went from a per-[[country]] basis to a single [[pool|monetary pool]] in which countries need to ask to appropriate funds. Overall, the [[Wikipedia community]] is said to have little to no power over spending or other decisions made by Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.<<hr2Core policieshr2>>Conservapedia covers how Wikipedia poorly enforces their [[core policies|core policy]] of [[Neutral Point of View|Neutral Point of View (Wikipedia)]], [[Verifiability|Verifiability (Wikipedia)]], and [[No Original Research|No Original Research (Wikipedia)]]. They especially noticed this in regards to topics aligned with [[atheism]].<<hr2Hunter Bidenhr2>>This section goes over how [[Hunter Biden]], the son of [[Joe Biden]], allegedly paid a [[PR firm|public relations firm]] to make his article on Wikipedia look better. Since then, there has been an article created on Wikipedia on the [[Hunter Biden laptop controversy]].</div>
