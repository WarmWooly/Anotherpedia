      <h1>Wikipedia (Conservapedia)</h1>
      <div>This page is a summary of the <<link(src=https://www.conservapedia.com/Wikipedia(text=article on Conservapedialink>>.&spWikipedia is an article on Conservapedia which is used for Conservapedia users to understand the history of Wikipedia. The main problem of the article is that most of the statistics used to show that Wikipedia is declining and unreliable is over a decade old, not accounting for how modern Wikipedia has become one of the largest websites in the world.

This article was created on March 12, 2007‎, originally as a redirect to Examples of Bias in Wikipedia. On the same day, the page was given its first line of text, which was:This vandalism was quickly reverted. The article, <<asofMarch 2024>>, has 139 cited sources.



The opening of the article goes over basic information and perceived liberal bias of Wikipedia. They make many claims throughout the opening, such as that Wikipedia potentially hosts content which sympathize with Nazis, that it discredits Conservative organizations, and introducing liberal bias into articles regarding politics.

This section quickly covers the decrease of influence compared to Siri, Google, and Quora. It notes a drop in activity and usage on Wikipedia between 2012 and 2013.

This section pushes the claim that Wikipedia is unreliable because of the nature of the open-editing system put in place on the website. Supposedly, information can be removed at any time for any reason, regardless of quality, only allowing the "majority of editors" the most voice on Wikipedia. They also claim that Wikipedia has paid public relations officials to constantly monitor and edit articles on the site, that Wikipedia is overly liberal to the point of affecting the quality of the site, that a substantial percentage of articles have some information which is unreliable or incorrect, Wikipedia's sources are great for research, that millions of articles are not educationally substantial, and that Wikipedia has fluctuating quality.

The origins of Wikipedia are heavily summarized, where Bomis, Inc. was originally hosting the servers for Wikipedia<<note(content=The article also adds the detail that Bomis, Inc. was hosting inappropriate mature content on the site, but does not develop on this point further in the origins of Wikipedia.(text=noteCountnote>> until the owner was given a lawsuit they lost, in which Jimbo Wales created the Wikimedia Foundation to save the project. They also note that MediaWiki is what hosts both Wikipedia and Conservapedia and that Wikipedia recruits liberals.

Wikipedia is said to have a liberal bias in which they silence minority opinions using undue weight as a shield against criticism. Wikipedia was said to be founded on counterculture, where altruism was pushed aside for political and social bias.<<note(content=A picture of Peter Singer is provided alongside information such as that he supports infanticide, despite not being relevant to the section.(text=noteCountnote>> The Wikimedia Commons editing software Commonist (a play on Communist) uses the hammer and sickle as its logo, being embedded into Commonist.

This subsection goes over an article published by David Swindle on FrontPage Magazine discussing how the political left took over Wikipedia. It references how Ann Coulter, Michael Moore, and other political figures have disproportionate amounts of content on criticism and controversy.

This following subsection shortly says that Wikipedia's talk pages clearly demonstrate a left-winged bias on the site. It gives an example of editors objecting to the authors of an article about the Barcelona May Days and how the content on the page went against Stalinism.

Wikipedia is said to be a tertiary source, in which it relies on hearsay, disapproves of using logic and recent insights on issues and topics, and the immovability of orthodoxy pre-established on the site. They bring up how a Wikipedian named Yeoberry was unable to add information he gathered from historical documents and a recent academic paper on the article regarding icons and how he was banned after supposedly engaging in actions related to edit warring and challenging the inconsistency of Wikipedia's standards. Editors are said to weaponize conflict of interest and fringe information on religious or political topics. Conservapedia states that encyclopedias before Wikipedia were only written by experts, but on Wikipedia expertise on a subject is seen as negative.

This section starts by describing how Wikipedia is non-profit but that Wikia (now Fandom) is for-profit and that the co-founder of Wikipedia made Wikia favored more by removing nofollow tags on Wikia links. Supposedly, despite Wikipedia asking for donations, Wikipedia makes a surplus in profit to keep the site running.<<note(content=Conservapedia also asks for donations, despite making between 5 to 10 million a year. Conservapedia has a profit surplus to keep their site running without a problem, yet have a more obtrusive donate button.(text=noteCountnote>> They also bring up how WikiExperts can be used to pay for experts to create articles on Wikipedia, which is said to use Wikipedia's trademark despite not being affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation.

The section starts with saying that since 2007 there has been a major decline in user accounts on Wikipedia, a steady decline in edits was observed, and that Wikipedia's activity had peaked. It discusses a hoax of the Wikimedia Foundation propping up normal people as experts, persuading college professors to allow Wikipedia to be used as a source, and Wikipedia using the slogan "OMG! Wikipedia is gone! I’ll flunk my exams!" It is also said that the Arbitration Committee elections in 2012 on Wikipedia were not getting as many votes because of the invasion of privacy caused by Wikipedia checking for sockpuppet accounts.

The Shane Fitzgerald Hoax was a hoax on Wikipedia when an Irish student Shane Fitzgerald after attaching a fictional quote onto the article for Maurice Jarre, stating:Jounalists took directly from Wikipedia and cited the quote in news articles when Maurice Jarre died, only removing them after Fitzgerald confessed to fabricating the quote for Jarre.

Brent Bozell, the founder of the Media Research Center and the Parents Television Council, described in early 2007 how a colleague of his, Bernie Goldberg, felt upset that his article on Wikipedia made it out that Bozell disliked Goldberg. Bozell defended himself by stating a quote made against Goldberg was fabricated.<<note(content=<<AsofMarch 2024>>, Wikipedia's page on Bernie Goldberg does not have the offending quote and instead has one from Bozell praising Goldberg for a book he wrote.(text=noteCountnote>> Bozell then goes over how Conservapedia has dozens of allegations against Wikipedia about its liberal bias.

This section goes over how Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales supposedly conflicted with each other on the importance of each other's roles in the founding of Wikipedia. They cite that Wales edited his own article to personally tone down the influence of Sanger until reverting it in 2005 after being found out by a blogger.

In late 2005, John Seigenthaler Sr. contacted Jimmy Wales to discuss how content on his biographical article was false, in which a Wikipedia Administrator Essjay was send out to correct the issue. The content added regarded how Seigenthaler was potentially involved with the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that he went to the Soviet Union for over a decade. Wikipedia stated that they would be unable to track down the offending editor, but the activist Daniel Brandt identified the editor.

After a 2005 broadcast of CNN between Seigenthaler and Wales, a CNN moderator Kyra Phillips told Wales that her article, like Seigenthaler and others, had false content. Wales responded by saying that Wikipedia was always evolving and that Phillips was able to edit her page herself. Brandt (who also objected to content on his page) and Phillips supposedly were unable to edit their pages because of objections from Wikipedia admins. Seigenthaler and Brian Lamb discussed how pages about prominent political figures got vandalized. In late 2006, a section on Tom DeLay's article was changed to "Grand Dragon of the Republican Party." Seigenthaler goes over his own troubles with vandalism, where he was called a Nazi and that they changed his photo to Adolf Hitler.

Seigenthaler criticized Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 where internet service providers are not able to be sued for deformation. Despite what Wales said to Lamb regarding how misinformation is swiftly removed from articles, Seigenthaler had false content in his article for five months. In the case Zeran v. America Online, Inc., Kenneth Zeran sued AOL for hosting defamatory messages against him, which AOL won because of Section 230.<<note(content=AOL was not responsible for creating the content it hosted, and thusly is not the one saying the defamatory messages. The person at fault would be the person who posted the content and not the host. Section 230 was added to allow websites that host content to not fear that content posted by a third party would leave them liable.(text=noteCountnote>> The subsection then states that free speech in the United States would not be prosecuted online, even if the content is illegal.

During the Essjay controversy, Essjay told a college professor to allow her students to use Wikipedia as a source and complained that Seigenthaler's complaints caused negative publicity. Other admins stated that Seigenthaler could remove the content himself, but doing so would be a conflict of interest. Despite the negative publicity, all publicity is good publicity, giving Wikipedia more visits by curious onlookers to the issue. The subsection describes misinformation present on the Seigenthaler controversy (now Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident) which has since been removed. Supposedly, admins and editors had many sockpuppets and that keeping editors anonymous was of great importance to the Wikimedia Foundation.

In 1991, Daniel Brandt, the founder of Namebase and Wikipedia Watch, removed Chip Berlet from his Board of Advisors because of Berlet's disapproval of L. Fletcher Prouty, a retired colonel of the United States Air Force. The Daniel Brant controversy was started in 2005 when an article about Brandt was created using information from Berlet as a negative source. A Wikipedia admin didn't remove content from Brandt on Berlet because they felt that even if it wasn't credible, they felt that there had to be something negative on Berlet.

The Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons policy was supposedly created because of the Daniel Brant controversy, where Brandt wanted his entry removed. Brandt wanted accountability of the admins who kept Berlet as a source against Brandt because of Berlet's political agenda. An entry from WikiTruth is cited as it describes how Wikipedia despises Brandt because he researches. Admins are still able to edit articles regarding living persons without a method to force Wikipedia to make changes in the case that the articles are liable.

Gary Weiss had supposedly edit articles regarding Overstock.com about his views of the company. Weiss was against Overstock and their CEO Patrick Byrne because of their naked short selling. In 2006, Judd Bagley had attempted to edit articles in favor of Overstock.com before being stopped by Wikipedia admins. Bagley became Overstock's Director of Communications and tried to expose Weiss that he was editing articles under the name "Mantanmoreland". Weiss then created an article about himself and was found to be using an IP that was also used by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. The admins sided with Weiss on the matter and used Bagley as a Wikipedia "boogeyman". Editors who agreed with Overstock's complaints were banned as if they were proxies of Bagley.

The website MichaelMoore.com posted a photo of a Wikipedia editor who edited the page SiCKO<<note(content=Michael Moore was the director of SiCKO.(text=noteCountnote>> because of their dissatisfaction with the edits. Wikipedia users did not like how Michael Moore's website showed the face of an editor of Wikipedia because they disagreed with the editor's edits. Links to the editor's account were removed from Wikipedia to protect the editor. The editor responded to the post that was urging users to attack the editor by calling users of MichaelMoore.com a conservative think tank.

In 2007, an edit claiming the death of Sinbad was made on the Wikipedia page, despite being false.

Between 2006 and 2013, the author Robert Clark Young under the username "Qworty" made 13,000 edits. He created sockpuppet accounts, attacked other authors, and bolstered his own article. During the period, Qworty denied the connection for being Young. After salon.com posted about the connection between Young and Qworty, he was banned from Wikipedia.

There was an article on Wikipedia which stated that Rutgers University was invited to the Ivy League and that Rutgers denied it. The Daily News posted an article on this information. The hoax has since been removed.

The Wikimedia Foundation was a defendant in a case brought up by Barbara Bauer because an article called her the "dumbest" literary agent. This was protected under Section 230 because the Wikimedia Foundation did not write the offending text.

This section claims that Wikipedia's deletion of articles, including edit history, violated the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) version 1.2. Conservapedia interprets the license to mean that deletion of articles would directly violate the GFDL. Since mid-2009, articles on Wikipedia is under the GDFL and the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 3.0.

According to Conservapedia, Wikipedia engages in censorship (mainly relating to politics, COVID-19, global warming, and non-binary people). This censorship is in favor of the far-left.

This section describes cyberbullying on Wikipedia, such as a teenager who was arrested for making threat against a school in 2006 and when an editor threatened an Asian student in 2008. María Sefidari, the former Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees is supposedly in a romantic relationship with Laura Hale, an editor on Wikipedia. Allegedly, Hale and a male editor feuded, and Hale's relationship with Sefidari allowed Hale to suspend the male editor's account for a year. A Wikipedia admin lifted the block on the editor's account, but it was soon reverted and the admin was stripped of is privileges.

This section starts by covering how Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger are atheists before describing that the Wikipedia article on zoophilia and bestiality has a section dedicated to arguments for the act.<<note(content=Conservapedia closely ties atheism, belief in evolution, and bestiality together, with multiple articles on the matter. Their repetition of Wales and Sanger being atheist is to have the readers believe that they practice bestiality themselves, which is false.(text=noteCountnote>>

The Wikimedia Foundation uses trademarks and domain names to try and control the brand of Wikipedia. This includes Wikia (now Fandom) purchasing domains related to WikiLeaks for "brand protection", despite wiki being a type of website.

This section has little importance regarding Wikipedia. There are a total of five quotes, all which paint Wikipedia in a negative light while being humorous in some manner.

In 2012, the Wikimedia Foundation paid Gregory Varnum and others to go to the Creating Change Conference, a conference regarding LGBTQ rights and acceptance. This was to get editors from more diverse and inclusive backgrounds. There has not been a similar outreach in conservative conferences. Sarah Stierch was an editor on Wikipedia until she left where she would go onto monitor the email gendergap@lists.wikimedia.org. In 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation hired Stierch as a Community Fellow for the Teahouse Pilot Project to introduce new editors to the site. In 2014, the Cato Institute and Wikimedia DC encouraged members of Congress to update articles related to pending legislation and policy issues.

Conservapedia feels that the largest problem in Wikipedia is how Jimmy Wales supposedly acts as the leader of Wikipedia and that only him and his friends do significant edits and article creation. Aaron Swartz, a programmer and activist, said that thousands of users all work on pages on Wikipedia, refuting Wales' statement.<<note(content=It also mentions that Swartz committed suicide, which is not relevant to the section.(text=noteCountnote>> Unlike other encyclopedias that have a single editor in chief, Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee, which Conservapedia considers slow to action and slower to resolution. They partially blame the personality of Wales on the governance of Wikipedia being poor. Recently, fundraising for the Wikimedia Foundation went from a per-country basis to a single pool in which countries need to ask to appropriate funds. Overall, the Wikipedia community is said to have little to no power over spending or other decisions made by Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.

Conservapedia covers how Wikipedia poorly enforces their core policies of Neutral Point of View, Verifiability, and No Original Research. They especially noticed this in regards to topics aligned with atheism.

This section goes over how Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, allegedly paid a PR firm to make his article on Wikipedia look better. Since then, there has been an article created on Wikipedia on the Hunter Biden laptop controversy.</div>
