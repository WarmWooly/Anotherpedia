      <h1>Wikipedia's article movement for Gaza war</h1>
      <div>On Wikipedia, there has been a debate since October 7, 2023, regarding the name for the <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war(text=articlelink>> Gaza war.
The following is a timeline of all the movement changes for the article "Gaza war":<<tableDate|Name|Information||Oct 7, 2023|2023 Hamas attack on Israel|Original name||Oct 7, 2023|October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel|Moved by Ainty Painty||Oct 7, 2023|October 2023 Gaza−Israel conflict|Moved by Iskandar323||Oct 10, 2023|2023 Israel–Hamas war|Move request passed||Jan 19, 2024|Israel–Hamas war|Move request passed||Jan 27, 2025|Gaza war|Move request passedtable>>
For the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_4#Requested_move_7_October_2023(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 4 § Requested move 7 October 2023link>>.&spThe original title for the article was "2023 Hamas attack on Israel", which was accurate for the immediate time when the article was made. It then went to "October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel" and "October 2023 Gaza−Israel conflict" before the first move discussion was made. As the scope of the conflict broadened into a full-out war, a request was made to change the name to fit the new scale.
These are some of the names proposed during the discussion and a short overview of why they were considered or argued against.<<tableProposed name|Reasoning||2023 Palestine--Israel war|The scale of the conflict had grown to affect multiple parts of Palestine, even those not directly related to Hamas.||2023 Gaza--Israel war|With a similar case to the previous, highlighting the aspect of the Gaza Strip compared to the entire country of Palestine. This was much more popular because the majority of the area affected has been in the Gaza Strip.||2023 Arab--Israel war|This title pushes more involvement onto Arabs rather than a single location. This quickly got shot down for being too broad of a group to pin the actions of the war on, while not highlighting the true nature of the conflict.||Hamas invasion of Israel|Following the title "Russian invasion of Ukraine", this title would show Hamas as an invading force into Israel. It was quickly rejected for being biased against Hamas. Hamas also isn't a country and isn't the only opposing force. "2022 al-Shabaab invasion of Ethiopia" was highlighted as a non-country example, but overall the idea was overturned.||Operation Al-Aqsa Flood|This related to the operation carried out. It did not garner support, but it redirects to 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.||2023 Israel-Palestine war|A variation ordering the countries alphabetically.||2023 Gaza war|This title was shorter, but ignored the involvement of Israel and made it seem that the conflict was primarily inside of the Gaza Strip.||2023 Hamas--Israel war|This heightened the conflict to the status of a war, but kept the core belligerents the same. It became widely popular because it didn't alter who was fighting, just the scale of the operation.table>>
In the end, the name was changed to "2023 Israel--Hamas war". This was said to be because the duration would be longer than October, the scale has become to one of a war, most credible sources used "Hamas" and not "Gaza", and Gaza itself is not partaking in the majority of the conflict but rather the group behind it. There was no explanation behind the non-alphabetical ordering of Israel and Hamas, most likely because Israel is a country and would take priority.

This was quickly opposed because despite the inclusion of other military groups, conflict was being split in both Gaza and Israel, and thus to solely focus on Gaza would be misleading. There was no change made to the name of the page.

Arguments were made based on the militant activity conducted by Israel inside Gaza, mainly the bombarding. However, it was not a commonly used term, which split the argument. Because of the lack of consensus, there was no change made to the name of the page.

This was because of the omitted year in publications. It was quickly opposed because it would make it harder to recognize, there were other similar conflicts in the past decades, and because news reports don't use dates in their titles. There was no change made to the name of the page.

There was no real discourse, being closed on December 1st because of a lack of activity. There was no change made to the name of the page.

The following is a list of the 16 options in order of appearance in the initial discussion opening: ::Israel--Hamas war (2023--present)|Israel--Hamas war|2023 Israel--Hamas war|2023--2024 Israel--Hamas war|2023--24 Israel--Hamas war|2023--present Israel--Hamas war|Israel--Hamas war (2023--2024)|Israel--Hamas war (2023--24)|Israel--Gaza war (2023--present)|Israel--Gaza war|Israel--Palestine war (2023--present)|2023--2024 Israel--Palestine war|Israel--Palestine war (2023--2024)|2023 Israel--Palestine war|Israel--Palestine war|2023--24 Isreal--Palestine war::"Israel--Hamas war" quickly became a popular choice because it was more concise and the war had become very prominent, with Israel--Hamas war acting as the common name for it. Despite nearly being closed as having "no consensus", the decision was changed, and "2023 Israel--Hamas war" was moved to "Israel--Hamas war".

Since the start of the war, more people in Gaza have been killed compared to members of Hamas, however, it is still widely reported as the Israel--Hamas war. There had also been contempt among a few editors who were getting tired of the constant move requests. There was a 3 month moratorium on move requests and the discussion has been closed.

There was also support for the title "2023--2024 Israel--Gaza War", however, the main opposition was the lack of change in the conflict over the previous 3 months. Opposition cited the Wikipedia:COMMONNAME and Wikipedia:NPOV (Neutral point of view) to keep "Israel--Hamas war". In the end, no consensus was found and the title remained unchanged.

For the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_45#Move_discussion(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 45 § Move discussionlink>>.&spThis was an informal discussion on moving the page from "Israel--Hamas war" to "Israel--Gaza war" or a similar term. Traction on shifting the focus away from Hamas to a broader war continued from Israel onto the Gaza region and the increased usage amongst reputable sources is what floated the idea, gaining support despite not being an official move discussion.

Those who wanted the change pointed out the increase in credible sources and news outlets using Gaza instead of Hamas when discussing the war. Arguments for the retention of Hamas in the title are that Gaza doesn't have an army fighting Israel, while Hamas does, and that Hamas was the origin of the war.In the end, no consensus was found and the title remained unchanged, which was endorsed in a move review.<<ref(content=link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Move_review/Log/2024_November(text=refCountref>>

Supporters of the move stated that "Gaza war" had become the common name of the war, alongside the trend of only listing major territories or countries in the names of wars (which Hamas is not). Opposition to the change continued to fall back on the claim that reliable sources still used "Israel--Hamas war" and argued that there were other Gaza Wars. In the end, the name was changed to "Gaza war". This move also led the original article "Gaza War" to be moved to "Gaza War (disambiguation)", with "Gaza War" redirecting to "Gaza war".

Arguments against the change stated that the fact that the war is ongoing and that it is more notable than all previous conflicts combined made it reasonable to have it be the de facto "Gaza War" on Wikipedia for the time being, with the option to add the years when the war ended. The article was not moved, and the discussion was closed.</div>
