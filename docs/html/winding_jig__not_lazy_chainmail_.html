      <h1>Winding Jig (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Axe preferred)||Blast resistance|1||Hardness|2||Luminous|No||Transparent|Yes||Flammable|No||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>The winding jig is a block in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail used to turn wires and spools into coils.



Winding jigs naturally generate in winding jig ruins and in a chainmailler home.

The winding jig can be crafted with 3 wooden slabs, 4 sticks, and 1 iron ingot (fill the bottom row with slabs, the left and right columns with sticks, and the top slot with the iron).



Winding jigs require an industrial belt to run, with better belts decreasing the time it takes to wind. Wires and spools can be wound by right-clicking a winding jig with an industrial belt while holding the wire/spool. Different materials will take a varying amount of time to wind corresponding to their malleability (ex. gold is more malleable than iron). The following is a table of how malleable all the wires and spools are:<<tableMaterial|Wire|Spool||Gold|r16|r160||Copper|r32|r320||Rose Gold|r48|r480||Iron|r64|r640||Netherite|r128|r1280||Iron Composite|r512|r5120table>><br>Industrial belts will decrease the amount of winding needed to create coils. While winding a netherite wire with a kelp industrial belt will take 256 right clicks, the same wire with an iron composite chainmail industrial belt will only take 8 right clicks. Here are the speeds for all industrial belts:<<tableBelt|{{bSpeed||Kelp|r1||Leather|r1||Copper|r2||Iron|r3||Gold|r4||Rose Gold|r8||Netherite|r16||Iron Composite|r32table>><br>When a wire or spool is fully wound, it will drop into coils of its corresponding material. A wire will create one coil, while a spool will create 10 coils and drop an empty spool to be reused. When a player winds a wire or spool, they will be awarded the advancement Wire Winder.

If there is a villager that hasn't chosen a job site and the winding jig hasn't been claimed by another villager, the villager has a chance to change their profession to chainmailler. If a villager with this profession has already been traded with, they cannot change jobs.

In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 winding jig can fuel for 40 seconds (4 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (64 winding jigs, 2560 seconds, 256 items).
