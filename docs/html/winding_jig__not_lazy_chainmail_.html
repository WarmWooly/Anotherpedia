[[Wires|Wires (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] and [[spools|spools (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] can be wound by right-clicking a winding jig with an industrial belt while holding the wire/spool. Different materials will take a varying amount of time to wind corresponding to their malleability (ex. gold is more malleable than iron). The following is a table of how malleable all the wires and spools are:<<table{{bMaterial}}|{{bWire}}|{{bSpool}}||Gold|{{r16}}|{{r160}}||Copper|{{r32}}|{{r320}}||Rose Gold|{{r48}}|{{r480}}||Iron|{{r64}}|{{r640}}||Netherite|{{r128}}|{{r1280}}||Iron Composite|{{r512}}|{{r5120}}table>>&spIndustrial belts will decrease the amount of winding needed to create coils. While winding a [[netherite wire|netherite wire (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] with a [[kelp industrial belt|kelp industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] will take 256 right clicks, the same wire with an [[iron composite chainmail industrial belt|iron composite chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] will only take 8 right clicks. Here are the speeds for all industrial belts:<<table{{bBelt|{{bSpeed}}||[[Kelp|Kelp Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r1}}||[[Leather|Leather Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r1}}||[[Copper|Copper Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r2}}||[[Iron|Iron Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r3}}||[[Gold|Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r4}}||[[Rose Gold|Rose Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r8}}||[[Netherite|Netherite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r16}}||[[Iron Composite|Iron Composite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]|{{r32}}table>>&spWhen a wire or spool is fully wound, it will drop into coils of its corresponding material. A wire will create one coil, while a spool will create 10 coils and drop an [[empty spool|empty spool (Not Lazy Chainmail)]] to be reused. When a player winds a wire or spool, they will be awarded the [[advancement|advancement (Minecraft)]] [[Wire Winder|Wire Winder (Not Lazy Chainmail)]].<<hr2Changing professionhr2>>If there is a [[villager|villager (Minecraft)]] that hasn't chosen a [[job site|job site (Minecraft)]] and the winding jig hasn't been claimed by another villager, the villager has a chance to change their profession to [[chainmailler|chainmailler (Not Lazy Chainmail)]]. If a villager with this profession has already been traded with, they cannot change jobs.<<hr2Fuelhr2>>In a [[furnace|furnace (Minecraft)]], [[blast furnace|blast furnace (Minecraft)]], or [[smoker|smoker (Minecraft)]], 1 winding jig can fuel for 40 [[seconds|second]] (4 items), with a maximum of 1 [[stack|stack (Minecraft)]] (64 winding jigs, 2560 seconds, 256 items).<<hrOld textureshr>>{{gal<<img(src=git/winding jig nlc.png(cap=The [[texture|texture (Minecraft)]] for a winding jig before [[1.2.0|Not Lazy Chainmail 1.2.0]].(galleryImgimg>>}}</div>
