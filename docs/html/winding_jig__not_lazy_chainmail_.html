      <h1>Winding Jig (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity (Minecraft)|Common||Stack size (Minecraft)|64||Tool to destroy|N/A (Axe (Minecraft) preferred)||blast resistance (Minecraft)|1||hardness (Minecraft)|2||Luminous (Minecraft)|No||Opacity (Minecraft)|Yes||Flammable (Minecraft)|No||Fire-resistant item (Minecraft)|Noinfo>>The winding jig is a block (Minecraft) in the Minecraft mod (Minecraft) Not Lazy Chainmail used to turn wires (Not Lazy Chainmail) and spools (Not Lazy Chainmail) into coils (Not Lazy Chainmail).



Winding jigs naturally generate in winding jig ruins (Not Lazy Chainmail) and in a chainmailler home (Not Lazy Chainmail).

The winding jig can be crafting (Minecraft) with 3 wooden slab (Minecraft), 4 stick (Minecraft), and 1 iron ingot (Minecraft) (fill the bottom row with slabs, the left and right columns with sticks, and the top slot with the iron).



Winding jigs require an industrial belts (Not Lazy Chainmail) to run, with better belts decreasing the time it takes to wind. Wires (Not Lazy Chainmail) and spools (Not Lazy Chainmail) can be wound by right-clicking a winding jig with an industrial belt while holding the wire/spool. Different materials will take a varying amount of time to wind corresponding to their malleability (ex. gold is more malleable than iron). The following is a table of how malleable all the wires and spools are:<<tableMaterial|Wire|Spool||Gold|r16|r160||Copper|r32|r320||Rose Gold|r48|r480||Iron|r64|r640||Netherite|r128|r1280||Iron Composite|r512|r5120table>><br>Industrial belts will decrease the amount of winding needed to create coils. While winding a netherite wire (Not Lazy Chainmail) with a kelp industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) will take 256 right clicks, the same wire with an iron composite chainmail industrial belt (Not Lazy Chainmail) will only take 8 right clicks. Here are the speeds for all industrial belts:<<tableBelt|{{bSpeed||Kelp Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Leather Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r1||Copper Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r2||Iron Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r3||Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r4||Rose Gold Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r8||Netherite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r16||Iron Composite Chainmail Industrial Belt (Not Lazy Chainmail)|r32table>><br>When a wire or spool is fully wound, it will drop into coils of its corresponding material. A wire will create one coil, while a spool will create 10 coils and drop an empty spool (Not Lazy Chainmail) to be reused. When a player winds a wire or spool, they will be awarded the advancement (Minecraft) Wire Winder (Not Lazy Chainmail).

If there is a villager (Minecraft) that hasn't chosen a job site (Minecraft) and the winding jig hasn't been claimed by another villager, the villager has a chance to change their profession to chainmailler (Not Lazy Chainmail). If a villager with this profession has already been traded with, they cannot change jobs.

In a furnace (Minecraft), blast furnace (Minecraft), or smoker (Minecraft), 1 winding jig can fuel for 40 second (4 items), with a maximum of 1 stack (Minecraft) (64 winding jigs, 2560 seconds, 256 items).
