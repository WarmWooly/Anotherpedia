They vary based on the version of the [[operating system]].<<hrWindows 7hr>><<img(src=git/windows 7 ethernet icon.png(cap=The icon for ethernet connection on Windows 7.(leftImgimg>>[[Windows 7]]'s ethernet icon was decently complex, having a full outline for the ethernet cable and moniter, including the illusion of [[depth]] by [[shading]].

It consists of a connected ethernet cable and moniter all using the same thick white lines beside the portion going [[horizontally|horizontal]] in the head of the ethernet cable, which is slightly thinner.<<hrWindows 11hr>><<img(src=git/windows 11 ethernet icon.png(cap=The icon for ethernet connection on Windows 11.img>>[[Windows 11]]'s ethernet icon is much rounder, where the moniter has two lines for the base instead of one, the ethernet cable only has a single line going through it, and the ethernet cable has a white outline, covering the moniter.</div>
