      <h1>Windows ethernet icon</h1>
      <div>On Windows, there is an icon that is displayed when there is a live ethernet connection to the device. They vary based on the version of the operating system.
Windows 7's ethernet icon was decently complex, having a full outline for the ethernet cable and moniter, including the illusion of depth by shading. The screen on the moniter has a slight tint, going from lighter to darker from the top left to the bottom right.
Windows 8's ethernet icon was more simplified compared to Windows 7, removing shading and unnecessary detail. The entire icon was comprised of straight lines, with the ethernet cable slightly covering the moniter.
Windows 10's ethernet icon is somewhat blocky and rather minimalistic. It consists of a connected ethernet cable and moniter all using the same thick white lines beside the portion going horizontally in the head of the ethernet cable, which is slightly thinner.
Windows 11's ethernet icon is much rounder, where the moniter has two lines for the base instead of one, the ethernet cable only has a single line going through it, and the ethernet cable has a white outline, covering the moniter.</div>
