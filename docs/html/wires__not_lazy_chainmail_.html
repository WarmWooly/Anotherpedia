      <h1>Wires (Not Lazy Chainmail)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|64||Fire/lava<br>resistance|Noinfo>>Wires are a type of item in the Minecraft mod Not Lazy Chainmail. Wires are used to be wound into coils and come in the materials of iron, gold, copper, netherite, rose gold, and iron composite. Spools can be used as a bulk alternative to wires.



All wires (besides netherite wire) can be crafted by placing 8 of their respective material nuggets into a circle. Iron wire requires iron nuggets, gold wire requires gold nuggets, copper wire requires copper nuggets, rose gold wire requires rose gold nuggets, and iron composite wire requires iron composite nuggets. For netherite wire, combine a gold wire with a netherite scrap.



Wires can be used on a winding jig or in an auto winder to be turned into coils. Different wires have different malleability and will take more/less time to wind up than others.<<tableMaterial|Wire||Gold|r16||Copper|r32||Rose Gold|r48||Iron|r64||Netherite|r128||Iron Composite|r512table>><br>Improved industrial belts can be used to decrease the time needed to wind a wire into a coil.</div>
