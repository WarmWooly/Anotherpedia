      <h1>Wisteria</h1>
      <div>Wisteria is a genus of a flowering legume that is known for its vibrant color and vine-like nature. It was classified in 1818 by Thomas Nuttall, which was specifically the American wisteria.&pWisteria grows by twisting its stem around tall structures, such as trees. It has leaves that grow along the vine, alongside flowers and pods, which contain Wisteria's seeds. The plant contains wisterin, a saponin of Wisteria, which is poisonous. The seeds are also highly poisonous on digestion. &pWisteria is found in many parts of the world, such as China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, northern Iran, eastern United States, and southern Canada.
There are currently four species of Wisteria that are accepted (in alphabetical order):&spWisteria brachybotrys&spWisteria floribunda&spWisteria frutescens&spWisteria sinensis</div>
