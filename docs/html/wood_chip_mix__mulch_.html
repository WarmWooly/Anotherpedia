Placing wood chip mix into a composter has a 100% chance of raising the compost level by 1. It takes 7 wood chip mixes to fill a composter, with every stack averaging 9.14 bonemeal composted.

Throwing wood chip mix into a wood chipper will turn it into wood pellets.

Using wood chip mix on a cauldron containing water will turn it into wood pulp. Sneaking while doing so will convert the entire held stack into wood pulp.</div>
