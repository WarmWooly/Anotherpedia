To craft a wood chipper, the recipe requires 4 iron ingots, 1 stonecutter, and 1 hopper (place the stonecutter in the middle, then the hopper in one of the bottom corners; fill the rest of the bottom two rows with iron).
For the specific items and chip counts while chipping, see wood chips ({{aiMulch).}}&spWood items thrown into the top of a wood chipper will be turned into wood chips. These wood chips will then be spit out in the direction the spout is facing on the wood chipper. There is no limit to how many items can be chipped at a time.&pWood chip mix is the only item that will not produce wood chips, making wood pellets instead.
