4 wood chips of the same type in a 2x2 square can be used to craft mulch of the same type. For example, 4 oak wood chips would make 1 oak mulch. 6 of any wood chips can also be crafted into wood chip mix (shapeless). 2 wood chips of the same time in a 2-wide horizontal line can be used to craft mulch slabs of the same type.

All wood chips, besides Crimson, Warped, and Hellfire, can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 0.75 items per item.

Placing wood chips into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. On average, it takes 8.06 wood chips to fill a composter, with every stack averaging 7.94 bonemeal composted.

All wood chips can be thrown into a mulch redefiner to be turned into all non-dyed wood chips.</div>
