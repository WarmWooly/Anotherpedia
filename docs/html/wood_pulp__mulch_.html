Wood pulp can be crafted from 1 wood chip mix and 1 water bucket (shapeless; an empty bucket will remain in the crafting grid).
Using wood chip mix on a cauldron containing water will turn it into wood pulp. Sneaking while doing so will convert the entire held stack into wood pulp.
Wood pulp can be crafted into 2 paper (shapeless).
Wood pulp can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 0.5 items per item.
Placing wood pulp into a composter has a 100% chance of raising the compost level by 1. It takes 7 wood pulp to fill a composter, with every stack averaging 9.14 bonemeal composted.
Throwing wood pulp into a wood chipper will turn it into 6 ambiguous wood chips.</div>
