Wooden pickaxes can collect most stone (Minecraft) block (Minecraft) and coal ore (Minecraft), with higher-tier ore (Minecraft) like iron ore (Minecraft) requiring a stone pickaxe (Minecraft).
The wooden pickaxe can be crafting (Minecraft) with 2 stick (Minecraft) and 3 planks (Minecraft) (fill the top row with planks, then the middle column with sticks). Crafting the wooden pickaxe will award the achievement (Minecraft) Time to Mine! (Minecraft) and counts towards MOAR Tools (Minecraft) on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
The chances to find a wooden pickaxe in chest (Minecraft) are the following (same for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition unless specified):&spThe bonus chest (Minecraft) has a 75% chance of containing 1 wooden pickaxe.
Wooden pickaxes can be used to mine stone blocks (i.e. cobblestone (Minecraft), coal ore (Minecraft)) faster than other tool (Minecraft). Each block broken will cost 1 durability (Minecraft). Blocks with a hardness (Minecraft) of 0 (instant-breaking with hand) will not take durability.
Wooden pickaxes are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. The wooden pickaxe deals 2 damage and has an attack cooldown of 1.2 (0.85 seconds or 17 tick (Minecraft)) on Minecraft: Java Edition and deals 3 damage on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
The wooden pickaxe can be repaired through combining (Minecraft) by crafting (Minecraft), using a grindstone (Minecraft), or using an anvil (Minecraft). Combining wooden pickaxes will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience (Minecraft) returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainsaws, costing experience. Wooden pickaxes can be repaired in an anvil using planks (Minecraft), restoring 25% of the wooden pickaxe's durability, rounded down.
Wooden pickaxes can be enchanting (Minecraft) with Unbreaking (Minecraft), Mending (Minecraft), Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft), Efficiency (Minecraft), Silk Touch (Minecraft)<<note(content=Silk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive.(text=noteCountnote>>, and Fortune (Minecraft) using an enchanted book (Minecraft) on an anvil (Minecraft). Unbreaking, Efficiency, Silk Touch, and Fortune may also be obtained in an enchanting table (Minecraft).
