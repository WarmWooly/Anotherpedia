      <h1>Wooden Pickaxe (Minecraft)</h1>
      <div><<info||Stats||Rarity|Common||Stack size|1||Durability|59s-uJE/60s-uBE||Enchantability|15||Harvest level|0||Efficiency|2||Attack damage|2s-uJE/3s-uBE||Attack speed|1.2||Fire/lava <br>esistance|Noinfo>>The wooden pickaxe is the weakest pickaxe in Minecraft and often one of the first tools used by the player in a world. Wooden pickaxes can collect most stone blocks and coal ore, with higher-tier ores like iron requiring a stone pickaxe.



The wooden pickaxe can be crafted with 2 sticks and 3 planks (fill the top row with planks, then the middle column with sticks). Crafting the wooden pickaxe will award the achievement Time to Mine! and counts towards MOAR Tools on Bedrock.

The chances to find a wooden pickaxe in chests are the following (same for Bedrock and Java unless specified):<br>The bonus chest has a 75% chance of containing 1 wooden pickaxe.



Wooden pickaxes can be used to mine stone blocks (i.e. cobblestone, coal ore) faster than other tools. Each block broken will cost 1 durability. Blocks with a hardness of 0 (instant-breaking with hand) will not take durability.

Wooden pickaxes are ideally not used in combat. Each attack will cost 2 durability. The wooden pickaxe deals 2 damage and has an attack cooldown of 1.2 (0.85 seconds or 17 ticks) on Java and deals 3 damage on Bedrock.

The wooden pickaxe can be repaired through combining by crafting, using a grindstone, or using an anvil. Combining wooden pickaxes will add the two durability values together with an additional 3 durability. Combining will remove all enchantments, with some experience returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainsaws, costing experience. Wooden pickaxes can be repaired in an anvil using planks, restoring 25% of the wooden pickaxe's durability, rounded down.

Wooden pickaxes can be enchanted with Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Vanishing, Efficiency, Silk Touch, and Fortune using an enchanted book on an anvil. Unbreaking, Efficiency, Silk Touch, and Fortune may also be obtained in an enchanting table.

In a furnace, blast furnace, or smoker, 1 wooden pickaxe can fuel for 8 seconds (1 item).</div>
