Crafting the wooden pickaxe will award the [[achievement|achievement (Minecraft)]] [[Time to Mine!|Time to Mine! (Minecraft)]] and counts towards [[MOAR Tools|MOAR Tools (Minecraft)]] on [[Bedrock|Minecraft: Bedrock Edition]].<<hr2Chest loothr2>>The chances to find a wooden pickaxe in [[chests|chest (Minecraft)]] are the following (same for [[Bedrock|Minecraft: Bedrock Edition]] and [[Java|Minecraft: Java Edition]] unless specified):&spThe [[bonus chest|bonus chest (Minecraft)]] has a 75% chance of containing 1 wooden pickaxe.<<hrUsagehr>><<hr2Mininghr2>>Wooden pickaxes can be used to mine stone blocks (i.e. [[cobblestone|cobblestone (Minecraft)]], [[coal ore|coal ore (Minecraft)]]) faster than other [[tools|tool (Minecraft)]].

Combining will remove all enchantments, with some [[experience|experience (Minecraft)]] returned when combining in a grindstone. Combining in an anvil will keep and combine the enchantments on the chainsaws, costing experience. Wooden pickaxes can be repaired in an anvil using [[planks|planks (Minecraft)]], restoring 25% of the wooden pickaxe's durability, rounded down.<<hr2Enchantinghr2>>Wooden pickaxes can be [[enchanted|enchanting (Minecraft)]] with [[Unbreaking|Unbreaking (Minecraft)]], [[Mending|Mending (Minecraft)]], [[Curse of Vanishing|Curse of Vanishing (Minecraft)]], [[Efficiency|Efficiency (Minecraft)]], [[Silk Touch|Silk Touch (Minecraft)]]<<note(content=Silk Touch and Fortune are mutually exclusive.(text=noteCountnote>>, and [[Fortune|Fortune (Minecraft)]] using an [[enchanted book|enchanted book (Minecraft)]] on an [[anvil|anvil (Minecraft)]].
