      <h1>wplace</h1>
      <div>wplace is a website created in July 2025 by Murilo Matsubara, inspired by the subreddit r/Place, where users can place pixels on an online map of the world in a collaborative effort to create artworks. The main limiting factor is a timer system that limits the number of pixels a user can place at a time, with the number of pixels increasing as the user contributes to wplace. wplace uses MapLibre and OpenFreeMap to run its mapping, while map data is from OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap. wplace has a premium currency called Droplets, which can be obtained by placing pixels, leveling up, or paying real money.<br><br>wplace's popularity stems from the collaborative nature of the project, the ability for anyone to contribute, and the groundwork already laid by other artists. Most art is centered around large population centers, such as capitals, cities, landmarks, and other places of interest. Places with names reminiscent to characters tend to get artwork of that character, such as Link Island getting covered in Link. More popular media tends to get more artwork based artworks based around them, including Undertale/Deltarune, Pokémon, Mario, and Kirby.</div>
