      <h1>Yagami backwards</h1>
      <div>When reversing the letters in the Japanese surname "Yagami", it spells "Imagay", which can be expanded out to "I'm a gay". In the popular manga and anime Death Note, the protagonist is Light Yagami, which brought the surname into an English-speaking culture where this conversion could be made. This follows a similar format to ICUP, where a person is told to do something to a base phrase. Instead of asking a person to spell "ICUP" (which sounds like "I see you pee" when spelled out), they are asked to say "Yagami" backward. The payoff comes in the form of mild humiliation when the person proclaims that "I'm a gay".</div>
