      <div><<shortWordplay from reversing "Yagami"short>><<img(src=git/yagami backwards.png(cap=A [[meme|internet meme]] of [[L|L (Death Note)]] telling Light that "Yagami" backwards is "I'm a gay".<<ref(content=link|https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathNoteMemes/comments/tcvww6/i_legit_found_this_in_a_shein_review_lmao/(text=refCountref>>img>>When reversing the [[letters|letter (linguistics)]] in the Japanese [[surname]] "[[Yagami]]", it spells "Imagay", which can be expanded out to "I'm a [[gay]]". In the popular [[manga]] and [[anime]] {{i[[Death Note]]}}, the [[protagonist]] is [[Light Yagami]], which brought the surname into an [[English]]-speaking culture where this conversion could be made. This follows a similar format to [[ICUP|ICUP (wordplay)]], where a person is told to do something to a base phrase. Instead of asking a person to spell "ICUP" (which sounds like "I see you pee" when spelled out), they are asked to say "Yagami" backward. The payoff comes in the form of mild [[humiliation]] when the person proclaims that "I'm a gay".</div>
