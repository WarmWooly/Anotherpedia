      <div>{{iYou are dead}} is an email sent by cody rudland to Jeffery Epstein's Yahoo! Mail on August 13, 2019, 6:48 AM. The email was Epstein file releases alongside the Epstein files. It was sent three days after death of Jeffrey Epstein, and reads, "Lol good riddance". The email address behind cody rudland is redactions in the Epstein files, and there hasn't been a credible source on who it could be. It is mainly notable for being at the top of Jmail and the humor message sent by rudland to Epstein post-mortem.</div>
