      <h1>Your Only Move Is HUSTLE</h1>
      <div>{{iYour Only Move Is HUSTLE}}, also known as {{iYOMI HUSTLE}} or {{iYOMIH}}, is an online 2d fighting game developed by IvySly, releasing the Open Beta Version on itch.io on November 11, 2022,<<ref(content=link|https://ivysly.itch.io/your-only-move-is-hustle(text=refCountref>> and then onto Steam on February 2, 2023.<<ref(content=link|https://store.steampowered.com/app/2212330/Your_Only_Move_Is_HUSTLE/(text=refCountref>> Unlike other games in the genre, YOMIH uses a turn system with buttons, sliders, and graphs to determine attacks and movement. Different actions will take differing amount of frames, allowing players to fall out of sync and perform moves while their opponent is mid-action, as well as a prediction system to see what possible actions the opponent may respond with. The gameplay is inspired by the physics-based turn-based battler Toribash and the Super Smash Bros. series, notably the fan-made Turbo Mode.&pThe game takes on a pixel art aesthetic with simple stick figure characters reminiscent of stickman fighting animations. <<AsofApril 2025>>, there are 5 playable characters: Ninja, Cowboy, Wizard, Robot, and Mutant. There are also many fan-made characters in the form of modding that can be fought, infinitely expanding the small roster. All the characters have unique mechanics, move sets, and strategies associated with them. Characters can also be customized to allow for player self-expression.
The game has two characters placed into a rectangular box, both being able to make their first move. All actions are dictated through various buttons. Actions may have sliders, toggles, or graphs to dictate various factors of the move, such as speed, direction, and other effects. Some factors, such as directional influence or the Wizard's Orb, can be changed irrespective of the current move.&pThere are 5 categories of actions: Movement, Attack, Special, Super, and Defense. Movement is used to move around the box and reposition the character. Attacks are often simple moves to deal damage to the opponent, which are especially useful when comboing. Specials are unique moves that define the character, such as the Cowboy's various tools and teleportation moves and the Robot's transformations. Supers are more powerful than other attacking moves, but cost levels from the Super Meter to use. Bursting is also a Super, despite using the Burst Meter. Defense contains Blocking and Dodging to defend against attacks. Hustling is also a Defense move, gaining a level to the Super Meter when pulled off.&pThe prediction system shows what will happen based on the given moves, allowing the player to check what options the opponent has alongside their own. This system gives players the opportunity to outwit their opponent or juke their attacks based on what they believe the opponent would do in that situation. It also allows players to determine where an opponent will be mid-combo to prevent launching them away early.</div>
