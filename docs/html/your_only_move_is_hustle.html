      <h1>Your Only Move Is HUSTLE</h1>
      <div>{{iYour Only Move Is HUSTLE}}, also known as {{iYOMI HUSTLE}} or {{iYOMIH}}, is an online multiplayer 2D video game fighting game developed by IvySly, releasing the YOMIH (Open Beta Version) on itch.io on November 11, 2022, and then onto Steam (service) on February 2, 2023. Unlike other games in the video game genres, YOMIH uses a turn-based mechanic with buttons, sliders, and graphs to determine attacks and movement. Different actions will take differing amount of frame (YOMIH), allowing players to fall out of sync and perform moves while their opponent is mid-action, as well as a prediction system (YOMIH) to see what possible actions the opponent may respond with. The gameplay is inspired by the physics game turn-based battler Toribash and the Super Smash Bros. series, notably the fan-made Super Smash Bros. Turbo Mode.<br><br>The game takes on a pixel art aesthetic with simple stick figure characters reminiscent of stickman fighting animations. <<AsofApril 2025>>, there are 5 playable YOMIH characters: Ninja (YOMIH), Cowboy (YOMIH), Wizard (YOMIH), Robot (YOMIH), and Mutant (YOMIH). There are also many fan-made characters in the form of YOMIH modding that can be fought, infinitely expanding the small roster. All the characters have unique mechanics, move sets, and strategies associated with them. Characters can also be character customization (YOMIH) to allow for player self-expression.

The game has two characters placed into a rectangular box, both being able to make their first move. All actions are dictated through various buttons. Actions may have sliders, toggles, or graphs to dictate various factors of the move, such as speed, direction, and other effects. Some factors, such as directional influence (YOMIH) or the Wizard's Orb (YOMIH), can be changed irrespective of the current move.<br><br>There are 5 categories of actions: Movement (YOMIH), Attack (YOMIH), Special (YOMIH), Super (YOMIH), and Defense (YOMIH). Movement is used to move around the box and reposition the character. Attacks are often simple moves to deal damage to the opponent, which are especially useful when Combo (YOMIH). Specials are unique moves that define the character, such as the Cowboy's various tools and teleportation moves and the Robot's transformations. Supers are more powerful than other attacking moves, but cost levels from the Super Meter (YOMIH) to use. Burst (YOMIH) is also a Super, despite using the Burst Meter. Defense contains Block (YOMIH) and Dodging (YOMIH) to defend against attacks. Hustle (YOMIH) is also a Defense move, gaining a level to the Super Meter when pulled off.<br><br>The prediction system (YOMIH) shows what will happen based on the given moves, allowing the player to check what options the opponent has alongside their own. This system gives players the opportunity to outwit their opponent or juke their attacks based on what they believe the opponent would do in that situation. It also allows players to determine where an opponent will be mid-combo to prevent launching them away early.</div>
