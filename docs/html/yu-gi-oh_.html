  <h1>{{iYu-Gi-Oh!}}</h1>
  <div><<shortManga, card game, and anime franchiseshort>><<img(src=git/yugioh.jpg(cap=One of the numerous logos for the {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} series.img>>{{b{{iYu-Gi-Oh!}}}} is a [[franchise]] made by [[Kazuki Takahashi]] in 1996. The original [[Japanese]] name for {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}}, {{i遊☆戯☆王}}, is translated to [[English]] as "King of Games". {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} started off as a [[manga]] series. Before the [[card game]], most people knew {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} for the manga where [[Yugi Mutou|Yugi Mutou (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] and other cast members played all sorts of games. Eventually, Kazuki Takahashi made what would later become the card game. It was originally known in-series as {{iMagic & Wizards}}, and later on became known as {{iDuel Monsters}}. The readers of the series loved the card game so much to the point where Kazuki Takahashi made it the main focus of the story and it eventually became the card game of the series.<<hrCard Gamehr>>The real-world card game of {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} is separated into two different versions. These versions are called the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Original Card Game}}, and the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game}}. The {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Original Card Game}} is commonly [[abbreviated|abbreviation]] as "OCG", and similarly the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game}} is abbreviated as "TCG".<<hr2OCGhr2>>The OCG is the version of the game played primarily in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Thailand]]. The OCG has an entirely separate [[banlist|Banlist (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] from the TCG. Cards from the TCG are not legal for use in the OCG due to a difference in the card backs.&sp<<hr2 TCG hr2>>The TCG is the version of the game played primarily worldwide, but mainly in [[America]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], and [[Australia]]. The TCG cards are produced by the [[Belgian|Belgium]] [[company]] of [[Cartamundi]]. The English cards, however, are printed in their production facility in America, whereas all non-English cards they manufacture are done so in their Belgium facility.<<hrAnimehr>><<hr2Toei Animationhr2>>[[Toei Animation]] made an adaptation of the original {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} manga before {{iDuel Monsters}} became the main focus. While Duel Monsters was in the series at the time, it was not the main focus. The Toei Animation is commonly called "Season 0" by some fans, but it should be specified that it is a separate series and not a season of {{iYu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters}}. The Toei anime was never released in English.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}}hr2>>{{tFor {{aiYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}} characters, see [[{{aiYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}} characters]].}}&sp{{iYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}} is the "first season" of the {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} anime series. It began its run in Japan on the 18th of April 2000 and ended on the 10th of June 2006. {{iDuel Monsters}} has a total of 224 episodes. It was produced by [[Studio Gallop]] and [[Nihon Ad Systems]]. In America, it was handled by [[4Kids Entertainment]]. {{iDuel Monsters}} was about Yugi Mutou and friends as they played the game of {{iDuel Monsters}} over ancient Egyptian artifacts with supernatural powers, and later in the series, the 3 Egyptian God Cards.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh! GX}}hr2>>{{tFor {{aiYu-Gi-Oh! GX}} characters, see [[{{aiYu-Gi-Oh! GX}} characters]].}}&sp{{iYu-Gi-Oh! GX}} is the successor to the previous {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}}.

Later on in the series Yusei and others must go up against the Dark Signers who are the dead returned to life by the [[Earthbound Gods|Earthbound Immortal (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] as they try to open a portal to the Netherworld in the most dangerous part of where all the roughest part of where all the poor people live. Much later in the series, the main cast must go up against time travelers trying to prevent the mass genocide of humanity by robots after the endless power supply that powers all of [[New Domino City|New Domino City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] gets overloaded causing all of humanity to be doomed and countless lives to be cost in the original timeline's future. In the new timeline, those time travelers intentionally destroyed that generator, which was a less advanced version of the one they had in the future, with an overload 17 years prior to the start of {{i5D's}} causing a lot of lives to be lost, many lives ruined, families to be torn apart, the Earthbound Gods being unsealed and awakened, and a catastrophic tectonic shift that split [[Domino City|Domino City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] in two. {{i5D's}} had a total of 154 episodes, but only 123 of them were ever dubbed into English.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh!
