  <h1>Yu-Gi-Oh!</h1>
  <div>{{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} is a franchise made by Kazuki Takahashi in 1996. The original Japanese name for Yu-Gi-Oh!, 遊☆戯☆王, is translated to English as "King of Games". Yu-Gi-Oh! started off as a manga series. Before the card game, most people knew Yu-Gi-Oh! for the manga where Yugi Mutou (Yu-Gi-Oh!) and other cast members played all sorts of games. Eventually, Kazuki Takahashi made what would later become the card game. It was originally known in-series as Magic & Wizards, and later on became known as Duel Monsters. The readers of the series loved the card game so much to the point where Kazuki Takahashi made it the main focus of the story and it eventually became the card game of the series.
The real-world card game of Yu-Gi-Oh! is separated into two different versions. These versions are called the Yu-Gi-Oh! Original Card Game, and the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. The Yu-Gi-Oh! Original Card Game is commonly abbreviation as "OCG", and similarly the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game is abbreviated as "TCG".
The OCG is the version of the game played primarily in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The OCG has an entirely separate Banlist (Yu-Gi-Oh!) from the TCG. Cards from the TCG are not legal for use in the OCG due to a difference in the card backs.&sp
The TCG is the version of the game played primarily worldwide, but mainly in America, Europe, Latin America, and Australia. The TCG cards are produced by the Belgium company of Cartamundi. The English cards, however, are printed in their production facility in America, whereas all non-English cards they manufacture are done so in their Belgium facility.
Toei Animation made an adaptation of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! manga before Duel Monsters became the main focus. While Duel Monsters was in the series at the time, it was not the main focus. The Toei Animation is commonly called "Season 0" by some fans, but it should be specified that it is a separate series and not a season of Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters. The Toei anime was never released in English.
