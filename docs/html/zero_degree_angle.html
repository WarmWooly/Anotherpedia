Zero degree angles share all the same [[points|point (geometry)]] because they overlap each other. Zero degree angles may be mistaken as a single [[ray|ray (geometry)]] as they share the same angle. They are often shown at different lengths so both rays are visible (such as O-->A-->B) to avoid this.</div>
