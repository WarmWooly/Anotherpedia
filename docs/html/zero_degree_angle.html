  <h1>Zero degree angle</h1>
  <div>A {{bzero degree angle}}, also known as a {{bzero angle}}, as implied in its name, is an angle of 0 degree (angle), or 0 radian. Zero degree angles share all the same point (geometry) because they overlap each other. Zero degree angles may be mistaken as a single ray (geometry) as they share the same angle. They are often shown at different lengths so both rays are visible (such as O-->A-->B) to avoid this.</div>
