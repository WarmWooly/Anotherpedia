      <h1>Zero degree angle</h1>
      <div>A zero degree angle, also known as a zero angle, as implied in its name, is an angle of 0 degrees, or 0 radians. Zero degree angles share all the same points because they overlap each other. Zero degree angles may be mistaken as a single ray as they share the same angle. They are often shown at different lengths so both rays are visible (such as O-->A-->B) to avoid this.</div>
