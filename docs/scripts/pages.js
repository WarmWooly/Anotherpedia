    content: `This [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] is used to show the {{bbest practices}} when [[making/editing|how to make/edit pages]] pages on [[Anotherpedia]]. It will be broken up into three sections: {{brequirements}}, {{blimited exeptions}}, and {{bpreferred}}.<<hrRequirementshr>>These are practices that are expected to be in every page!<<hr2Short texthr2>>Short text, as denoted with <<nostyle<<short short>>nostyle>>, is used to give a concise summary of a page. This is required for every page to have. The following are examples of good short texts: ;;[[Abbreviation]] - {{iShortening of a word or phrase}}|[[Neptune]] - {{i8th planet in the Solar System}}|[[Lanturn]] - {{i171st Water and Electric type Pokémon;;These summaries accurately convey to readers what a page is about and may even contain information a reader was looking for. Here are some examples of what not to do:;;Abbreviation - {{iTo compress a word or into a shorter form}} (this is technically the same, but it could be more concise)|Neptune - {{i8th planet from the Sun in the Solar System between Uranus and Pluto}} (this contains too much information, and in this case, it may be factually incorrect as Neptune and Pluto trade places in distance from the Sun due to Pluto's orbit)|Lanturn - {{iAn anglerfish-like magical creature}} (this contains little valuable information and would leave readers confused);;<<hr2Imageshr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia best practices.png(cap=This is the caption.img>>Images are always required on pages. Even if the image is only tangentially related, it should be used when possible. Avoid blurry/low-quality images when possible. Captions should be concise, but every image must have a caption. Formatting images using (brightImg, (darkImg, (bigImg, and (leftImg should be used when needed. Avoid re-using images from other pages where possible.<<hr2Grammarhr2>>Grammar is important, even here! People will always make mistakes, so it is good to check over work to verify that it is grammatically correct. Small errors may appear, but that's just part of the process! May it be an extra space, two "and"s used in a list, or an exclamation point instead of a period, it's not the end of the world. Here are three examples of great, mediocre, and poor grammar:<<quoThere is no scientific consensus on what was before the Big Bang.&pThere is no consensus from scientists on what was before the Big Bang .&pthere isn;t a consensus from science on before the big bangquo>>Pages submitted with abhorrent grammar will be rejected, but small errors are allowed and will be fixed.<<hrLimited exceptionshr>>There may be a few exceptions to these practices as needed.<<hr2Good titleshr2>>Pages aren't news articles or sensational media, but pools of information. When possible, use the least words that accurately describe what you are talking about, such as [[water]] and [[book]]. Pages on media, such as books and movies, should use italics (<<nostyle{{i }}nostyle>>). For example, the book {{i[[Put a Cherry on Top: Generosity in Life & Leadership]]}}. When multiple topics share the same name, use parentheses to differentiate between them, such as the word [[taboo]] and the board game [[{{iTaboo}} (game)]].<<hr2Bold opening wordhr2>>In the opening of most pages, the page's title is inside the opening sentence. When it is, it should be bolded using <<nostyle{{b }}nostyle>>. Here are some examples:;;[[Abbreviation]] - An {{babbreviation}} is any shortening of a term to condense the content.|[[Neptune]] - {{bNeptune}} is the 8th [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]].|[[Lanturn]] - {{bLanturn}} is an [[anglerfish]]-like [[Water|Water Type (Pokémon)]] and [[Electric type|Electric type (Pokémon)]] [[Pokémon|Pokémon (fictional species)]] from the [[second generation|Generation II (Pokémon)]].;;Now these opening sentences all include the topic and are thusly bolded. Here are a few cases where it would be best to not include the full topic, where it isn't bolded:;;[[List of pages related to Anotherpedia]] - This is a list of all [[pages|page (Anotherpedia)]] which relate to [[Anotherpedia]] in [[alphabetical order]].|[[How to use Anotherpedia]] - [[Anotherpedia]] is designed closely to [[Wikipedia]], following many similar principles for navigation and use.|[[Pageman]] - This page is a custom minigame of [[hangman]] using the names of pages.;;<<hr2Don't link everythinghr2>>[[Links|link (Anotherpedia)]] are used for navigation on Anotherpedia. They are especially useful for allowing readers to understand difficult terms or find out related information on a topic. [[However]], [[not]] [[everything]] [[needs|need]] [[a|a (word)]] [[link|hyperlink]]. If links are overused, they tend to just clutter the page. Use links when it is necessary or if you find it to be a good fit. Not every link will be perfect, and there may be words or topics that would be better suited to be turned into a link. That's why the iterative process on Anotherpedia will only allow pages to get better over time. Avoid splitting complex topics up, such as [[time paradox]] into [[time]] [[paradox]]. Also avoid any unneeded use, even if there is a page connected to it, such as "there were [[2]] [[apples|apple]] at the store" (2 should not be linked).<<hr2Italics are {{iimportanthr2>>Italics, added with <<nostyle{{i }}nostyle>>, should be used when writing down proper titles. This includes the titles of {{ibooks}}, {{imovies}}, {{isong albums}}, {{igames}} and other relevant content. Unironically, the [[{{iU.S. Government Publishing Office Style Manual}} (Chapter 11)]] is a great source of information when confused about italics. Feel free to also look it up and see if that use case would require italics or not. Italics should be used for {{iemphasis}} sparingly, but it can help stick words out better than {{bbolding}} them.<<hr2Header orderhr2>>Headers are extremely useful for breaking up information into more manageable chunks, as seen here. However, the largest header <<nostyle<<hr hr>>nostyle>> should be used, then hr2 and hr3. Headers should be as short as possible and relevant to the page.<<hrPreferredhr>>These practices are not required, but they should be used when needed.<<hr2Use of &ampp and &ampsphr2>><<nostyle&p and &spnostyle>> are some of the most useful tools for an editor. <<nostyle&pnostyle>> should be used for full breaks between topics, while <<nostyle&spnostyle>> is better off for formatting. Avoid using multiple "<<nostyle&pnostyle>>"s and "<<nostyle&spnostyle>>"s to make larger breaks. Also avoid using <<nostyle&pnostyle>> and <<nostyle&spnostyle>> at the end of sections before headers, as headers are automatically spaced away from the text.<<hr2Use other pages as referencehr2>>Making a page similar to another prior topic? Feel free to reference similar pages for formatting and styling to help keep your page consistent with other pages. The pages for {{i[[Minecraft]]}} [[items|item (Minecraft)]], for example ([[coal|coal (Minecraft)]] and [[flint|flint (Minecraft)]]), share similar sections containing information.<<hr2Disambiguationhr2>>Sometimes there are a lot of different topics with the same or similar names. Making a disambiguation page can help make it easier to go to the page a reader is looking for. It is best used when three or more terms are similar, such as [[cannonball (disambiguation)]] and [[goo (disambiguation)]].<<shortBest practices when writing on Anotherpediashort>>`,

    content: `<<shortUpdate log for Anotherpediashort>>This is the {{bAnotherpedia log}}, acting as a crude [[update log]] for [[Anotherpedia]], with the most recent changes being shown at the top. This was made on February 18th, 2024, so any substantial changes made to Anotherpedia prior will not be listed.<<hrMay 31st 2025hr>><<hr2Move to GitHub Pageshr2>>Anotherpedia used to be hosted on the open [[IDE]] and [[website host]] [[Glitch|Glitch (IDE)]]. As they are [[shutting down|Shutdown of Glitch]] on June 8, 2025, I needed to move Anotherpedia over to a new host. As I was already using [[GitHub Pages]] to serve images, I decided it would be easiest to move the entire site over. The main downside is the loss of [[Anotherpedia.txt]], as only [[static sites|static website]] can be hosted over GitHub Pages. This means that there is currently no built-in way to send new pages/page edits to the Anotherpedia Discord without directly copying the code and manually sending it.<<hr2Anotherpedia.comhr2>>I've been sitting on the anotherpedia.cpm [[domain|website domain]] since March 2025 from [[Namecheap]] after failing to find an affordable host for the [[SSL certificate]] needed for the site to be hosted as [[HTTPS]]. However, GitHub Pages offers this service for free with [[Let's Encrypt]], allowing anotherpedia.com to be used for the site. The direct GitHub page, warmwooly.github.io/Anotherpedia/, can also be used, but is to be avoided when possible. Hopefully, over the coming days, the new link will become available over [[Google Search]] and possibly [[Bing Search]] in time for anotherpedia.glitch.me's shutdown.<<hrMay 12th 2025hr>><<hr2Top taghr2>>There is now a <<nostyle<<top>>nostyle>> tag used to get the top image from a page, filling a similar purpose to the <<nostyle<<disam>>nostyle>> tag, just without grabbing every image in the page.<<hr2Search using page contenthr2>>In the [[settings]], users can now choose to additionally search pages based on the content within each page. This will have the lowest priority in the search list and will be disabled by default due to the tendency for the search relevancy to be less consistent than using the page names and short text.<<hr2Images in searchhr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia images in search.png(cap=Images appearing alongside the search 'stake'.img>>In the settings, users can now have the top image appear alongside the reset of the search information (kinda like Wikipedia). This new feature will be enabled by default.<<hrJanuary 15th 2025hr>><<hr2As of taghr2>>There is now a <<nostyle<<asof>>nostyle>> tag used to keep track of information that may change over time, which can be viewed on [[as ofs in Anotherpedia pages]].<<hrNovember 21st 2024hr>><<hr2Keybindshr2>>There are now keybinds that can be used for editing Anotherpedia! This update is intended to greatly reduce the struggle of editing due to the smooth integration of keybinds such as {{iCtrl + I}}, {{codeCtrl + K}}, and <<tableAlt + T (this is a table)table>>&spIt also includes pre-fabs of tags for img, vid, yt, note, and ref to also reduce the time spent writing and remembering syntax!<<hr2Mobile navigation improvementshr2>>Improvements to how the search bar and other button options will now allow for a seamless transition between a horizontal and vertical view when using Anotherpedia.<<hrSeptember 20th 2024hr>><<hr2Achievementshr2>>There are now achievements on Anotherpedia under [[Anotherpedia achievements]], collected by exploring pages, playing minigames, and just interacting with the site! All achievements are saved locally.<<hrAugust 22nd 2024hr>><<hr2Audiohr2>>Sound files are now fully supported on Anotherpedia! Using <<nostyle<<aud and aud>>nostyle>> will allow users to input .mp3 files, .ogg files, and .wav files, without any (src= or (cap=.<<hrJuly 29th 2024hr>><<hr2Sending Editshr2>>Created and edited pages can now directly be sent to the Anotherpedia <<link(src=https://discord.com/invite/JHHMAEpEej(text=Discordlink>>. This will greatly expand the capabilities of the site, allowing any user to send in their edits and new page ideas without the hassle of joining Discord and sending the link themselves. This will hopefully allow for an increase in the widespread use of this silly website.<<hrJune 18th 2024hr>><<hr2Git repositoryhr2>>There is now a dedicated [[Git repository]] for Anotherpedia, that can be found at <<link(src=https://github.com/WarmWooly/Anotherpedia/(text=github.com/WarmWooly/Anotherpedialink>>. Currently, it's only used as a {{imuch}} better storage solution for hosting images. Instead of {{codeimages/}} and {{codevideos/}}, {{codegit/}} will be used to refer to images hosted on GitHub. {{codeimages/}} and other redirects will still be supported, but new images will solely be added under {{codegit/}}. As over 1,200 images had to be transferred, there is a real chance some images may be broken/missing, and it will be high-priority to make sure that all images are correctly added and usable as if the change never occurred.<<hr2Minecraft Wiki redirectshr2>>When going to pages that haven't been made ending in (Minecraft), the following will appear:<<quoIt seems this [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] hasn't been made yet! Feel free to [[make it|how to make/edit pages]] or check to see if there is a corresponding article on the [[Minecraft Wiki]] (<<link(src=https://minecraft.wiki/w/cobblestone(text=minecraft.wiki/w/cobblestonelink>>).quo>>This feature, like the prior redirects to Wikipedia, are just made to allow users to learn more about topics they are interested in, and this feature may be extended to other wikis in the future.<<hr2Scrollable tableshr2>>On mobile, tables used to jut outside the screen, allowing for the entire page to be scaled and horizontally scrolled. Tables will now create a horizontal scroll bar when their size extends out from the screen on mobile devices, fixing this issue.<<hr2Inline codehr2>>Code text can now be used like other formatting, such as {{codehere}} and {{codeover here}} using <<nostyle{{code}}nostyle>>. This will make it easier to incorporate programming concepts, variables, and other technical information in a format that contrasts against the standard text on Anotherpedia.<<hrMay 16th 2024hr>><<hr2Wikipedia redirectshr2>>When there are red links to pages that do not exist, the following will appear:<<quoIt seems this [[page|page (Anotherpedia)]] hasn't been made yet! Feel free to [[make it|how to make/edit pages]] or check to see if there is a corresponding article on [[Wikipedia]] (<<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example(text=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/examplelink>>).quo>>This feature is not made to supplement Anotherpedia for Wikipedia, but rather a crude method to allow users to learn more about a subject when a page has not been made yet. It is still a priority to create pages on [[everything]], even if Wikipedia or other [[online encylopedias|online encyclopedia]] cover it.<<hr2Sidebar sizehr2>>In the [[settings]], the size of the sidebar can now be changed. This is mainly used to give more space to the section titles, as they can easily be cramped by the current size. The original 10% will remain the default size unless changed in the future.<<hrMay 12th 2024hr>><<hr2Videoshr2>>Videos are now fully supported on Anotherpedia! Using <<nostyle<<vid and vid>>nostyle>> will allow users to input .mp4 files, .avi files, .mov files, and other videos, sharing the same styling as images (such as (src= and (cap=).<<hrMay 2nd 2024hr>><<hr2Referenceshr2>>References have now been added, allowing sources to be cited for texts when need be. References still won't be required in any capacity, but are moreso a nice-to-have. They work the same as notes, having a tooltip an a separate section automatically generated at the bottom.<<hr2Automatic notes and referenceshr2>>Notes used to be manually set, where the user would have to put in <<nostyle{{n[1]}}, {{n[2]}}, {{n[3]}}, and so onnostyle>> to label notes. This is no longer the case! Replacing the (text= field with noteCount or refCount for notes and references respectively will automatically count and set the appearance to be accurate.<<hrApril 29th 2024hr>><<hr2Anotherpedia disclaimerhr2>>{{tMain article: [[Anotherpedia disclaimer]]}}&spThe Anotherpedia disclaimer has been made, fully covering how Anotherpedia is imperfect, imprecise, and not made for medical, legal, or informative use. It can be seen at the bottom of every page, allowing users to easily access this disclaimer. There are also new tags, reflected in [[How to make/edit pages]], on addable disclaimers to pages. These addable disclaimers are {{bNOT}} required, but are generally a good addition to improve the user experience. There are currently three disclaimers (more may be added in the future; this will not be updated):<<quo<<nolegal>><<nomedical>><<nodanger>>quo>><<hrApril 24th 2024hr>><<hr2Anti-italic texthr2>>A new text styling, anti-italic text, has been added to reverse italic text. This is reflected in [[How to make/edit pages]], using the code <<nostyle{{ai }}nostyle>>. The main purpose is to allow for grammatically correct italicizing when all the text is already italics. See the following example:<<quo{{iThis section contains [[spoilers|spoiler]] for the show {{ai[[The Simpsons]]}}.}}quo>><<hr2Search optimizationhr2>>Searching now is practically instant, causing no lag! I'm surprised I didn't think of stopping the search as soon as it had enough pages to fill the search list. Instead of iterating over all the 900+ pages as of writing this four separate times and checking them, it will now stop searching when it no longer needs to find more pages. This especially helps when starting a search, no longer checking over hundreds of pages that start with or include 'a' or 's.' Overall, it will aid in making the user experience when navigating Anotherpedia greatly!<<hrMarch 15th 2024hr>><<hr2Sections in sidebarhr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia sections cropped.png(cap=The sidebar for [[{{iThe Simpsons}} (season 7)]] (cropped for space).img>>Section links will now be automatically generated when loading a page, allowing for easier navigation through larger pages (including this one). It currently does not update with the page as it is being edited because it is very expensive to run the check every page update. I do plan in the future to bring this feature to mobile users and to make it work while editing the page. For now, it is a great start in increasing the navigational ability of Anotherpedia.<<hrMarch 2nd 2024hr>><<hr2Anotherpedia.txt compatabiltyhr2>>Anotherpedia now has a built-in system for [[Anotherpedia.txt]], allowing users to quickly turn their page's code into a sharable link! This will greatly decrease the time from copying the information of a page and sending it, helping decrease the burden of text limits and short expirations with most [[text-sharing sites|text-sharing website]].<<hrFebruary 24th 2024hr>><<hr2Author colorshr2>>Authors will now have differing [[colors|color]] based on the number of pages they have edited or helped on. This looks cool and gives a quick way to show how prominent you are in Anotherpedia. This can be disabled in the settings under {{bauthor colors}}.<<hr2Discord serverhr2>>Anotherpedia now has a [[Discord|Discord (application)]] server! The primary use is to share pages and edits, alongside [[memes|internet meme]], [[bugs|bug (computer programming)]], and other [[ideas|idea]] with other people. Go to <<link(src=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEej(text=https://discord.gg/JHHMAEpEejlink>> to join!<<hrFebruary 23rd 2024hr>><<hr2Preview external linkshr2>>External links can now show a small preview of the website being visited, which can be enabled in the [[settings]]. Because many websites prohibit cross-origin view via [[iframes|iframe]], {{bexternal link preview}} is disabled by default. <<nostyle<<web>>nostyle>> tags will now also display a message when trying to load [[HTTP]] sites:<<quoSorry, {{bhttp://www.websitename.com}} couldn't be loaded because it is served over HTTP and not HTTPS.quo>><<hr2Notes areahr2>><<safe<<img(src=git/noteArea.png(cap=The note area for the page [[Ayds]].(bigImgimg>>safe>>Notes will now generate an area at the bottom of the page, allowing notes to contain usable links. It will also give a method for users to view notes when tooltips are disabled. The notes area is enabled by default. You can also click on notes to go to the note mentioned. The notes area can be disabled in the settings.<<hrFebruary 18th 2024hr>><<hr2Google Search availabilityhr2>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia google old.png(cap=The result for searching {{ianotherpedia}} on Google Search on Feb 18, 2024.(bigImgimg>><<img(src=git/anotherpedia google.png(cap=The result for searching {{ianotherpedia}} on Google Search on Mar 14, 2024.(bigImgimg>>Anotherpedia can now be found on [[Google Search]]!

There won't be any announcement for it, but it would be nice to have.<<hr2Multiple author credithr2>>When writing or editing pages, the old system only allowed credit to a single author. This is no more, with a new and simple system to allow multiple authors to get credit! To credit multiple authors, all you need to do is add a comma between authors, such as:<<quoEditKing,WikipediaIsBetterquo>>There is no limit to the number of authors and the footer will create multiple links for the different authors. The main use is for when two authors work together or if an author makes a substantial edit to a page in which credit would be due.<<hr2Italic titleshr2>>Want to properly format [[games|video game]], [[species]], and [[shows|TV show]]? Well, now you can in the title! Just like {{iitalics}} normally, you can now put italics into titles. All relevant pages have undergone italicizing, now with grammatically correct titling!`,

The balls and other obstacles are often put as separate layers with different "difficulties" attributed to them, naturally getting harder as the player progresses.&p[[Segway Guy|Segway Guy (Happy Wheels)]] is the most used [[character|characters (Happy Wheel)]] used for Ball Falls, with most forcing Segway Guy off his segway to allow him to squeeze between obstacles. Rapidly pressing movement buttons can be used to shimmy through tighter gaps, but there are some cases where the character becomes stuck, requiring the player to restart the level. Grabbing onto balls can aid in orienting the character through obstacles. Triangle spikes, the most used lethal obstacle, can easily take off limbs, behead, or even explode the character, increasing the precision required to get to the bottom.`,

Benson's face, grumpy, is contained within a black square to the left of the banner.

Garfield]]. After Garfield's [[assassination|Assassination of James A. Garfield]] on September 19, 1881, Arthur served until the end of the [[term|presidential term (United States)]] on March 4, 1885.<<hrBirth and familyhr>>Arthur was born on October 5, 1829 in [[Fairfield|Fairfield, Vermont]], [[Vermont]]. His [[mother]] was [[Malvina Stone]] and his [[father]] was [[William Arthur]]. His [[name]] came from [[Chester Abell]], the [[physician]] who aided the broth, and [[Alan Arthur]], his [[grandfather]] on his dad's side. He was born as the fifth of nine [[children]] from the Arthurs.&pHe had eight [[siblings|sibling]], with only seven who lived to [[adulthood]]:&spRegina (1822-1910, 88 years)&spJane (1824-1842, 18 years)&spAlmelda (1825-1899, 74 years)&spAnn (1828-1915, 87 years)&spMalvina (1832-1920, 88 years)&spWilliam (1834-1915, 81 years)&spGeorge (1836-1838, 2 years)&spMary (1841-1917, 76 years)<<hrVice presidency and presidencyhr>><<hr2Vice Presidencyhr2>>After running under the [[Republican]] party as a [[Stalwart]] and winning the [[1880 election|1880 United States Presidential Election]] with 7,018 [[votes|vote]] in the [[nationwide popular vote|United States nationwide popular vote]] and 214 to 155 in the [[Electoral College|United States Electoral College]], Chester A. Arthur was sworn in as the [[Vice President|Vice President of the United States]].&pThe [[Senate|United States Senate]] was currently divided between 37 [[Democrats|Democrat]], 37 Republicans, an independent, a [[Readjuster]], and four vacancies. Arthur voted in favor of Republicans on tie-breaking votes. Arthur had attempted to have Garfield appoint [[Stalwarts|Stalwarts]] onto positions such as the [[Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury of the United States]] to no avail. Garfield attempted to bring in people he favored into high positions, which locked the Senate. After two months, the Senate was put on recess.

<<hr2Assassinationhr2>>{{tMain page: [[Assassination of James A. Garfield]]}}&spDuring the recess, Arthur traveled to [[New York]], where on July 2, 1881, he got a call in [[Albany|Albany, New York]] that Garfield was shot. He was shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]], who made the following statement during the [[assassination]]:<<quoI am a Stalwart, and Arthur will be President!quo>>

<<hr2Ascentionhr2>>After the assassination, on September 22, Arthur re-took his oath and became [[Presisent|President of the United States]]. He quickly had trouble with the cabinet comprised of Garfield's making, who were from opposing Republican factions. Several members of the cabinet [[resigned|resignation]], where they were filled in with Arthur's supporters. In the [[Supreme Court|Supreme Court of the United States]], there were two vacancies in 1881 and 1882 when [[Associate Justice|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] [[Nathan Clifford]] died and Associate Justice [[Ward Hunt]] [[retired|retirement]]. Clifford was replaced by [[Horace Gray]]. Arthur nominated [[Roscoe Conkling]], who did not accept the position (the last time this would happen), who then tried to get [[George Edmunds]], who did not accept considerations, then finally nominated [[Samual Blatchford]], who accepted the role to replace Hunt.

<<hr2Service reformhr2>>On January 16, 1883, Arthur signed the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] after a poor election cycle for Republicans filled the [[House of Representatives|United States House of Representatives]] with Democrats, which convinced them to approve the act. Arthur was quick to bring people onto the new [[Civil Service Commission|United States Civil Service Commission]]. The [[goal]] was to award positions not based on connections, but rather [[merit]], which Arthur saw as a great success.

<<hr2Surplushr2>>Due to a surplus of $145 million (over $4.3 billion in today's money) in 1882, there was a debate between the Democrats (who wanted to reduce [[tariffs|tariff]]) and the Republicans (who wanted to spend more on [[internal improvements]] and cutting [[excise]] taxes). The South generally supported lowering tariffs but enjoyed tariffs on [[cotton]]. Arthur sided with the Republicans, wanting to reduce excise taxes and increase internal improvements. The [[Rivers and Harbors Act]] was going to be given $19 million by [[Congress|Congress of the United States]], which Arthur [[vetoed|veto]] to popular support, and then overturned and passed by Congress. Republicans admit this decision may have cost them seats for the upcoming 1882 election.

<<hr2Immigrationhr2>>Arthur supported the [[Immigration Act of 1882]], which taxed [[immigrants|immigrant]] 50 [[cents|cent]] to enter the US, alongside barring [[mentally|mental disorder]] and [[intellectually disabled|intellectual disability]], [[criminals|criminal]] and others based on their reliance on [[public services]]. [[Chinese]] were immigrating into the country, with roughly 250,000 immigrants in 1882. In 1868, the Senate signed the [[Burlingame Treaty]]. In 1879, there was an attempt to [[abrogate]] the [[treaty]] with the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was vetoed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. After revisions in the [[Angell Treaty of 1880]], there was another attempt to pass the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], which would have prevented Chinese from getting [[citizenship]] and stopped Chinese immigration for twenty years. Arthur vetoed the bill because it would violate the revision made two years earlier. After that was shot down, a new bill by the same name went through Congress, only banning immigration for ten years. Arthur did not like the barring from citizenship, but thought the compromise was fair, and signed the bill on May 6, 1882.

<<hr2Naval reformhr2>>
Following the [[American Indian Wars]], Congress became worried at the poor state of the [[Navy|United States Navy]], which had gone from 700 [[ships|ship]] to 52, many being outdated. [[William E. Chandler]] was appointed to an advisory board to [[modernize|modernization]] the Navy, who was influential in removing old ships made with [[wood]] and [[canvas]], alongside [[scrapping]] ships that [[cost]] more to [[repair]] than their [[value]]. Additionally, Chandler created the [[Naval War College]]. Arthur signed funds appropriated by Congress for the ships [[{{iAtlanta}}|USS Atlanta (1884)]], [[{{iBoston}}|USS Boston (1884)]], [[{{iChicago}}|USS Chicago (1885)]], and [[{{iDolphin}}|USS Dolphin (PG-24)]], a part of the [[{{iSquadron of Evolution}}|Squadron of Evolution]]. He also passed funding to rebuild the incomplete [[{{iAmphitrite}}|USS Amphitrite (BM-2)]], [[{{iMonadnock}}|USS Monadnock (BM-3)]], [[{{iPuritan}}|USS Puritan (BM-1)]], and [[{{iTerror}}|USS Terror (BM-4)]]. After [[Democrats]] won the [[48th Congress|48th United States Congress]], they opposed the plans for a new Navy and blocked funding for building several more ships.

<<hr2Civil rightshr2>>During Arthur's presidency, he attempted to win back [[disenfranchised|Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era]] blacks in [[the South|Southern United States]] as support for [[Republicans|Republican]] kept falling. However, the forming of the [[Readjuster Party]] in [[Virginia]]`,

[[Boo|Boo (Sunny Bunnies)]] and [[Iris|Iris (Sunny Bunnies)]] both catch an ornament, while [[Shiny|Shiny (Sunny Bunnies)]] gets a [[tiara]] and places it on her head. Boo runs into a small present, knocking a [[candy cane]] the size of him, which breaks when Boo grabs it. Hopper and Boo are then seen placing ornaments on the tree, with Boo accidentally wrapping Hopper's ears around a [[branch]] of the tree. Iris and Shiny (now without the tiara) are placing ornaments on the tree, before being chased away by Hopper on top of Boo. Iris and Shiny then join the stack to reach higher parts of the tree.&pTurbo, comparing the half-decorated tree and the photo, tells the other bunnies to continue. Boo grabs a tall [[step ladder]] as Hopper walks in on [[stilts]]. Meanwhile, Iris and Shiny stack presents on top of each other to reach higher. After Turbo views the photo again, he is [[shocked]] to see that the top half of the tree is decorated, but not the bottom. When the bunnies view the photo in Turbo's hands, they attempt to correct their mistake but only cover one side of the tree with ornaments. Turbo, enraged, has Iris and Shiny bring over two presents full of ornaments while grabbing a [[see saw]] as Boo brings the step ladder. The presents are placed onto one side of the see-saw, using Boo to launch them over the tree, covering the undecorated side. Hopper runs over with a [[star|tree topper]], while Turbo [[lassos|lasso]] the tree (with Boo's help) lowers the top to the ground.&pOn placement of the star, Boo releases the lasso, flinging the tree backwards, and launching the star. [[Fireworks]] then appear, causing the bunnies to admire them. After a transition, the park is shown to be littered with decorations as the group stands next to the tree, now barren of leaves. A single ornament left of the tree falls to the ground, as Shiny grabs a branch near where the ornament fell. Boo then follows suit, causing the tree to be covered in a thick layer of [[fur]] of the five colors of the bunnies.&pThe [[blooper]] reel first shows the bunnies running around the tree, touching it to change the color of the fur. After, it shows a [[clip]] of the bunnies stacked on top of each other and the moment the lasso was released, ending the episode.`,

The scythes are meant to be a combination of the [[sword|sword (Minecraft)]] and [[axe|axe (Minecraft)]], blending the axe's raw damage and the sword's sweeping ability. The scythe has the cooldown of an axe as well. A scythe can be made from wood, [[stone|cobblestone (Minecraft)]], [[iron|iron ingot (Minecraft)]], [[diamond|diamond (Minecraft)]], and [[netherite|Netherite (Minecraft)]]. A scythe can be crafted by placing 3 of the material on the top row of the crafting grid, and 2 [[sticks|stick (Minecraft)]] in the center and bottom right slots.

Conner101ful did so and sent that friend the recording.

His next appearance would be as [[Badsmoke the Monster|Badsmoke (Rufusboy69)]]. The video for this would later become private. The next piece of voice acting Conner101ful did was when that friend requested he make a voice recording of [[Shadow The Hedgehog]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA3Q34z5M7s (text=refCountref>> That was the last publically released instance of voice acting done by Conner101ful <<asofNovember 2024>>.<<hr2Game developmenthr2>><<hr3Early dayshr3>>As a young [[child]], Conner101ful dreamed of getting into game development. Eventually, much later in his life, Conner101ful would be made to use [[Scratch|Scratch (MIT)]] during one of his classes in school. His first ever game made using Scratch had been a barely functional [[clicker game]] centered around [[Champ99|Champ99 (Conner101ful)]] and his [[money]] [[factory]]. Champ99 would stick to Conner101ful's brain like glue. Future games would be centered around the character of Champ99 and this would later expand into a full-blown [[animated|animation]] series on scratch that never made it past 2 episodes and 3 parts of a 3rd episode. In addition to the Champ99 series, side series would be made that added to the lore. Those other side series would never see much development. After the creation of the 2nd episode of the Champ99 series, Conner would make his first playable game titled "Money Factory Mayhem". The game was a top-down [[bullet hell]] game. In this game, the player would play as the [[Scratch Cat|Scratch Cat (MIT)]] and would be tasked with dodging a series of simple patterns to progress the game. Later, development would begin on a much more refined variation of the game that was intended to have 6 bosses. That remake would be partially made but never completed. Instead, a new game was being developed called "Champ99 Project 1 ~ The Golden Amulet". This would see active development up until the first boss and was never picked up finished. This led to the development of the Scratch version of {{iChamp99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet}}, which would get no more than basic movement and a simplistic title screen. Currently, all the Scratch Champ99 projects made by Conner101ful are private.<<hr3Post-Scratchhr3>>During his junior year of [[high school]], Conner101ful would take a Computer Science Essentials class, taught by the person who would later make [[Pickcode]]. The class had started with block-based coding, which Conner101ful was quite familiar with from his experience in Scratch. His teacher helped Conner101ful out greatly when he wanted to go above and beyond on projects. Later, the class would move beyond the block coding and move into [[Python|Python (Programming Language)]]. Towards the end of the year, the class was tasked with making a final project. Conner101ful had remembered the Champ99 series and decided to bring it back. His project was intended to be a 1-stage [[demo|Game Demo]] of {{iChamp99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet}}. Conner101ful, ever the star shooter, hit the moon instead, only getting as far as a basic movement demo complete with a "focus mode", "power" mechanics, and two distinct shot types. This project would later receive more development during his senior year of high school as he was taking a Computer Science Principals class. In that class, he learned more about [[Pygame]], which aided in the development of this Champ99 game.<<hr3Post-high schoolhr3>>When the seniors of his high school were made to leave and prepare for the graduation ceremony, Conner101ful's development for the 1st installment of the Champ99 Project series would continue in [[Pycharm|Pycharm (IDE)]]. This development was continued until testing for the [[danmaku|bullet hell]] system for the game. Conner101ful would get incredibly frustrated with it as the game's frame rate would drop rapidly and the sprites for the bullets would become horrifically mangled. He would soon make the switch to the [[Godot|Godot (Game Engine)]]. Rebuilding the game from the ground up again went smoothly. <<AsofNovember 2024>>, the development of {{iChamp99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet}} is on pause. During the Post-high school stage of development, the lore for the [[Champ99 series|Champ99 Project (Conner101ful)]] would expand greatly. Conner101ful would also start production of the 4th and final installment of the Champ99 Project series, a book titled {{iChamp99 Project 4: To Hell and Back}}. The 4th installment of the series reuses and remasters the plot of the 3rd installment of the original Champ99 animated series Conner101ful made on Scratch. <<asofNovember 2024>>, this book is unfinished, but in its final stage of the [[first draft|Drafting (Writing)]]. During this era of his game development career Conner would also start working on a remastering of a {{i[[Minecraft]]}} mod he made between the Early Days era and Post-Scratch era.<<hr2YouTube channelhr2>>The name "Conner101ful" originally stemmed from the original Conner101ful YouTube channel owned by Conner. This channel would be made in 2012 and would consist mainly of {{i[[Minecraft]]}} and {{i[[Terraria]]}} content filmed from his [[Nintendo 3DS]] and uploaded to his channel from that very same console. Eventually, the content would move to being made from his computer. The original Conner101ful channel would be deleted due to the creator's own shame of his past works. The channel would soon be remade with the same name in early 2021.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/@conner101ful/videos (text=refCountref>> The videos, <<asofNovember 2024>>, consist of replay file recordings of his gameplay in {{i[[Touhou Project]]}}.<<hrConner Lorehr>><<img(src=git/conner101ful poses.png(cap=Conner101ful as seen in an appearance in a scrapped [[mod|Game Mod]] for {{i[[Friday Night Funkin]]}}.img>>"Conner Lore" refers to the lore surrounding Conner. Conner Lore is mainly an inside joke among his close friends that gets increasingly more absurd with every expansion of the lore. It started after the "Great Falling Out" where Conner left his previous friend group behind after a disagreement involving Conner101ful being seriously romantically attracted to and getting into a romantic relationship with the fictional character of [[Utsuho Reiuji|Utsuho Reiuji (Touhou Project)]]. During this period of Conner's life when he was settling himself in a new friend group that the Conner Lore began. At first, it began as Conner being a ghost because of his mic in a Discord call sounding like he was a considerable distance away. This spiraled into him being in [[The Backrooms]] and subsequently him transcending reality itself. Conner Lore continues to expand, such as the time he battled his [[.EXE|.EXE (Creepypasta)]] or dabbled in [[ice cream]] merchandising. When asked about his personal life, Conner101ful typically answers under the canon of Conner Lore. He does this because it amuses him.`,

But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse. The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's "Tell us about us" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery solved, by 4chan.

<<hrWestern Europehr>>
The economic history of Western Europe, particularly England, Ireland, and France, reveals an evolution defined by periods of modernization, transition, and challenges. Throughout the 16th century, England, Ireland, and France saw significant demographic shifts and economic developments. Ireland saw increased trade as it became a kingdom, England experienced a population boom, and France grappled with financial reform and severe inflation. Going into the 17th and 18th centuries, England's colonial ventures outpaced France's. Ireland was struggling under the dominance imposed by England as France continued to feel financial strain due to poor government spending and increasing inflation.&pThe Industrial Revolution led to a continued economic gain in England, being at the forefront of the revolution. Ireland was struck with the Great Famine and France was being shaken up by the French Revolution. As [[World War I]] and [[II|World War II]] brought upheaval to the entire region, England's industrial sector continued to strive forward. Ireland, now partitioned and pushing a policy of protectionism, faced stagnation during the wars. France endured significant setbacks from the wars, such as rapid inflation, [[Nazi]] occupation, and hindered food production.&pFollowing the wars, Western Europe saw a period of growth and recovery. Welfare and [[consumerism]] became prominent in England, Ireland, and France, as their participation in the [[European Economic Community]], and later, the [[European Union]], increased international trade. This was especially important for Ireland, allowing it to break free of having its main exporter the United Kingdom. The service industry started to dominate these nations, becoming the largest sector in all three countries. Challenges such as low GPDs and inflation persisted from the late 20th century into the early 2010s, most notably the [[Great Recession]]. Globalization was in full force by the 2020s, with England and France emerging as economic powerhouses. Meanwhile, Ireland utilized tax incentives to draw in corporations and to stimulate its economy.

<<hr216th centuryhr2>>
As the [[Middle Ages]] came to a close, the [[populations|population]] within the [[nations|nation]] exponentially grew. Ireland's separate economic communities would merge over the century as it became a kingdom, increasing trade with France and England. England's population boom pushed workers away from farmlands and toward the industrial sector, as sheep herding became a popular way to make income as wages stagnated. [[Deforestation]] in England led to the increased use of [[coal]], which would be fundamental for the [[Industrial Revolution]]. France, meanwhile, kept closer to its agricultural roots, despite [[inflation|economic inflation]] brought on by [[silver]] and [[gold]] harvested from the [[New World]], leading to [[monetary reforms|monetary reform]] at the end of the century.

<<hr3England's economic expansionhr3>><<img(src=git/1500 England Economy Chart.png(cap=A chart from 1500--1599 of the increase in [[price index]] and trade of agricultural and industrial goods as [[wages|wage]] decrease in England.<<ref(content=link|https://doi.org/10.1080/00708852.1978.10418952(text=refCountref>>img>>The population of England was increasing at a faster and faster pace throughout the 16th century, starting from 2.2 million in 1500 and nearly doubling to over 4 million in 1599, an 84% total increase.<<ref(content=link|https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-england-millennium(text=refCountref>> This boom was unable to be easily absorbed into [[farms|farm]] and fields as [[wages|wage]] steadily decreased. Land was also becoming more scarce, increasing [[rent]] for large plots, and making agriculture less profitable. The newly growing industrial sector absorbed more workers, allowing it to increase its growth rate compared to agriculture, especially when the average man's wage was lessening by the year. This population growth is considered to be the primary factor behind the economic rise of England.<<ref(content=link|https://doi.org/10.1080/00708852.1978.10418952(text=refCountref>>&pThere were additional factors at play, alongside the population boom, that advanced industry in England. An example can be drawn to [[coal]], which was an increasingly popular fuel. [[Deforestation]] had made [[wood]], especially [[firewood]], [[scarce]] and [[expensive]]. Coal, on the other hand, was becoming more abundant as [[mining practices|coal mining]] became more modern.<<note(content=From the 11th to 15th century, coal was originally found and harvested off the shores of England.

It wasn't solely a job by [[farmers|farmer]], but by [[lawyers|lawyer]], [[industrialists|industrialist]], and [[politicians|politician]] during the time. It became so expansive that there were even attempts to curb the popularity of sheep herding, such as an act in 1533 that made it [[illegal]] to have a flock above 2400 sheep (with exceptions)<<ref(content=link|https://vlex.co.uk/vid/tillage-act-1533-808479969(text=refCountref>> and a statute in 1555 that had farmers own a minimum number of [[cows|cow]] based on how much sheep they have. However, the consolidation of sheep ownership increased over the 16th century in England, with fewer and fewer people owning small collections of sheep. By the end of the century, the peasantry was much less likely to herd sheep, with medium-sized developers and lords taking the reins.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20230409104627/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-81676-7_1(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3Ireland and kingdomhoodhr3>>
Ireland had been slowly losing influence from England, with Ireland becoming nearly autonomous by the end of the 15th century. During the early 16th century, there were two "different" economies co-existing: a rural Gaelic economy based on [[milk products|milk product]], [[oats|oat]], [[wheat]], [[corn]], and [[animals|animal]] such as [[pigs|pig]] and [[sheep]], and a more interconnected English economy based on wheat and [[barley]] on larger fields alongside [[livestock]]. Gaelic communities were thin-spread between [[lordships|lordship]], with little to no [[coinage]] and limited exporting of goods. Meanwhile, the English communities were much more keen to export goods to France and England and import more luxurious items. 
As the population of Englishmen decreased in Ireland, Gaelic peasants took up jobs in the field, and in turn, Gaelic communities slowly adopted the English coinage.<<ref(content=link|https://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/economy-and-society-1500-1690(text=refCountref>>
&pIreland, when in trade, had an economy based on [[raw materials|raw material]], such as [[fish]] and [[animal skins|animal skins]]. However, as the century continued, there was a noticeable increase in exporting [[cloth]] and [[clothing]] while fish exports decreased. Imports to Ireland showed an increase in cloths and [[metals|metal]] with a decrease in [[foodstuffs]] over the forty years. It tends towards an increase in industrialization throughout the first half of the 16th century. Using [[records]] of [[merchant ships|merchant ships]] to and from [[Bristol]], a vital [[port city]] for trade with Ireland, a clearer picture of Ireland's economy during this time can be made.<<ref(content=link|https://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/History/Ireland/research.htm(text=refCountref>><<note(content=Values based on &pnd sterling.(text=noteCountnote>>&p<<table{{bExports}}|{{b{{c1503}}}}|{{b{{c1516}}}}|{{b{{c1541}}}}|{{b{{c1542}}}}|{{b{{c1545}}||Fish|{{r2466&sp71%}}|{{r2101&sp55%}}|{{r1346&sp31%}}|{{r708&sp26%}}|{{r954&sp33%}}||Skins|{{r447&sp13%}}|{{r797&sp21%}}|{{r476&sp11%}}|{{r521&sp19%}}|{{r595&sp21%}}||Cloth & clothing|{{r429&sp12%}}|{{r524&sp55%}}|{{r2432&sp56%}}|{{r1404&sp51%}}|{{r1210&sp42%}}||[[Misc|Miscellaneous]]|{{r149&sp4%}}|{{r343&sp9%}}|{{r94&sp2%}}|{{r110&sp4%}}|{{r113&sp4%}}||[[Illegible]]|{{r0&sp0%}}|{{r23&sp1%}}|{{r0&sp0%}}|{{r0&sp0%}}|{{r0&sp0%}}||{{bTOTAL}}|{{r3490}}|{{r3788}}|{{r4348}}|{{r2743}}|{{r2872}}table>>&sp

&spThe [[Kingdom of Ireland]] was established by the Parliament of Ireland and declared by King Henry VIII in 1542. This creation of a [[kingdom]] would sew the seeds of a more interconnected economy in England. During this period, the economy of Ireland was almost entirely exporting goods to England and nearby nations. It is believed that this reliance on England was made to force Ireland to remain subservient, with the political, commercial, and industrial interests of England overriding those of Ireland.<<ref(content=link|https://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/History/Ireland/research.htm(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3French exploration and downturnhr3>>France, during this time, was the most populous country in [[Europe]]. With a population of 16.4 million at the start of the century, growing to 20 million by the end, it was packed full of people.<<ref(content=link|http://markgreengrass.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Appendix-5.pdf(text=refCountref>> In a similar situation to England, land was becoming increasingly scarce. [[Feudalism]] was starting to wane in France as the middle class pushed against [[lords|lord]] and [[nobles|noble]].&pAgriculture was the dominant driving force behind France's economy at the time, producing [[melons|melon]], [[romaine lettuce]], [[artichokes|artichoke]], [[celery]], and other [[fruits|fruit]] and [[vegetables|vegetable]] alongside [[olive oil]], [[wine]], [[saffron]], and [[cider]]. [[King Francis I|Francis I]], rising to power in 1515 started sponsoring explorations to the [[New World]]. [[Crops|crop]] harvested and brought back to France, such as [[corn]], [[beans|bean]], [[tomatoes|tomato]], and [[potatoes|potato]], also were pushed into the economy. [[Colonies|French colonization of the Americas]] were also set up in the [[Americas]], such as in [[Canada]], modern-day [[United States]], and [[Brazil]]. [[Paris]], [[Rouen]], and [[Lyon]] became major [[cities|city]] filled with [[markets|market]] and trade. Imported goods included [[silk]], [[glass]], [[wool]], and [[dyes|dye]]. France traded with nations around it, such as England, [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[Netherlands]].&p[[Silver]] and [[gold]] quickly plummeted in value, being imported from [[Africa]] and the Americas, which in conjunction with an increasing population and a stagnation in wages, caused rapid [[inflation|economic inflation]] in France. [[Crop failures|crop failure]], [[epidemics|epidemic]], and the [[French Wars of Religion]] decreased the transport of goods. The [[scorched earth]] strategy adopted during the time caused crops and [[villages|village]] to be torched and razed, causing citizens to flee and reduce trade further. This downturn would start to improve in the last decade of the century as the [[weather]] improved and [[Henry IV|Henry IV of France]] passed [[monetary reforms|monetary reform]].

<<hr2Pre-Industrial Revolutionhr2>>This period from 1600 to the 1760s was a continued push away from agriculture and drew towards industrialization. England pushed colonialism across the Americas, with France's attempts underperforming compared to England's. New World crops became prominent staples of agriculture, such as [[corn]] and [[potatoes|potato]]. Ireland was stuck relying on England for trade, oppressed by high rents and poor crop yields. France's currency inflated over the period as Louis XIV plunged the nation into debt with massive projects.

<<hr3English colonialismhr3>><<img(src=git/17-18 century England.jpg(cap=Graphs representing the decline in agriculture and increase in industry from mid-16th to mid-18th century England.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420141/(text=refCountref>>img>>England after 1600 saw a shift out of agriculture, making it become more modest. From the 16th to 17th century, farming shares fell from 66% down to 43%, while the share of the workforce in industry rose from 22% to 31% and services grew from 12% to 26%. This shift started in the early 17th century leading directly to the Industrial Revolution.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420141/(text=refCountref>> Trade was also a prominent facet of the English economy, expanding their influence through the building of a robust trading network with [[merchants|merchant]], [[manufacturers|manufacture]], financers, and shippers.&pThe [[East India Company]] was formed by prominent merchants and explorers. In 1599, the group went to [[Queen Elizabeth I|Elizabeth I]] asking for &pnd30,133.<<ref(content=link|https://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/east-indies-china-japan/vol2/pp99-102(text=refCountref>> This first attempt failed, but after a second attempt in 1600, the group succeeded in getting the royal investment.  Despite initial struggles to break even, the company managed to get a foothold in [[India]], expanding throughout the region to [[Asia]]. The purchase of [[slaves|slave]] from [[Madagascar]] in the late 17th century showed that the East India Company also profited from the [[slave trade]] at the time.<<ref(content=link|https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1153&context=slisconnecting(text=refCountref>>&pEngland also started participating in the exploration of the New World, mainly in [[North America]]. The [[colonies in Virginia|Colony of Virginia]], notably [[Jamestown|Jamestown, Virginia]], started slow because of adversity shown by the native [[Algonquian Indians]] and a lack of [[food]]. The more [[aristocratic]] population of Jamestown who focused on valuable materials were unable or unwilling to farm, causing food shortages and requiring pillaging from Indian reserves.<<ref(content=link|https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&amppsid=3574(text=refCountref>> [[Tobacco]] became a widely profitable [[cash crop]] of the colony as it grew. The most well-known colonial expansion was the [[Thirteen Colonies]], [[fishing]] and harvesting tobacco, [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[indigo]], and other crops to be sold to England. England thusly imported glass, [[linen]], [[machinery]], and household goods to the colonies and collected [[tax]], increasing the profits earned. This rapid expansion also led to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. These American colonies would later start [[breaking away|American Revolution]] in the 1960s, starting the [[American Revolutionary War]] during the Industrial Revolution.&pThis push for [[colonialism]] defined England's economy, using colonies that relied on England for supplies as they traded off resources produced in these colonies to make massive profits. Gold and silver were found in troves, as profitable crops such as [[sugarcane]], cotton, rice, and tobacco were sold by the boatload. This interconnected trade between England and the [[world|Earth]] would continue far into the Industrial Revolution, the next major shakeup in the English economy.

<<hr3Irish reliancehr3>>Ireland remained mostly unchanged between 1600 and 1760s, continuing to trade with England. Fishing, farming, and livestock management were still core pillars of Ireland's economy. However, trade restrictions from England made small towns flounder and left many estates across the lands.<<ref(content=link|https://www.britannica.com/place/Ireland/Social-economic-and-cultural-life-in-the-17th-and-18th-centuries(text=refCountref>> Farms adapted to the New World crops, notably potatoes as a primary source of food, as England purchased wheat and corn from farmers who used the income to make the increasing rent.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ighm.org/content/dam/ighm/documents/Student%20Newspaper%20Final.pdf(text=refCountref>> Ireland was reliant on trade with England, having little economic growth during the period as England extended their power over the nation. The [[Irish Famine of 1740--1741|Irish Famine (1740--1741)]], caused by terrible weather, was another major blow to Ireland, with up to 20% of the population of 2.4 million people being wiped out over the [[famine]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/dancing-on-ice-recalling-the-great-frost-of-1740/36663457.html(text=refCountref>> Overall, Ireland's economy stagnated as farmers could barely afford rent and food supplies kept dwindling.

<<hr3French taxation and spendinghr3>>The economic policies set by [[Henry IV]], including better [[coinage]], [[debt reduction]], and easing taxes on the [[peasantry]], continued under [[Louis XIII]]. When [[Louis XIV]] came to power, he pushed forth a [[military conquest]] and oversaw the building of the [[Palace of Versailles]], both requiring loads of [[money]]. New tax systems, including the "capitation" which taxed all people, regardless of status, and "dixième" which taxed based on [[property value]], were thusly put into place to allow increased governmental spending for these projects. These taxes, however, were rife with exceptions and had a history of spotty enforcement.<<ref(content=link|http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/MorrissonSnyder2000.pdf(text=refCountref>>&pThe [[French East India Company]] was created to compete with the English and the Dutch in the area, importing goods such as [[fur]], [[pepper]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]], and [[sugar]], despite being unsuccessful. Other colonies, such as their eastern American and Brazilian colonies, also didn't create large profits for France. Louis XIV would then issue the [[edict]] known as the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685. This edict revoked the previous 1958 [[Edict of Nantes]], leading to a mass [[expulsion]] of over 200,000 [[Huguenots]] (French [[Protestants|Protestantism]]). Many of these Huguenots, however, were highly skilled workers, who shut down their [[businesses|business]] and left for England, Ireland, [[Denmark]], and other countries.&pTaxes continued to fail to gain much income from [[churches|church]] and [[nobles|noble]], putting much of the burden onto the peasantry. International trade was severely limited because of the increased border protection brought on by the continuous wars. Bad harvests and [[starvation]] killed a tenth of the population at the end of the 17th century, as the value of metals and coinage continued to decrease. Drawing into the 18th century, [[paper currencies|paper currency]] were attempted multiple times, failing and eroding confidence in the French currency.<<ref(content=link|https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hyper.htm#LAW(text=refCountref>> However, after the death of Louis XIV, trade reopened, especially profiting off of new [[Caribbean]] colonies. Agriculture was still reliant on wheat, as potatoes and corn had limited availability regarding suitable land for the crops. If anything were to happen to the French's wheat availability, it would spell disaster. Overall, France was taking on severe debt as their currency kept inflating, having limited skilled labor and stuck relying on a few uniform foods going into the Industrial Revolution.

<<hr2Industrial Revolution to World War Ihr2>>This period from the 1760s to 1914 was defined by the rapid growth of the industrial sector in Western Europe. England, the origin of the [[Industrial Revolution]], profited significantly during this period. England's transition to [[capitalism]], the use of mechanical [[inventions|invention]] that reduced labor, and a growing [[working class]] defined the economy throughout the revolution. Ireland, united with England and stuck with a famine got much less out of the revolution, leading to little growth in Ireland's economy. France modernized over the 19th century following the [[French Revolution]], propelled by the propagation of railroads, new tax and land reforms, and increased investments in growing industry.

<<hr3England and the Industrial Revolutionhr3>>The Industrial Revolution was sparked by a mix of factors: the available [[canals|canal]], [[ports|port]], and [[roads|road]], excess [[manpower]] and food, a plentiful supply of [[coal]] and [[iron]], and a system that favored the creation of businesses. Substituting [[charcoal]] for [[coke|coke (fuel)]] greatly decreased the cost of producing [[iron]], with larger [[blast furnaces|blast furnace]] becoming available. [[Steam engines|steme engine]] and [[steam locomotives|steam locomotive]] at the turn of the 19th century, revolutionized [[transportation|rail transportation]]. [[Cotton-spinning machinery]] and the [[power loom]] created a whole new field of workers in [[factories|factory]] as more people left agriculture for industrial work. [[Machine tools|machine tool]], including the [[screw-cutting lathe]], the [[milling machine|milling (manufacturing)]], and the [[boring machine|boring (manufacturing)]], were developed, allowing for a more efficient manufacturing process. This was in addition to the new system of [[capitalism]], proposed by [[Adam Smith]], which quickly grew in favor of the old [[mercantilism]]. England was in the right place at the right time, making it become the [[{{ide facto}}]] trading nation.&pEngland had lost its largest colony in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775--1783), but the impact of losing it was not nearly felt as hard as expected. The empire realized that there was no major benefit to trading with nations that were [[sovereign]] compared to those that weren't. The [[Colonies|Colonial United States]] still was a major trade partner of England, despite the war. England would still partake in a 2nd wave of colonialism, known as [[imperialism]], using nations to harvest [[tropical crops|tropical crop]] to sell and trade. England's East India Company would push competition out of [[India]] during the 19th century, before dissolving in 1874. [[Asia]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]] were also major imperialized regions during the century.&pFrom 1780 to 1870, England was the leading nation, surpassing the [[Netherlands]] (the previous leading European country) by 20%, while flying by France and [[Germany]] by a staggering 70%. Agriculture was taking up a less significant share of the nation's labor, going from 45% in 1780 to half by 1870 (22.7%), before getting halved again by 1913 (11.8%). This growth is not attributed to investments in land or labor, but rather the improvements in [[technology]] and the increased [[efficiency]] in production. The [[urbanization]] of England compared to France and the increased [[free trade]], despite the smaller population, pushed England ahead in the Industrial Revolution.<<ref(content=link|https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.12.2.193(text=refCountref>><<note(content=GDP and GDP/Person based on $1990 [[international billion|international dollar]].(text=noteCountnote>>&p<<table|{{b{{c1780}}}}|{{b{{c1820}}}}|{{b{{c1870}}}}|{{b{{c1913}}}}||[[GDP|Gross domestic product]]|{{r15.2}}|{{r29.6}}|{{r95.6}}|{{r214.5}}||[[GDP/Person|Gross domestic product per capita]]|{{r1782}}|{{r2099}}|{{r3263}}|{{r5023}}||Agricultural Employment|{{r45%}}|{{r35%}}|{{r22.7%}}|{{r11.8%}}table>>&spDespite lagging behind the [[United States]] and Germany, England at the turn of the 20th century was still the global leader in trading, financing, and shipping, while also having large stakes in manufacturing and mining. The empowerment of the [[working class]] had come to a head, with a growing [[Labor Party]] gaining a hold in the [[Parliament|Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The low [[unemployment rates|unemployment rate]] gave [[unions|trade union]] [[bargaining power]] for [[higher wages|wage increase]] and increased [[job stability]]. This led to a marginal increase in wages and a [[national minimum wage]] for most laborious professions.

<<hr3Union, famine, and Irelandhr3>>Ireland had a brief boom from the 1760s to the 19th century caused by spillover from the Industrial Revolution.<<ref(content=link|https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/3854/98p035.pdf(text=refCountref>> The [[Kingdom of Ireland]] then underwent a union with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1801 to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During this period, Ireland would mainly produce [[raw materials|raw material]], such as [[timber]] and [[marble]] to the increasingly industrialized British economy. However, Ireland was still economically weak and dependent on England. Plots became smaller to the point where potatoes were the sole major crop to feed families. In the 1840s, when the [[Great Famine|Great Famine (Ireland)]] hit, devastating these potato fields, it left a massive scar on Ireland that can still be seen today. The widespread [[starvation]] and [[emigration|Emigration from Ireland during the Great Famine]] from Ireland prevented the building of a home market for industry as the population shrunk. Over a million died during the famine, with an additional 1.3 million emigrating throughout.<<ref(content=link|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6735970/(text=refCountref>> This famine stagnated industrialization in Ireland, keeping most of the economy focused on agriculture up until it split into [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

<<hr3French modernizationhr3>><<img(src=git/france england gdp economy.png(cap=The real GDP per capita in France and the United Kingdom from the late 1700s to the late 1900s.<<ref(content=link|https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c7431/c7431.pdf(text=refCountref>>img>>France was undertaking a large portion of the growing debt from Louis XIV, with [[Louis XV]] not aiding the continued downturn. When [[Louis XVI]] came to power, the increasing debt forced him into permitting radical reforms, however, they did little to change the worsening situation. Despite supporting the American Revolution with money and supplies, they got little in return from the [[Treaty of Paris in 1783|Treaty of Paris (1783)]]. Significant price crashes of agricultural prices and terrible winters between 1785 and 1789 only added insult to injury, skyrocketing the price of wheat and [[bread]]. Taxes were once again raised to no avail.&pThe [[French Revolution]] brought on by the economic hardships and government corruption led to the abolishment of [[feudalism]] and the rule of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/french-revolution(text=refCountref>> The economy of France was highly unstable during this period, but it also laid the groundwork for modern economic practices, such as land reforms. Similarly to England, more farm jobs were transferred to the growing industrial sector, even if it was at a snail's pace compared to other European nations such as [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]].&pThe 1850s saw a major investment in [[railroads|railroad]], decreasing the cost of transport as France kept playing catch-up during the Industrial Revolution. France also lagged in [[coal|coal mining]] and [[iron mining]], but its agricultural sector held strong with improved [[livestock]] management, increased investments, and a railroad system, stabilizing food prices since the French Revolution. In the back half of the 1800s, economic downturn and depression struck again, exasperated by the still dominating agricultural industry and slow demographic growth. By the end of the century leading into the 1900s, healthy economic growth returned with investment in [[automobiles|automobile]] and [[electricity]].

<<hr2The World Warshr2>>The [[First World War|World War I]] started in 1914, kicking off a conflict that affected nearly every major economy. During the downtime between 1919 and 1938, unemployment and stagnation were common, with the Great Depression preventing much change. The [[Second World War|World War II]] (1939--1945) followed, again impacting all major economies across the globe. England saw a further increase in industrialization, influenced by the wars. Ireland's partition into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland led to continued stagnation in the Republic while Northern Ireland profited off the war. France was continually devastated by the damages in WWI, rapid inflation, the Great Depression, and Nazi occupation during WWII, effectively stopping all growth in the nation.

<<hr3English war productionhr3>>During WWI, economic production was drastically cut to create [[munitions|munition]] for the British forces. Throughout the war, England was spending &pnd4,000,000 on war efforts,<<ref(content=link|https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/13/benito-mussolini-recruited-mi5-italy(text=refCountref>> taking out [[loans|loan]] from the [[United States]] to help support the spending. The industrial sector, creating shells, aircraft, and other munitions and vehicles continued to grow during the period, supported by an increase in taxation<<ref(content=link|https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/taxation/overview/firstworldwar/(text=refCountref>><<note(content=The rate of income tax in England rose from 6% in 1914 to 30% in 1918.(text=noteCountnote>> and foreign loans. During the war, trade unions grew in size and women were also transferred from the [[home|housewife]] to the factory floor. Overall, England's economy remained stable throughout the war with the GDP growing throughout.<<ref(content=link|https://books.google.com/books?id=06KYLGALKNEC&amppg=PA370#v=onepage&q&f=false(text=refCountref>>&p{{i% GDP based on 1913}}<<table{{b{{c1913}}}}|{{b{{c1914}}}}|{{b{{c1915}}}}|{{b{{c1916}}}}|{{b{{c1917}}}}|{{b{{c1918}}}}||{{r100.0%}}|{{r101.0%}}|{{r109.1%}}|{{r111.5%}}|{{r112.5%}}|{{r113.7%}}table>>&spDespite an initial boom after the war, unemployment rose and the economy stagnated during the interwar period in England. The decade following WWI had little growth, followed by the [[Great Depression]] in 1929. The early 1930s were plagued by the Depression, shaking up the industrial industry that grew during the war. However, during this period, the consumer industry rebounded toward the end of the decade going into the Second World War. WWII saw England return to a shift of highly efficient government-backed industrial production of munitions. England was able to mobilize its [[home front]] during the war, optimizing industrial output. The economy would hold throughout the war, but it would yet again lead to a period of a weakened English economy afterward.

<<hr3Irish partitionhr3>>Ireland had little growth during WWI, with most involvement being in the recruitment of soldiers for the United Kingdom and not in the production of goods to support the effort. After the war, the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919--1921) had started. The War of Independence was relatively short, ending in a victory for Ireland, creating the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 out of 26 of the 32 [[counties in Ireland]] (later becoming the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1937). The remaining 6 counties closest to England would stay in the United Kingdom as [[Northern Ireland]]. The agriculture-based Ireland and economic isolation from Northern Ireland and England in the 1930s led to further stagnation. Northern Ireland, tied to England, kept a steady growth after the partition.&pWWII continued the disparity between Ireland and Northern Ireland, with Ireland taking a firm stance of [[neutrality|Irish neutrality during World War II]] and not profiting off the war. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland went from having a serious unemployment problem to a [[labor shortage]] at the start of the war. [[Belfast]], the capital of Northern Ireland, produced [[ships|ship]], [[tanks|tank]], and munitions, continuing to profit off of English trade throughout the war. This economic boom helped to alleviate the stagnation seen before the partition.

<<hr3French devastationhr3>>France, a major target of [[Germany]] during WWI, had suffered severely from the German occupation throughout the war. The loss of manpower and machinery inflated the price of food as agricultural production fell. English and American aid were vital for France during the war, as France was plunged into war damages and debt. Farmland and livestock were ruined and lost, railways, factories, and mines were destroyed, and 1.4 million soldiers were killed.<<ref(content=link|http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm(text=refCountref>> Inflation was the most prominent issue in France during the interwar period, fuelled by government borrowing and the increase in circulating money. Economic reforms and stabilization in the late 1920s would be in vain when the Great Depression hit France. Despite being milder compared to the effects of the Great Depression in the United States and England, it also lasted longer as France held onto its [[gold standard]] up until 1936.&pFrance in WWII was yet again a major target of [[Nazi Germany]], [[falling|Battle of France]] in June of 1940. The [[Vichy France]] was stripped of millions of workers and their food supply while Germany also demanded massive cash payments. The consistent lack of available food during the war caused by the German seizure of large portions of produced food, reduced farm production, and mismanagement of rations, led to the formation of a [[black market|Black market in wartime France]], further reducing the supply of commercial foods and devastating the economy.<<ref(content=link|https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20672479/(text=refCountref>> [[Forced labor]] was also present during this period, with nearly a million French [[POWs|prisoner of war]] used in forced labor by Nazi Germany. It would only be after the war and the reconstruction of France that its situation would improve.

<<hr2Post-World Warshr2>>After the Second World War, many countries in Western Europe started to bounce back with large post-war growth and deindustrialization. Low unemployment, increased welfare, and the spread of [[consumerism]] were prevalent in the 1950s and '60s after the war, especially in England and France. Mining and manufacturing became less prioritized by governments in the region as the service sector expanded. The European Union allowed for an influx of trade between countries, which especially aided Ireland's escape from its direct reliance on the UK for trade. Inflation and low GDPs appeared at the end of the 20th century to the early 2000s, with globalization and the spread of corporations across the world again pushing forth the service sector. England and France both became some of the wealthiest countries up to the present off of their expansive industry and exports as Ireland utilized tax exemptions to surge corporate interest and to stimulate its economy.

<<hr3Deindustrialization in Englandhr3>>England, unlike other Western European countries, was not as hard hit by the war. In the 1950s and 60s, England experienced post-war growth characterized by an improved [[quality of life|life quality]].

However, unlike countries with previously agricultural-dominating economies, including France, [[Italy]], and [[Spain]], England didn't get a wave of further industrialization because it was already industrialized and even started to "deindustrialized" during the sixties and seventies.&pEngland had a reduced manufacturing output caused by deindustrialization in mining and manufacturing, going from an output of over 20% in the 1870s and 13.6% in 1913 to 4.9% in 1973.<<ref(content=link|https://www.google.com/books/edition/War_in_Human_Civilization/S6gSDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&amppg=PA519&ampprintsec=frontcover(text=refCountref>> Coal was becoming less valuable as [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] were used more in industry, leading to a decrease of nearly 100 million [[tonnes|metric ton]] of mined coal from 1900 to the 1970s.<<ref(content=link|https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption(text=refCountref>> Employment in steel decreased as railways and [[textile mills|textile mill]] closed down.

France continued to decrease trade restrictions and modernize industries as the US kept giving loans and funds to the nation.

<<hrNorthern South Americahr>>The economic history of Northern South America is defined by large periods of change, connection, and innovation. The first three centuries are known for the colonization that dominated the lands. The Spanish Empire covered the areas of Colombia and Peru, while the Portuguese had a stake in their colonies in modern-day Brazil. These colonizers were the sole beneficiaries of this forced agreement, harvesting valuable metals and gemstones. Sugar and tobacco were vital cash crops used to keep these colonies profitable even after being stripped of non-renewable resources.&pIn the 19th century, a wave of independence over the region would take place, creating defined nations not constrained by a kingdom above. Mining and agriculture were still staple exports, but different nations relied on different niches. Colombia fell back on coffee and tobacco, Peru had seabird [[guano]], and Brazil took up coffee and [[natural rubber]]. Through the first half of the 20th century, industrialization became a major policy strived by those in the region. Despite setbacks in international trade caused by the global wars, the [[United States]] had directed trade between Northern South American countries, linking them irreversibly together in imports and exports.&pThe latter half of the 1900s to today is a continued push for economic independence from Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, using decentralization as a goal to reduce this reliance. Colombia increased its economic and political stability, growing the private sector while pushing forth oil production. Colombia recently capitalized on a market of cut [[flowers|flower]], greatly contributing to its market of agriculture, mining, and industry. Peru, after undergoing multiple [[coups|coup]] and instability, started growing economically at the turn of the century. Peru also partakes in agriculture as their GDP soared. Brazil at the end of the 20th century saw major spikes in inflation caused by their reliance on the US and increasing debt from the government. Brazil is one of the more diverse nations in the region, not only hosting agriculture and mining but also an expansive industrial sector. The Northern South American region is currently predicted to continue growing throughout the 21st century.

<<hr2Colonizationhr2>>The New World was opened up by the Prior to colonization, the region was dominated by agriculture and [[bartering]] of goods such as [[clothing]], [[pottery]], and [[jewelry]]. There was Hunting natural wildlife was also a common practice during this time. The [[Inca]] in Peru even had a tax system where crops and labor, instead of coinage, would be exchanged to meet taxes. The New World was opened by the [[Spaniards|Spain]] and [[Portuguese|Portugal]] through their expeditions in the Americas, pursuing a conquest of land and resources for expansion, including Colombia, Peru, and Brazil in the early 16th century. Natives in Northern South America were culturally and ethnically stripped if not endangered through their colonization efforts.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20100327090558/http://www.eremite.demon.co.uk/Tairona/1pages/seca/a2tsatconq.html(text=refCountref>> It would be until the 19th century that independence would be won, allowing for an economy not solely made to benefit colonizers.

<<hr3Spanish colonization of Colombia and Peruhr3>><<img(src=git/spanish colonization of peru.jpg(cap=A [[drawing]] of [[Francisco Hernández Girón]], a Spanish {{iencomiendor}} in Peru, by [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]] in the 1530s.img>>Despite fierce resistance, Spaniards were able to colonize Colombia and Peru with the benefit of better food, healthcare, intellect, and especially [[firearms|firearm]], into successfully colonizing the lands.<<ref(content=link|https://www.peruinformation.org/colonial-period(text=refCountref>> As the Spaniards came to the New World with the goal of maximizing the profit of the newly discovered land, they prioritized the extraction of valuable materials, including [[gold]] and [[copper]]. The indigenous peoples were subject to [[forced labor]] and [[dehumanization]], with many [[killed|human killing of a human]] by the colonizers. Spain had monopolized all trade with the colonies, giving complete domination over Colombia and Peru. While the colonies exported valuable metals, they received imports from Spain including manufactured goods and [[African slaves|Slavery in Africa]].&pThe Spanish labor system known as {{i[[encomienda]]}} benefited [[conquistadors|conquistador]] with the labor of the colonized peoples. In return, the colonized peoples were supposed to benefit from [[education]] and [[protection|military protection]], however, that was rarely the case. Most, if not all, {{iencomiendors}} used their position to [[enslave|slavery]] those under their control. This encouraged the exploration of the New World between 1500 and 1540. In 1542, Spain passed the [[New Laws]] to try and prevent further abuses, such as requiring {{iencomiendors}} to free the Native Americans and that all land would return to the Crown on the death of the {{iencomiendor}}. There was plenty of resistance by those who benefited from forced labor, especially in Peru. The News Laws' enforcement was spotty at best, with attempts to free the slaves being little more than feckless gestures.<<ref(content=link|https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/americas/article/why-indigenous-slavery-continued-in-spanish-america-after-the-new-laws-of-1542/3189EAB5FBC018DBE89AE97B07AFC5D7(text=refCountref>> By the 17th and 18th centuries, the practice fell out of popularity due to the lack of formal support and improving standards for non-Christians under the Spanish empire.&pAgriculture throughout the 1500s was primarily to feed the workers and colonists, especially because the relatively few ships limited exports to high-value low-volume goods. As trade and [[seafaring]] became more prominent toward the 1600s, food also became an export from the colonies. [[Sugar]] and [[tobacco]] were popular crops to produce and food became a pillar of Colombia's economy in the 1700s. This growth in agriculture over two centuries was due to the decline in available nonrenewable resources with the mining equipment at the time. African slaves became prominent replacements for the locals in the 17th century, especially in mining. When agriculture became more profitable, slaves were transferred to the fields, despite the increasing cost. The purchase of slaves fell out of favor in the 18th century, but it would only be in the 19th century with the independence of Colombia and Peru that slavery would be abolished.

<<hr3Portuguese colonization of Brazilhr3>>Portugal, searching for a source of goods for the European market, competed with Spain in the Americas after the discovery of the New World. Portugal attempted to adopt a similar strategy in Brazil to what the Spaniards did in Colombia and Peru: extract rare metals from the earth. To their dismay, gold wouldn't be found until the 18th century. The trade of {{i[[pau-brasil|Paubrasilia]]}} (also known as brazilwood), a red [[wood]] popular for its [[dyeing|dye]] capabilities, initially kept the economy of the infant colony afloat.<<ref(content=link|https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/centralandsouthamerica/brazil/riodejaneiro/fdrs_feat_129_9.html?pagewanted=1(text=refCountref>>&pAs [[deforestation]] required labor to head inland, it became increasingly ideal to rely on agriculture near the [[coastline]]. "Traditional" agriculture of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] would be unprofitable because of the added expense of shipping a crop that was already produced in Europe. Sugar became the ideal crop to harvest, especially because [[mills|sugar mill]] and [[plantations|sugar plantation]] had already been put into place by the early colonizers.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20200926175933/http://www.ibrac.net/index.php/o-ibrac/historico(text=refCountref>> Commonly known as the [[Brazilian sugar cycle]], this cultivation and processing of [[sugarcane]] became the economic backbone of the colonies. The African slave trade aided in obtaining the necessary laborers required to keep up with the expanding boom in sugar production in the colony. Portugal's alliance with the [[Dutch|Holland]] allowed them to [[monopolize|monopoly]] the sale of sugar, with Portugal facilitating the production and the Dutch the trade.&pAfter being put under the rule of Spain in 1581,<<ref(content=link|https://unacademy.com/content/upsc/study-material/general-awareness/a-short-history-of-spain-and-portugal/(text=refCountref>> Portugal was roped into the [[Eighty Years' War]] against its formerly allianced Holland, in which they occupied Brazil in the mid-17th century. Even after being driven out in 1654, the Dutch had gained the knowledge of how to produce their own sugar and created colonies in the [[Caribbean]], undermining colonial Brazil's former monopoly. [[Cattle ranching]] was vital to keeping the colony from collapsing as sugar dove in price, causing Brazil to be unable to participate in the market as all its resources were used to sustain itself. Coffee was also being grown in Brazil, but it remained a domestic product until the 19th century. Rolling into the 18th century, the colony was blessed with the discovery of large [[veins|ore vein]] of gold and other precious [[gemstones|gemstone]], allowing the colony to stay economically viable for Portugal to the next century.

<<hr2Independencehr2>>In the 19th century, many nations within the colonized Americas increased fighting for independence from their colonial rulers, such as Colombia and Peru under Spain and Brazil under Portugal. These nations would all gain full independence in the 1820s, when they each attempted to develop their economies during the turbulent and politically unstable years. Colombia would continue to rely on outdated labor practices, mining, and agriculture to support itself. Peru relied on the nationalized monopolization of seabird guano to power through the mid-19th century, before going bankrupt by a railroad endeavor and conflicts with connected nations, before starting to rebuild. Brazil's population boomed as they increased infrastructure and trade by the value of rubber and coffee exports.

<<hr3Colombian independencehr3>>Colombians had been resisting Spanish rule throughout the past three centuries, but it would only be in the 19th century that the locals would be able to successfully push back and regain their lands. The [[Colombian War of Independence]] started after Colombia issued its Declaration of Independence on July 20, 1810, where they would continue to fight against the Spaniards until 1825. After the war, the economy of Colombia continued to rely on mining and agriculture, where there were a privileged few in the new nation. [[Coffee|coffee bean]] and [[tobacco]] became popular exports of Colombia by the end of the 19th century. Compared to other nearby nations, Colombia was lagging behind, continuing labor practices that kept the lower class down while continuing to support a small class of land-owning elites<<ref(content=link|https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2015/nr-4/colombias-bloody-history/(text=refCountref>> before modernizing in the early 20th century.

<<hr3Peruvian independencehr3>>Peru, like Colombia, rebelled against Spain throughout their reign over the nation. In 1809, the [[Peruvian War of Independence]] was kicked off by rebellions between northern and southern Peru caused by discrimination created by the mining industry. The Declaration of Independence of Peru would be signed on July 15, 1821, with the war concluding five years later. Political instability, corruption, and civil infighting would continue after Peru's independence until 1845. Afterward, Peru went through a period of political and economic stability with the rise of [[Ramón Castilla]].&pPeru's large coastline allowed for the natural accumulation of [[guano]] from [[seabirds|seabird]] within the region. Guano was discovered in Peru and put under the European spotlight at the turn of the 19th century, where it was investigated as being a potential [[fertilizer]]. Compared to guano generated in Europe, Peru's was of a much higher quality due to the favorable [[climate|Climate of Peru]]. In the 1840s, the government of Peru took advantage of its [[monopoly]] on guano, exporting it to Europe and North America as a fertilizer.<<ref(content=link|https://www.academia.edu/1788506/Influence_of_Seabird_guano_and_Camelid_dung_fertilization_on_the_nitrogen_isotopic_composition_of_field_grown_maize_Zea_mays_(text=refCountref>> As it was a nationalized market, it allowed for the paying off of [[debts|national debt]] and increasing [[education]] in the nation up to the 1860s. By then, many of the guano reserves had become depleted, with others dwindling, causing miners to turn to [[islands|island]] off the coasts of [[Africa]] for new guano exports. Wars with Spain and [[Ecuador]] had put Peru back into debt.&pThe [[American]] [[Henry Meiggs]], an entrepreneur from [[Boston]], was fleeing from [[San Francisco]] after committing [[forgery]] and [[fraud]] before his wrongdoings were discovered. After landing in [[Chile]], he made a fortune constructing railroads in the nation. He then turned toward Peru, which was susceptible to Meiggs' proposition of creating their own railroad network.<<ref(content=link|http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/meiggs.html(text=refCountref>> He quickly grew in influence over Peru, being considered a virtual [[dictator]] over the nation.<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20040606044839/http://www.jacobsarts.com/KieferBoytonPeru/Peru/grace.htm(text=refCountref>> However, the expense of the massive railroads had fully [[bankrupted|bankrupt]] Peru, creating an economic crisis in the nation. In 1879, Peru was then roped into the [[War of the Pacific]] with its ally [[Bolivia]] against Chile, in which Peru and Bolivia lost. This loss would actually contribute to a push to rebuild Peru, with social and economic changes created to aid the economy. This would lead to economic stability as seen in the 1840s going into the 1900s.

<<hr3Brazilian independencehr3>>The [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused the government of Portugal to flee to Brazil, greatly increasing the influence Brazil had over its colonizers. Trade was opened up with England with a favorably low [[{{iad valorem}} tax]] on British imports and an increase in manufacturing in 1810, with the drawback of losing their sugar and tobacco exports until 1844 to allow British dominance in the sugar and tobacco industry. This economic empowerment for Brazil helped lead to Brazil's independence in 1822. After independence, the population in Brazil dramatically grew throughout the rest of the century, with the GDP barely keeping pace with the new nation.&pCoffee continued to be the main export of Brazil, expanding throughout the 19th century. By the 1850s, it became the largest export of Brazil, especially benefiting from the autonomy granted by no longer being under colonial rule. The main constraints to the growth of coffee in Brazil were the transportation and the labor required for harvesting the crop. Railroads were started to be built in the 1860s to support the transportation needs created by the increased distance between coffee fields and the ports, while [[immigrant labor]] supplemented slavery while it was being abolished in the 1880s. This improved infrastructure allowed exports of [[cotton]], [[cocoa|cocoa bean]], and tobacco. The infrastructure continued to improve because of a boom in [[rubber]] demands, further boosting the Brazilian economy.

<<hr21900s through the World Warshr2>>The span between 1900 and 1945 saw increased industrialization and globalization throughout the Northern South American region. The United States capitalized on the reliance on exports from these nations to grow a closer bond to their southern neighbors. Colombia saw the expansion of transportation and communication infrastructure while being provided with machinery and aid from the US. Peru stuck closer to agriculture, also being nudged by the US for exports. Brazil's financial policy mirrored those of other fascist nations, pushing forth industrialization and corporatism while crushing the working class.

<<hr3Colombia and the UShr3>>Going into the 1900s, Colombia saw an increase in modernization as coffee exports increased in the country. Railroads and improved communications were set up, following Brazil's tactic of expansion when booming with coffee, to ride on the success. This boom also expanded the wealth of the working class, as after the [[Thousand Days' War]], large plantation owners had to partition their plantations among their workers, who made massive profits as coffee continued to soar.<<ref(content=link|https://www.nescafe.com/in/colombian-coffee(text=refCountref>>&pColombia remained neutral during WWI, facing little to no effect from the global conflict, but was given more attention by the [[United States]].<<ref(content=link|https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA586356756&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=15572021&ampp=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=mlin_oweb&isGeoAuthType=true&aty=geo(text=refCountref>> Colombia had also weathered the [[Great Depression]], shifting away from the collapsing coffee industry to exporting [[raw materials|raw material]]. Colombia took a more active role in WWII, allowing the US to station troops within the nation while aiding in naval operations. As European and Asian markets cut out Colombia, they increasingly relied on US trade for machinery and steel. The US also grew interest in the [[platinum]] mining operations in Colombia, a metal the [[Axis powers]] were in low supply of during the war, causing the US to buy up their entire supply while providing technical aid to increase production from Colombia to be exported to the US. The US had also been vital in keeping Colombia's [[banana]] and coffee industries afloat during the war.

<<hr3Coup in Peruhr3>>Peru entering the 20th century saw continued economic growth with their exports of [[cotton]], sugar, and metals from mining from their rebuilding. However, WWI's disruption of the global market had harmed the economy of Peru, which almost exclusively relied on foreign exports beforehand. Following, former President [[Augusto Leguía|Augusto B. Leguía]] staged a [[coup]], succeeding, which led to changes being made to economic policy in the early 1920s. The government under Leguía had continued to accrue national debt, boiling over in the early 1930s after Leguía was overthrown, leading to Peru being ostracized from foreign markets.<<ref(content=link|https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/pe/pe_full.html(text=refCountref>> During the Second World War, the US also started receiving exports from Peru, mainly in cotton. Peru's policy on price controls backfired on Peru as they received less economic benefits from the war compared to their neighbors.

<<hr3Industrialization, fascism, and Brazilhr3>>Brazil's export economy's strength persisted to WWI, despite their active involvement against the [[Germans|Germany]] and the [[Central Powers|Central Powers in World War I]]. Their involvement in the war allowed Brazil to profit from the increased demand for [[foodstuffs]] and raw materials. This would be the first indication of Brazil's trend away from an agricultural economy and towards an industrial one. The Great Depression in 1928 hit hard on Brazil, cutting their coffee exports in half and nearly killing all foreign investments in the country.&pBrazil, shortly after the Depression, would see the rise of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]], as the government pushed increasingly [[communist]] and [[fascist]] influences into their economic policy. These new policies focused on increasing the power of [[corporations|corporation]] in the name of an improved industrial sector while also trying to weaken the [[working class]]. Investment had increased again, rebounding from the crash during the Depression. Brazil surprisingly sided with the [[Allies|Allies of World War II]] during WWII, contrary to the [[Axis|Axis powers]]-inspired fascist regime in the nation at the time. The US gave financial incentives to Brazil early in the war, tying it close to the US throughout. During the war, the GDP in Brazil drastically grew alongside the industrial sector.<<ref(content=link|https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-6/economic-crisis/(text=refCountref>>

<<hr2Post-World Warshr2>>After the World Wars, countries in Northern South America primarily focused on decreasing their reliance on foreign nations for imports. Inflation was a reoccurring problem for some, as these nations were still developing their economy after the wars. Reforms were common during this period as nations attempted to find the right balance of government control and decentralization to allow their markets to soar. Going into the 21st century, this region held onto its economic roots, relying on the favorable climate to grow crops native to the region alongside others that also thrive in the unique conditions. Mining has also been an industry continuously carved out as mining equipment and practices modernized, increasing their ability to extract resources including gold, iron, and coal. This region also experienced large economic growth as they became more interconnected with the wider, world, including Peru's GDP increasing fivefold and Brazil having the 10th largest GDP in the world.

<<hr3Colombia's stabilityhr3>>Following the wars, Colombia focused on increasing their domestic sector, replacing imports with their own produced goods. Coffee production continued to soar in Colombia as more land was allocated for production while policies on [[banks|bank]] were set into place to curb inflation. The economy kept stable throughout the 1980s, with no major spikes in growth or dips into recessions. In the 1990s, decentralization became a goal of the new administration, removing government interference and increasing free trade. The [[private sector]] grew as [[oil production]] became a staple of the Colombian economy, further connecting Colombia to the foreign market.&pLeading into the 21st century, Colombia had a new [[flower]] market emerge, quickly growing to become a major contributor to Colombia's market. Colombia has since become the 2nd largest producer of cut flowers in 2021.<<ref(content=link|https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2021/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/060310(text=refCountref>> Throughout the century, Colombia sustained a calm rate of growth from its agricultural sector. Coffee remains one of its largest agricultural exports, with sugarcane and cocoa closely behind. The industrial sector also continued to expand, following its post-war domestication of products. Colombia continues its mining production for [[oil]], [[coal]],  [[emeralds|emeralds]], and other valuable minerals. Today, Colombia's economy is set to be stable through its agriculture, industrial, and mining sectors that dominate the nation.<<ref(content=link|https://www.moon.com/travel/trip-ideas/colombias-economy/(text=refCountref>>

<<hr3Peru's reboundhr3>>Peru faced another military coup after the war from General [[Manuel A. Odría]], who took power in 1948. His dictatorship directly influenced the economic policy, exploiting the remaining wealth following the wars. New policies were focused on coastal nations, growing the economy at the cost of impoverishment of those in the interior of Peru.<<ref(content=link|https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/lo/countries/pe/pe_full.html(text=refCountref>> After the fall of Odría, [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] took power through a following [[coup|1968 Peruvian coup d'état]], establishing [[state capitalism]] amidst a period of economic growth. Land reform under Velasco replaced the former [[serfdom]]-derived system for one of the [[agricultural cooperatives|agricultural cooperative]]. Coups, conflicts, and internal struggles continued to shake and stagnate the Peruvian economy for the next three decades.&pIt is only leading through to the 21st century when Peru starts to regain economic growth. It saw a similar policy change to Colombia toward decentralization of businesses and industries, decreasing governmental interference. This shift encouraged foreign investment as more effort was pushed toward privatization. Agriculture remains strong in Peru, producing [[avocados|avocado]], [[blueberries|blueberry]], [[cocoa]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]], [[bananas|banana]], and other [[tropical crops|Crops in Latin America]]. Peru also has a large stake in mining, where [[gold]], [[silver]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[coal]] are harvested. Between 2000 and 2022, the GDP of Peru increased nearly fivefold,<<ref(content=link|https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/April/weo-report?c=293,&s=NGDPD,&sy=2000&ey=2022&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1(text=refCountref>> representing the trend of expansion and accrual of wealth present in the nation today.

Long-lasting goods, such as [[trucks|truck]], became more prominent during this period as consumerism rose during the period. Following stagnation in the mid-1960s, Brazil saw a boom in economic growth. Exports grew from 31% between 1960 and 1962 up to 42.7% in 1972, showing an upward trend during this time.<<ref(content=link|https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.brazilcountrystu00huds_0/?sp=272&st=image(text=refCountref>> Modernization became prominent during this growth, boosting the economy as Brazil continued to diversify its industry.&pAfter the period of prosperity, the economy's growth started to slow, turning around into a deficit and [[inflation|economic inflation]]. The dips and instability in the price of oil aided in the downturn and inflation faced by Brazil. Brazil's close ties to the US would backfire when banks in 1981 cut their credit lines to Brazil causing Brazil to slip into [[hyperinflation]].<<ref(content=link|https://web.archive.org/web/20170805061126/http://brazil.melhores.com.br/chapter2.html(text=refCountref>> It would take government action in the second half of the 1980s to control inflation, most notably with the [[Cruzado Plan]] in 1986. A following hyperinflation spike would occur in the early 1990s.&pBrazil in the 21st century saw a rise in its economy as it became more modernized within the 2000s. Their agricultural sector is still quite predominant, covering sugarcane, coffee, [[soy|soybean]], and [[oranges|orange (fruit)]] as their staple crops. Brazil's mining stake covers gold, iron, copper, [[aluminum]], and other various gemstones and metals. Brazil also boasts a diverse industrial sector, covering [[aircraft]], [[automobiles|automobile]], [[computers|computer]], and [[steel]] products. Brazil has the 10th highest GDP of 2 billion USD in early 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/top-10-largest-economies-in-the-world/86159/1(text=refCountref>>

<<hrComparisonshr>>Despite their geographic distance and historical background, Western Europe and Northern South America share parallels in the evolution of their economies. Both regions had heavy influence through colonialism, with one bolstering their economy through the practice, and the other subjected and pressed through the practice. They had also experienced industrial growth, with Western Europe being the starting location for the Industrial Revolution as Northern South America adopted it to push forth their agricultural industry. The World Wars had an imbalanced impact on the regions, with Northern South America benefiting from their trade with the US while Western Europe was at the forefront of the wars. To the [[present]], Northern South America's economy is still undergoing development as they continue to industrialize and rely on their [[natural resources|natural resource]] while Western Europe continues to stay ahead in economic development as they both participate in the global economy.

<<hr2Colonialismhr2>>Western European colonies were bolstered through colonialism, pushing through the New World to benefit from the newly discovered crops, rare metals, and unique climates that aided in agriculture. England was a major proponent of colonialism, launching the East India Company and colonizing North America, which profited from tobacco, rice, and cotton from their colonies. France also attempted to join in on colonialism, with less success through their French East India Company and their involvement within North America and Brazil. From the 1500s and three centuries thereafter, Northern South America was defined by colonialism, not as a source of income, but as a tool of [[oppression]]. The primary benefactors of exports from the region were the colonizers and not the inhabitants. They also produced rare metals and gemstones, crops including sugarcane and tobacco, and {{ipau-brasil}}. Northern South America, unlike Western Europe, did not experience the same economic advantages, instead being shaped through exploitation and subjugation.

<<hr2Industrializationhr2>>Both regions experienced industrial booms, albeit at different times. Western Europe was the [[first]] to experience industrialization, especially England, the birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 1760s. France, despite lagging behind because of the [[French Revolution]], would also see industrialization in the 1850s. [[Railroads|railroad]] would become prominent during this industrial period as factory jobs would span across Western Europe. Northern South America would continue to stick closely to their agricultural exports in the 19th century and halfway through the 20th. Brazil and Peru both attempted to utilize railroads to expand the size of their agricultural empires in their respective nations. While Peru's attempt ended in bankruptcy for the nation, Brazil's railroad system bolstered the economy while cotton, cocoa, tobacco, rubber, and especially coffee exports skyrocketed. While Western Europe saw a period of deindustrialization after the World Wars, instead focusing on the modern service sectors to expand their economies into the [[Information Age]], Northern South America saw industrialization grow as their political and economic situations stabilized.

<<hr2World Warshr2>>While the World Wars had directly impacted Western Europe's economy (with the primary [[theaters|theater (warfare)]] taking place in the region), Northern South America saw less drastic effects. England's economy had a stable, yet slow growth throughout the wars, taking out loans from the United States to create [[munitions|muntion]] for the war effort, while France (a major target of [[Germany]] in both wars) was directly devastated with infrastructure destroyed and millions of people lost. Colombia, Peru, and Brazil would all create closer bonds with the US throughout WWII, with Colombia and Brazil continuing to see economic growth through the period.

<<hr2Modern economieshr2>>In the modern economy, Western Europe and Northern South America have undergone globalization as their economies, imports and exports, are influenced by all the nations in the world. [[International trade]], [[foreign investments|foreign investment]], and the [[global supply chain]] all have a direct impact on these regions. They also are influenced by the diversification of their economies, increasing economic security and expanding their economies overall. While Western Europe primarily focuses on growing its service sector, Northern South America varies its agriculture, industrial production, and [[tourism]] to diversify. While the economy and infrastructure in Western Europe are highly advanced with the benefit of earlier industrialization and increased wealth, Northern South America is still catching up. Brazil is the most successful in the region to do so, having the 10th highest [[GDP|global domestic product]] in early 2024.<<ref(content=link|https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/top-10-largest-economies-in-the-world/86159/1(text=refCountref>>`,

They often give effects that last for long periods of time, if not the rest of the game.<<hrRuleshr>><<AsofOctober 2023>>, under the [[Comprehensive Rules]], there is a section dedicated to enchantment cards.&p{{b303.}} Enchantments&sp&tab{{b303.1.}} A [[player|player (Magic: the Gathering)]] who has [[priority|priority (magic: the gathering)]] may [[cast|casting (Magic: the gathering)]] an enchantment card from their [[hand|hand (magic: the gathering)]] during a [[main phase|main phase (Magic: the gathering)]] of their [[turn|turn (magic: the gathering)]] when the [[stack|stack (Magic: the gathering)]] is [[empty]]. Casting an enchantment as a [[spell|spell (magic: the gathering)]] uses the stack. (See role 601, "Casting Spells.")&sp&tab{{b303.2.}} When an enchantment spell resolves, its [[controller|controller (Magic: the Gathering)]] puts it onto the [[battlefield|battlefield (magic: the gathering)]] under their control.&sp&tab{{b303.3.}} Enchantment [[subtypes|subtype (Magic: the gathering)]] are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: "Enchantment --- [[Shrine|Shrine (Magic: the Gathering)]]." Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment types. Enchantments may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3h for the complete list of enchantment types.&sp&tab{{b303.4.}} Some enchantments have the subtype "[[Aura|Aura (Magic: the Gathering)]]." An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an [[object|object (Magic: the Gathering)]] or player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5 "Enchant"). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4a}} An Aura spell requires a target, which is defined by an enchant ability.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4b}} The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted. The aura is attached to, or "enchants", that object or player.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4c}} If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player as defined by its enchant ability and other applicable effects, the object it was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has left the game, the Aura is put into its owner's [[graveyard|graveyard (magic: the gathering)]]. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4d}} An Aura can't enchant itself. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its owner's graveyard. An Aura that's also a [[creature|creature (Magic: the Gathering)]] can't enchant anything. If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached, then is put into its owner's graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.) An Aura can't enchant more than one object or player. If a spell or ability would cause an Aura to become attached to more than one object or player, the Aura's controller chooses which object or player it becomes attached to.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4e}} An Aura's controller is separate from the enchanted object's controller or the enchanted player; the two need not be the same. If an Aura enchants an object, changing control of the object doesn't change control of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Aura's controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Aura grants an ability to the enchanted object (with "gains" or "has"), the enchanted object's controller is the only one who can activate that ability.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4f}} If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a player's control by any means other than by resolving as an Aura spell, and the effect putting it onto the battlefield doesn't specify the object or player the Aura will enchant, the player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the battlefield. The player must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura's enchant ability and any other applicable effects.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4g}} If an Aura is entering the battlefield and there is no legal object or player for it to enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is in the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into the owner's graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn't created.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4h}} If an effect attempts to put a permanent that isn't an Aura, [[Equipment|Equipment (Magic: the Gathering)]], or [[Fortification|Fortification (Magic: the Gathering)]] onto the battle attached to an object or player, it enters the battlefield unattached.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4i}} If an effect attempts to put an Aura onto the battlefield attached to either an object or player that is undefined, the Aura remains in its current zone., unless that zone is in the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into the owner's graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn't created.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4j}} If an effect attempts to attach an Aura onto the battlefield to an object or player it can't legally enchant, the Aura doesn't move.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4k}} If an effect allows an Aura that's being turned face up to become attached to an object or player, the Aura's controller considers the characteristics of that Aura as it would exist if it were face up to determine what it may be attached to, and they must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura's enchant ability and any other applicable effects.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4m}} An ability of a permanent that refers to the "enchanted [object or player]" refers to whatever object or player that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn't an Aura.&sp&tab{{b303.5.}} Some enchantments have the subtype "[[Saga|Saga (Magic: the Gathering)]]." See rule 714 for more information about Saga cards.&sp&tab{{b303.6.}} Some enchantments have the subtype "[[Class|Class (Magic: the Gathering)]]." See rule 716 for more information about Class cards.&sp&tab{{b303.7.}} Some Aura enchantments also have the subtype "[[Role|Role (Magic: the Gathering)]]."&sp&tab&tab{{b303.7a}} If a permanent has more than one Role controlled by the same player attached to it, each of those Roles except the one with the most recent timestamp is put into its owner's graveyard. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.`,

You can also pay the cost to swap the current creature that has the equipment.<<hrRuleshr>><<AsofOctober 2023>>, under the [[Comprehensive Rules|Comprehensive Rules (Magic: the Gathering)]], there is a subsection and separate rule for equipment.&sp&tab{{b303.4.}} Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It can’t legally be attached to anything that isn’t a creature.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4a}} The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the “equipped creature.” The Equipment is attached to, or “equips,” that creature.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4b}} Equipment spells are cast like other artifact spells. Equipment enter the [[battlefield|battlefield (Magic: the Gathering)]] like other artifacts. They don’t enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature you control (see rule 702.6, “Equip”). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that can’t be equipped by it, the Equipment doesn’t move.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4c}} An Equipment that’s also a creature can’t equip a creature unless that Equipment has [[reconfigure|reconfigure (Magic: the Gathering)]] (see rule 702.151, “Reconfigure”). An Equipment that loses the subtype “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.) An Equipment can’t equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipment’s [[controller|controller (magic: the gathering)]] chooses which creature it equips.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4d}} An Equipment’s controller is separate from the equipped creature’s controller; the two need not be the same. Changing control of the creature doesn’t change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the Equipment’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped creature (with “gains” or “has”), the equipped creature’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4e}} If an effect attempts to put an Equipment that isn’t also an [[Aura|Aura (magic: the gathering)]] (see rule 303.4i) onto the battlefield attached to either an object it can’t legally equip or an object that is undefined, the Equipment enters the battlefield unattached. If the Equipment is a token, it’s created and enters the battlefield unattached.&sp&tab&tab{{b303.4f}} An ability of a permanent that refers to the “equipped creature” refers to whatever creature that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Equipment.&sp&tab{{b604.4.}} Many Auras, Equipment, and [[Fortifications|Fortification (Magic: the Gathering)]] have static abilities that modify the object they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.`,

Most had read earlier works by the author and expected/hoped for more content in this brief book. I get that... But as a spring board to healthful eating concepts, given to 'fast foodie' loved ones(and we all have them)this book is a gem. I have studied healthy diet, nutrition and cooking techniques for many years. I found this book an easily digestible overview and reminder of much valuable information, that can be given as a caring non-offensive gift to loved ones and friends. Why do I use the word non-offensive? Because people embrace, guard, defend and protect their habituated food practices as fiercely as any other habitual substance. Food Rules presents simple stripped down truths regarding having a healthy relationship with food. That's it - that's all. I am gifting this book to many of my friends and loved ones -why? Because, being unsolicited, it is a short read that they may actually read through, and one that could turn out to be the impetus for change in their relationships with food. Face it - we all have loved ones and friends who are sick, obese, addicted to poor eating habits and toxic food choices. Many who are responsible for the eating habits of future generations. They may think of you as a 'health nut' and look for a quick exit when the topic of health and diet surfaces in conversation. Okay - so gift them with this book. If you are reading this you obviously value healthy eating - pay it forward and who knows...it may be the spring board of consciousness that gives your loved one a toe hold on changing this most important life factor.&p⭐⭐⭐ - C. B. St Hilaire, United States on May 8, 2010&sp{{ba very basic guide to cure the American diet woes}}&spI do think this would cure America, but I also think that this book was so/so. Don't get me wrong - I think that Michael Pollan is wonderful and I'm so grateful that he exists as a writer and researcher. However, if you are a healthy eater at all or have any concern for what goes into your body (and what shouldn't), then you know what is in here already. And I'm guessing that most people that even look at this Amazon record already have put a lot of thought into their diet. It took me 20 minutes to read this book. It is simply little clips and short rules to adhere to: don't eat something that is pink and in a tube--GoGurt--eat real food instead; stay away from overprocessed stuff; stop eating before you are full; eat mostly plants; etc. I am a vegetarian and very aware of what I'm eating, so I am probably more critical than the masses who think that fast food is still an OK thing to eat.&pI gave this a 3 because I don't think it is a bad thing to refer to from time to time. I also think it is good to pass it to someone you just know doesn't eat their veggies and thinks that they can drink soda all day long.&pHowever, if you already understand the basic realities of how to eat healthy in this overprocessed world, then you can save your $5 and buy another one of Pollan's books instead.`,

When the server opened, it was repeatedly crashing and going down. When the server stabilized, a fistfight occurred at spawn, including Franzy and Cahd, who attacked [[Battosay]]. Battosay, a moderator for the {{iBetter Than Wolves}} Discord server and Transient, [[banned|ban (Minecraft)]] Franzy and Cahd from the server. Warm, Lon, and Shadda would venture out to survive. Igorex would later become un-whitelisted from the server. After the first few nights, the idea of a separate server was created.<<hr2Pre-serverhr2>>Franzy would create the Discord server for Franzient the same day as the opening of Season 6, adding Cahd, Igorex, Warm_Wooly, Lonmower, ChrisMC127, and ITL Supress. To start, the originating members of Franzient started [[seed hunting|seed hunting (Minecraft)]] for a good seed for the first season of Franzient. Multiple seeds, including {{code-6179774138385506497}}, {{code-9057352651117540831}}, {{codeTransient fell off}}, {{codeBetter than omega smp}}, and {{codeFranzyient is goog}} would be tested, with {{codeFRANZY}} being selected because of its nearby proximity to a [[Desert Temple|Desert Temple (Better Than Wolves)]], [[Villages|Village (Better Than Wolves)]], and a [[Mineshaft|Mineshaft (Better Than Wolves)]] with [[Melon Seeds|Melon Seeds (Better Than Wolves)]]. The server would open the following day with a plan set in place to survive the first nights.<<hrSeason 0hr>>Season 0 of Franzient, a test run for a server separate from Transient, ran on {{i[[Better Than Wolves 3.0.0a Beta]]}} ([[{{iMinecraft}} 1.6.4|Minecraft: Java Edition 1.6.4]]), the latest beta release for {{iBetter Than Wolves}} when the server was started (September 29, 2024). The IP for the server was {{codefranzient.itlesports.com}}. The server was closed on November 20, 2024, after lasting for 53 days. The server was closed due to inactivity after completing the full SFS beacon three weeks prior.<<hr2First dayhr2>>Upon starting the server, [[Shafts|Shaft (Better Than Wolves)]] and [[Sharp Stones|Sharp Stone (Better Than Wolves)]] were swiftly collected, with Igorex and Franzy focusing on looting the Desert Temple and Warm collecting food and building a hole for the night. During the looting of the Desert Temple, a [[Pile of Sand|Pile of Sand (Better Than Wolves)]] fell on the [[Pressure Plate|Wooden Pressure Plate (Better Than Wolves)]], destroying the [[Powder Kegs|Powder Keg (Better Than Wolves)]] and [[Hampers|Hamper (Better Than Wolves)]]. Warm, Franzy, and Igorex held out the night in the base, with Warm becoming the "cook" of the group as they ate the no-longer-local wildlife that was harvested. When day broke again, the group continued forth to collect food and resources to prepare for a [[Brick Oven|Brick Oven (Better Than Wolves)]].<<hr2Notable references/eventshr2>><<hr3Memes/phraseshr3>>A common phrase at the start of the server was "Transient is [[skibidi]] while Franzient is [[hawk tuah]]". The [[meme|internet meme]] hawk tuah would continue to be prominent amongst server members, along with references to {{i[[Among Us]]}}, {{i[[Parkour Civilization]]}}, and "Chris cow pen".<<hr3Chris cow penhr3>><<vid(src=git/franzient s0 cow pen (1).mp4(cap=A [[We all have a great story to tell]] meme based on Chris' cow pen.<<note(content=The state of the cow pen used in the meme was after the second wave of chunk corruptions.(text=noteCountnote>>vid>>The server had progressed to a [[Crucible|Crucible (Better Than Wolves)]] when animals started to get wrangled to the base to harvest food and other resources. After a pair of [[Sheep|sheep (Better Than Wolves)]] were brought over to the base, Franzy ventured out to collect [[Cows|Cow (Better Than Wolves)]] and tasked ChrisMC127 (shortened to Chris) with constructing a pen to house the Cows on October 2, 2024. Chris started creating a large wall out of [[Cobbled Blackstone|Cobbled Blackstone (Better Than Wolves)]] that formed with the terrain, with no set shape, size, or wall height. When Franzy returned to the base with a pair of Cows, he became outraged when he saw the sorry, unfinished state of the pen. Chris would repeatedly place blocks, causing the Cows to panic and kick Franzy as the [[Sun|Sun (Minecraft)]] started to set. Warm aided in adding lighting through [[Blocks of Redstone|Block of Redstone (Better Than Wolves)]] and patched up several holes and openings in the pen. A [[Creeper|Creeper (Better Than Wolves)]] then blew a hole in the wall the same night, requiring it to be patched. Fortunately, both the Cows survived the endeavor.&pOn October 26th, one of the Cows was killed, leaving only one remaining in the pen. It is unknown how the Cow was killed.<<hr3ITL as godhr3>><<img(src=git/franzient s0 temple.png(cap=The temple where the [[Nether Portal|Nether Portal (Better Than Wolves)]] was situated.img>>ITL Supress, the host of the server, acted as a "god" for the server, flying around in [[Creative Mode|Creative Mode (Minecraft)]] and creating large structures. ITL was mostly passive when it came to player affairs, and he was not seen abusing his power to an absurd degree. ITL created two structures, each with a different purpose. The first structure was a large temple made out of [[Stone Bricks|Stone Brick (Better Than Wolves)]] that held a Nether Portal. Franzy symbolically destroyed 10 [[Obsidian|Obsidian (Better Than Wolves),]] to pay for "access" to the portal held within. The temple was also used to host Franzy's [[birthday]]. Chests full of gear, materials to build a [[Wither|Wither (Better Than Wolves)]], and other valuable items and blocks were inside, but they were later destroyed as they were seen as going too far. A second structure made out of [[Quartz Blocks|Quartz Block (Better Than Wolves)]] was also created, acting as a pseudo-[[mob farm|mob farm (Better Than Wolves)]]. This was never used and was removed after the structure got broken up through the second wave of chunk corruption.<<hr3Chunk corruptionhr3>><<img(src=git/franzient s0 chunks.png(cap=Misplaced chunks changing biomes and jutting upward.img>>ITL's server was prone to [[crashing|server crash]] or going offline. Two of these crashes caused [[chunk corruption|chunk corruption (Minecraft)]]. The first one on October 5th caused minor displacement of chunks, with little repercussions caused by the relatively few structures built around the base. The second wave of chunk corruption on October 10th caused more relative damage. The ladder to the [[Squid Farm|Squid Farm (Better Than Wolves)]] and the staircase to the End Portal were removed. The [[Cauldron|Cauldron (Better Than Wolves)]] and [[Wolves|Wolf (Better Than Wolves)]] connected to the base were relocated, disturbing the [[Melon|Melon (Better Than Wolves)]] farm. The pseudo-mob farm was separated into three different chunks before being torn down. The nearby [[Village|Village (Better Than Wolves)]] also had buildings misplaced, but none of the [[Villagers|Villager (Better Than Wolves)]] went missing. Chris' cow pen had to be quickly patched up again as a portion of the wall was misplaced. Paths and other minor structures were repaired throughout the rest of the day.<<hr3Wither fightshr3>><<img(src=git/franzient s0 wither.png(cap=Franzy, Igorex, Chris, and Warm posing after the first Wither fight.img>>The first [[Wither|Wither (Better Than Wolves)]] was fought by Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and Chris on October 9, 2024. The Wither fight took place in [[3rd strata|Strata (Better Than Wolves)]] in a location roughly 1000 [[blocks|Block (Minecraft unit)]] away from the base connected via the [[Nether|Nether (Better Than Wolves)]]. The room was then carved out to support the Wither, with several small interconnected tunnels to allow players to safely weave and travel in case of danger. Franzy and Warm came equipped mostly with diamond armor, with Chris and Igorex mostly wearing leather and padded armor respectively. All four players came equipped with [[Diamond Swords|Diamond Sword (Better Than Wolves)]] and [[Picks|Diamond Pickaxe (Better Than Wolves)]], [[Potions of Healing|Potion of Healing (Better Than Wolves)]], and [[Compound Bows|Compound Bow (Better Than Wolves)]] and [[Arrows|Arrow (Better Than Wolves)]] to take pot shots at the Wither. After the Wither was constructed, the players all ran into separate tunnels to avoid hitting others in the crossfire. The bombardment of arrows quickly chipped away at the Wither's health, bringing it to its second phase. The players then rushed the Wither with swords, splashing potions close to others to maximize the healing. The Wither was then defeated, and Igorex collected the [[Nether Star|Nether Star (Better Than Wolves)]], and it dropped. The Nether Star was then used to turn a [[Dormant Soulforge|Dormant Soulforge (Better Than Wolves)]] into a [[Soulforge|Soulforge (Better Than Wolves)]].&pFranzy would complete a second Wither fight on October 20, 2024, in full diamond armor to obtain the second Nether Star required for a [[Beacon|Beacon (Better Than Wolves)]]. Franzy was streaming the Wither fight, getting coached by [[Battosay]] throughout.<<hr3Ender Dragon fighthr3>><<img(src=git/franzient s0 ender dragon.png(cap=Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and a statue of "Chris" posing after the Ender Dragon fight.img>>The [[Ender Dragon|Ender Dragon (Better Than Wolves)]] was fought by Franzy, Igorex, Warm, and Chris on October 13, 2024. Franzy, Igorex, and Warm came equipped with full diamond (mostly full for Igorex), while Chris came in with chainmail. All players had [[Snowballs|Snowball (Better Than Wolves)]], Diamond Swords and Picks, Potions of Healing, and [[Water Buckets|Water Bucket (Better Than Wolves)]]. Igorex and Warm came with Compound Bows and Arrows, while Franzy had a [[Bow|Bow (Better Than Wolves)]] and [[Rotted Arrows|Rotted Arrow (Better Than Wolves)]]. All players hopped into the [[End Portal|End Portal (Minecraft)]] at the same time and dug out a staircase to the surface. Chris, Igorex, and Franzy collected [[End Stone|End Stone (Better Than Wolves)]] to process after the battle. The group created large bodies of [[Water|Water (Better Than Wolves)]] to protect themselves from [[Endermen|Enderman (Better Than Wolves)]] and from being launched by the Ender Dragon, using Snowballs and Arrows to take out the [[End Crystals|End Crystal (Better Than Wolves)]] on the pillars around the island. After the End Crystals were dealt with, the players grouped up and shot at the Ender Dragon as it swooped down. Chris died during one of the swoops, effectively kept out of the rest of the fight. Igorex had also been injured several times throughout the fight by the Ender Dragon's constant bombardment. The Ender Dragon was finally slain, with Franzy collecting the [[Dragon Egg|Dragon Egg (Better Than Wolves)]] before the remaining players returned to the [[Overworld|Overworld (Better Than Wolves)]].<<hr3{{iBetter Than Tuah}}hr3>>{{iBetter Than Tuah}} was a fictional [[podcast]] between Franzy, Warm_Wooly, Battosay, and "guest" Wdbittle on October 26th. The name was a play on {{iBetter Than Wolves}} and {{i[[Talk Tuah with Haliey Welch]]}}. The location was a 4x4 [[White Stone Table|White Stone Table (Better Than Wolves)]] with a 2x2 [[Netherrack|Netherrack (Better Than Wolves)]] firepit embedded inside, with a 6x6 ring of [[White Stone Benches|White Stone Bench (Better Than Wolves)]] to stand on next to the base. During the period, discussions regarding [[chocolate within the United States]], the number of [[ingredients|ingredient]] within [[ketchup]] based on [[country]], the [[2024 United States presidential election]], [[voter registration in Indiana]], [[Conservative media in the United States]] including [[Fox News]], [[learning English through popular media]], and Wdbittle's [[Newgrounds]] favorited art history were conducted. Wdbittle was killed multiple times by Franzy for tossing [[items|item (Minecraft)]] into the firepit, including [[Sawdust|Sawdust (Better Than Wolves)]], [[Loose Stones|Loose Stone (Better Than Wolves)]], and [[Loose Cobblestone Slabs|Loose Cobblestone Slab (Better Than Wolves)]], with Warm teleporting Wdbittle back. The podcast ended when Battosay's connection to the Discord call impeded talking and listening at the same time.<<hr3SFS grindhr3>><<img(src=git/franzient s0 auto kiln.png(cap=Igorex's auto Kiln next to his mass Mill Stone.img>>After the Ender Dragon was defeated, the server was immediately geared towards creating [[Soulforged Steel|Soulforged Steel (Better Than Wolves)]] to create a full SFS beacon to set spawn.

Attack cards deal [[damage|damage (Hexaria)]] to a target, which can have a range, [[AOE|Area of Effect (Hexaria)]], additional effects, or bonuses based on the situation. Healing cards increase [[health|health (Hexaria)]] or apply regenerative [[effects|effect (Hexaria)]] onto a target (including self), often with stipulations, range, and/or an AOE. Effect cards are the broadest category, applying status effects, [[summoning|summon card (Hexaria)]] allies, drawing and redrawing cards, gaining [[Bits|Bit (Hexaria)]], and other effects. Buff cards apply [[attack|attack buff (Hexaria)]] and [[defense buffs|defense buff (Hexaria)]] or [[attack|attack debuff (Hexaria)]] and [[defense debuffs|defense debuff (Hexaria)]] to targets alongside other attack/defense-related effects. Lastly, trap cards place an object onto the field that triggers when an enemy stands on or walks over it, often dealing damage, applying a negative effect, or even summoning allies. Field cards apply an effect to the entire battlefield over a duration. Cards also come in 4 [[rarities|card rarity (Hexaria)]]: common (grey border), rare (white border), ultra-rare (yellow border), and legendary (cyan border). Rarities determine how many copies of a card can be in a deck (including reskins), starting at 4 copies for commons down to 1 copy for legendaries.

At the start of a turn, a player/entity gains a Bit, with various effects increasing/decreasing earned and max Bits, which are used to play most cards. Standard players and entities can move up to 2 tiles away and play a card. Some cards are [[quickplay|quickplay (Hexaria)]], which means they can be played mid-turn without ending it. Every turn for players lasts 30 seconds in most cases, where if a player hasn't selected an option, they will automatically skip their turn. At the end of a turn, all damage/healing effects trigger. Traps triggered will immediately deal damage/effects mid-turn. A battle ends when all players die (not including summoned allies) or when all enemies die. A battle can have up to 4 players in most cases, with enemies/allies only limited by the size of the battle area.`,

These all have the term 'log' in some position of the name. It will first display all pages that start with the prompt, then those that include the prompt, and then any redirects. They will also attempt to find pages using the short text, which can be enabled and disabled in the [[settings]]. Hitting [[enter|enter key]] will select the top page based on the prompt, and clicking on the name will send you to the page selected.&pIf the exact name for a page has not been made yet, an option labeled "Make page for xyz" will be shown, which can be clicked to go and make a new page with the given prompt.

This will open the editing interface at the bottom of the page. Details for editing, such as the guidelines, syntax, and other information can be found at [[How to make/edit pages]].<<hr2Image expansionhr2>>Whe left clicked or tapped on mobile, an image will be fully expanded to fit the size of a page. To undo this, click or tap on the image again. Changing the brightness of images will not affect the expanded image. The main use is to allow you to display images or get more detail from the image. You can also do other normal image actions such as saving and downloading the image when expanded.<<hr2Image popupshr2>>{{tMain page: [[Image popup (Anotherpedia)]]}}&spAn image popup is a popup of an image which can be created by right-clicking it. This action can be performed on mobile, but it will only create a new tab with the image. The image can be manipulated, such as changing the size, shape, rotation, and location, when in the form of a popup.<<hr2Opening new tabshr2>>This does not relate to the normal function on [[browsers|browser]] where users can right-click to open up a menu. Anotherpedia allows users to quickly open new tabs for pages by right-clicking or holding down on mobile on Settings, Random Page, and in the search bar. For example, searching up "Log" and right-clicking the option for [[Logo]] will create a new tab with the page logo. The primary use is to allow users to quickly search or go to thier settings without leaving their current page.`,

The meme originated from a video titled "5 Minute Crafts That Will Ruin Your Day!" posted on January 22, 2021, where Imbrandonfarris attempts to "follow" various [[5-minute crafts|5-minute craft]] from the YouTube channel [[5-Minute Crafts|5-Minute Crafts (YouTube channel)]] to a comedic degree.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tkTxUrsrLA(text=refCountref>><<hrBreakdownhr>>A clip of a girl sitting on a [[desk chair]] popping a [[balloon]] from 5-Minute Crafts plays, propelling herself backward with a caption stating "IT WORKS!". Imbrandonfarris, sitting in a desk chair in his kitchen, pops a balloon and remains motionless. He then tries a [[glitter popper]] and a [[confetti popper]] to no avail. That's when Imbrandonfarris shakes a 5-gallon jug before placing it up against a [[fridge|refrigerator]] saying "Go big or go home." The foam expands, popping the cap off the jug and propelling Imbrandonfarris slightly backward. He stands from his chair and slips on the foam covering the ground while trying to cover the jug. He manages to prop himself upright and says "Stop it" while he forces the jug closed. A moment later, the jug erupts again before halting. Imbrandonfarris uses a [[rag|dish rag]] to wipe foam stuck to the fridge and then reaches for a hand made of [[soap]], asking it "Are you ok?" The scene ends with Imbrandonfarris pointing backward while commenting "Hey, it [the foam] reached the stove."`,

The creation of the M79 was the result of [[Project NIBLICK]] from the [[US Army|United States Army]] to develop a modern grenade launcher.

For close-range encounters, the M79 originally used a [[flechette round]] of 45 10-grain steel [[flechettes|flechette]], but it proved ineffective because the flechettes would spin horizontally and bounce off the target. Afterward, the [[M576E1|M576 40mm grenade]] and E2 were developed, with 20 and 27 24-grain metal pellets respectively. Despite the increased pellet count, the [[spread|bullet spread]] of the E2 made it more ineffective compared to the E1.

ZEXAL|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]}}. It is the [[creator|creation]] of the [[universe]] and the [[Numeron Code|Numeron Code (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. Numeron Dragon is a large [[dragon]] resembling a Chinese dragon. It was eventually reborn as a Number Monster and played a huge role in the final fight against [[Don Thousand|Don Thousand (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] as it directly resulted in the destruction of [[Number C1000: Numerounius]] and played a crucial role in boosting the attack points of [[Number 39: Utopia]] to allow it to beat over the [[100,000|100000]] [[attack points|Attack (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] of [[Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia]].&sp<<hr Before Rebirth hr>>
The [[first]] bit of [[lore]] revealed about Numeron Dragon comes from the 133rd episode of {{iYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL}}. In that episode, it was revealed that the Numeron Dragon was the first being to exist. As the first being in existence, Numeron Dragon got lonely, and so it used its power to create the universe. However, doing so drained it of almost all of its power and nearly killed it. Wanting to see the future of its creation, Numeron Dragon shed one singular tear. That tear had traveled throughout the cosmos and eventually impacted the [[Earth]], and from that impact formed the [[Moon]]. That impact also buried the Numeron Code on Earth. The tear that impacted the Earth contained all the knowledge and emotions of itself. Numeron Dragon then used the power of the Numbers to hide away the existence of the Numeron Code. Lastly, Numeron Dragon left a record detailing the location of the key to the Numeron Code, after which, Numeron Dragon vanished.&sp<<hr Rebirth hr>>In episode 134 of the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL}} anime, Numeron Dragon was reborn as [[Number 100: Numeron Dragon]]. During [[Kaito Tenjo|Kaito Tenjo (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] and [[Mizael|Mizael (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]'s duel on the Moon, the conditions specified in the [[Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time|Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] were met. [[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]], [[Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon]], and [[Number 46: Dragluon]] resonated together, and summoned Numeron Dragon from the Moon. Numeron Dragon was reborn as Number 100: Numeron Dragon. As Kaito was dying, he entrusted Number 100: Numeron Dragon to Mizael.`,

They are the main focus of the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL}} [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Each Number Monster has a corresponding [[natural number]] at the start of its name after "Number" or another letter like in the case of Chaos Numbers, Shining Numbers, etc. There are only two exceptions to that.<<note(content=Number XX: Utopic Dark Infinity and Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia (text=noteCountnote>> Numbers come in a few different varieties. There are the Emperor's Key Numbers, Barian Numbers, Over-Hundred Numbers, Chaos Numbers, Shining Numbers, Future Numbers, and Chaos Imaginary Numbers. In the anime, all Numbers share the effect that they cannot be destroyed in battle except by other Numbers, contrary to the card game. The effects of Numbers oftentimes differ between the anime, manga, and card game.<<hrEmperor's Key Numbershr>>Emperor's Key Numbers are the Numbers that came from the [[Emperor's Key|Emperor's Key (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. These Numbers are the fragments of [[Astral's|Astral (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] memories. The Emperor's Key Numbers have the 2nd highest amount of members to it at 100. These Numbers are the original Numbers. Of the original Numbers, 30 never appeared or were mentioned in the {{iZEXAL}} anime or manga. Those Numbers are 18, 24, 26, 27, 29, 36, 41, 45, 49, 51, 55, 57, 59, 60, 67, 68, 71, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 81, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 97, and 98.<<hrBarian Numbershr>>The Barian Numbers are the Numbers created by [[Don Thousand|Don Thousand (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. These Numbers have the most members at [[1,000,000|1000000]]. Of those 1,000,000 created Numbers, only 5 are known by name. Those known Barian Numbers are Infection Buzzking, Ninja Shadow Mosquito, Cicada King, Stealth Kragen, and Dark Illumiknight.<<hrOver-Hundred Numbershr>>The Over-Hundred Numbers are, as the name suggests, Numbers that have a natural number of over 100. These Numbers were the signature cards of the [[Seven Barian Emperors|Seven Barian Emperors (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. These Numbers were created by Don Thousand in order to suppress the Emperor's memories of their past lives when they were humans. It should be specified that there was only 1 Over-Hundred Number not created by Don Thousand, and that was Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon which was instead created by the [[Numeron Dragon|Numeron Dragon (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]].<<hrChaos Numbershr>>Chaos Numbers are evolved versions of Numbers that are summoned by overlaying their base number and a special card, typically a [[Rank-Up-Magic|Rank-Up-Magic (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] card or another card that allows for the summoning of a Chaos Number such as [[Don Thousand's Throne|Don Thousand's Throne Card (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]].<<hr2Chaos Imaginary Numbershr2>>Chaos Imaginary Numbers are Chaos Numbers that have evolved even further beyond.<<hrShining Numbershr>>Shining Number Monsters are a type of evolved Number monster that only exists in the manga.

Eight sections are labeled with [[numbers|number]] with eight messages hidden underneath the construction's [[flaps|flap]]. The main purpose, as its most common name suggests, is to [[tell fortunes|fortune telling]] by having a person manipulate the fortune teller based on answers given by someone else. As its construction only requires a single piece [[paper|paper sheet]] and optionally [[scissors]], it can be easily made by children.<<hrConstructionhr>><<img(src=git/paper fortune teller made.gif(cap=A guide on making a paper fortune teller.img>>To create a paper fortune teller, obtain a piece of paper and scissors if the paper is not already a [[square]], then: ::Fold the top left corner of the paper as close to the bottom right corner.|Fold the top right corner as close to the bottom left.|If the paper is rectangular, use the scissors to remove the overhanging piece of paper.|Unfold the paper back into a square.|Fold all four corners into the middle, creating a smaller square.|Flip the paper over.|Fold all four corners into the middle again.|Fold the square in half along one of the creases.|Pop open the corners with your fingers.::After the fortune teller is created, unfold the entire construction to color and write inside. The following is what is typically used for customizing a fortune teller: ::Color the four corners, shown with folds that resemble squares, red, blue, green, and yellow.|Complete steps 5 and 6, returning to the flipped-over smaller square.|Write eight messages in each of the triangular sections in the corners of the square.|Complete step 7, making the even smaller square.|Write the numbers 1 through 8 in the remaining eight triangular sections.|Complete steps 8 and 9, finishing the fortune teller.::<<hrUsagehr>>To use a paper fortune teller, hold each side of the fortune teller using both hands. Put your index fingers in the back two corners and your thumbs in the front two. Press all the corners together to close the fortune teller. The fortune teller can be opened by extending the index fingers and thumbs apart or moving the hands apart.<<hr2Fortune tellinghr2>>The person holding the fortune teller is the "teller," while the other person answering questions is the "player." The teller asks the player to pick one of the four colors corresponding to the colored corners. After a color is selected, the teller says each letter in the color aloud and closes and opens the fortune teller for each letter. Then, the teller will ask the player to select a number. The teller will close and open the fortune teller that many times. Lastly, the player will select one final number. Flatten out the fortune teller and unfold the flap. Read out the fortune underneath the selected number.<<hr3Similar useshr3>>Alteratively from telling fortunes, the fortune teller can have other uses based on the messages written. It can be used as a [[Magic 8 Ball]] by writing "Yes," "No," "Ask again later," and other similar messages. It can be used as an [[ice breaker|social ice breaker]] by having personal questions, such as "What is your [[favorite food]]?", "Do you own any [[pets|pet]]?", "Do you like [[pineapple on pizza]]?", and so on. Fortune tellers may also be based on [[franchises|franchise]], including {{i[[Harry Potter]]}}, {{i[[Star Wars]]}}, and {{i[[The Wizard of Oz]]}}. Realistically, any message can be put inside a fortune teller, making it a very versatile and customizable toy.<<hr2Cootie catchinghr2>>The cootie catcher can be used to grab [[cooties]], an [[imaginary]] [[disease]], from people. This is done by opening up the catcher, placing it close to the target, then closing the catcher to snag the cooties. To make it easier to manipulate, use the thumb and three fingers from the same hand to open the catcher. Markings and colors are not needed, but decoration is recommended to make it more appealing. The cootie catcher has even been seen in [[cartoons|cartoon]], as a [[cootie catcher|Cootie Catcher (Teen Titans Go!)]] appears in {{i[[Teen Titans Go!]]}} "[[Boys vs Girls|Boys vs Girls (Teen Titans Go!)]]".<<hr2Salt dispensinghr2>>The form of the fortune teller can be used as a [[salt cellar]] when flipped upside down. The four pockets created can be used to hold [[salt]], however, this functionality is almost never used today. Children would have also used the pockets to store other [[sweets|candy]] and [[biscuts|biscut]].`,

After practicing the jumps he memorized from the Temple, he returned and found the barrier block that gave an invisible route around the impossible jump.

The master who gave Evbo the totem of undying tells Evbo that from the tallest highway, there is a special building.

Upon standing on the pedestal, he sees his memory of being with SeawattGaming before the Parkour Civilization began. Entering his own [[username|username (Minecraft)]] into the screen, it displayed him as a parkour noob. Evbo ducked behind a bush when he saw a player fall onto the pedestal and Seawatt approach the screen. The player failed a 1 block jump, with Seawatt marking him in the book as a noob. Seawatt, noticing Evbo behind the bush, tells him that every new player gets a false memory of a "before" when they join.

Evbo continues to the Master Level, where he locates the friendly parkour master to get some blocks. He then bribes the teller at the Parkour Bank to open the vault, only finding a water bucket, brewing stands, and a few more blocks. Evbo then confronts Seawatt, applying [[Slowness|Slowness (Minecraft)]] using brewing stands to force him to talk, where he confesses that the parkour champion uses barriers to make impossible jumps, before sending him back to the Parkour Arena. Evbo and the champion duke it out, with it coming down to a [[triple neo]]. The parkour champion falls, but Evbo makes it. He is teleported back to the Master Level, where he finds a now-visible pathway up the [[Parkour Temple|Parkour Master Temple (Parkour Civilization)]], which leads to the [[Champion Level|Champion Level (Parkour Civilization)]].

On the Pro Level, there were empty prison cells and a parkour race set up in the middle, suggesting that they were all killed. The Master Layer was the same, but the prison cells had people inside. The Parkour Villain tells Evbo that he will use the command blocks to wipe Evbo before a scared parkour master challenges Evbo to a race. Evbo wins, killing the master, before returning the climb. Despite not being able to see the pathway up the master portion of the Parkour Temple, Evbo memorized it and completed the invisible jumps. After reaching the top, Evbo sees the Parkour Villain and a complex course set up. The Parkour Villain started a race with Evbo. Unbeknownst to Evbo, his side of the course wasn't fully complete, stopping him from reaching the end. Deciding that he would die if he stayed still, Evbo in a last-ditch effort jumps into the air. He finds himself and the parkour god standing on two grass blocks, with the parkour god determining that Evbo will be his successor. The parkour god tells Evbo that he will become parkour, before disappearing. Evbo returns to falling, with his [[chainmail boots|chainmail boots (Minecraft)]] turning into [[netherite boots|netherite boots (Minecraft)]] while conjuring a ladder to grab hold of.

It is revealed that the parkour master friend is now the parkour champion, with Evbo the new parkour god. Evbo then makes one final jump off the Parkour Temple and disappears.<<hr2Minecraft but I survive AGAIN in PARKOUR CIVILIZATION [FULL MOVIE]hr2>>{{tMain page: [[Minecraft but I survive AGAIN in PARKOUR CIVILIZATION [FULL MOVIE&#93;]]}}&sp{{bMovie of Season}} 2&sp{{bRelease:}} June 1, 2024&sp{{bLink:}} <<link(src=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIzzMDDncnE(text=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIzzMDDncnElink>>&sp{{bLength:}} 1:53:19&sp{{bDescription:}} Minecraft but I survive AGAIN in PARKOUR CIVILIZATION...the entire 2nd movie of my journey in parkour civilization, where the only way to live is to parkour...&sp{{bSynopsis:}} This movie compiles all the events from the last 10 episodes in {{iParkour Civilization}}, from Evbo learning about a new, mysterious Level to his succession to becoming parkour god.`,

Normally, with just Photograph and Hanging Chad, there would be 3 card triggers (1 normally, 2 from Hanging Chad) and 1 Photograph trigger. To find the final Mult multiplier, follow {{code2{{s-u({{iC{{s-bt}}}} * {{iP{{s-bt}})}}}}}}, where {{iC{{s-bt}}}} is a card trigger and {{iP{{s-bt}}}} is a Photograph trigger. With the most basic Photochad, the Mult multiplier would be {{code2{{s-u(3 * 1)}} = 2{{s-u3}} = 8}}. For example, using 2 Photographs, 1 Hanging Chad, 1 Blueprint, and 1 Brainstorm, the optimal setup is copying 1 Photograph for 3 {{iP{{s-bt}}}} in total and 1 Hanging Chad for 5 {{iC{{s-bt}}}} in total. The Mult multiplier would be {{code2{{s-u(5 * 3)}} = 2{{s-u15}} = 32,768}} for the optimized combination. The following table is a quick reference for how different values for {{iC{{s-bt}}}} (horizontal axis) and {{iP{{s-bt}}}} (vertical axis) impact Mult multiplier, with a balance between {{iC{{s-bt}}}} and {{iP{{s-bt}}}} having a higher Mult multiplier overall:<<table|{{c{{b1}}}}|{{c{{b2}}}}|{{c{{b3}}}}|{{c{{b4}}}}|{{c{{b5}}}}||{{b1}}|{{r2}}|{{r4}}|{{r8}}|{{r16}}|{{r32}}||{{b2}}|{{r4}}|{{r16}}|{{r64}}|{{r256}}|{{r1,024}}||{{b3}}|{{r8}}|{{r64}}|{{r512}}|{{r4,096}}|{{r32,768}}||{{b4}}|{{r16}}|{{r256}}|{{r4,096}}|{{r65,536}}|{{r1,048,576}}||{{b5}}|{{r32}}|{{r1,024}}|{{r32,768}}|{{r1,048,576}}|{{r33,554,432}}table>>`,

It’s spooky. It’s a meta picture book that puts a fresh spin on an old joke and elevates chicken comedy to ghastly new levels. A little spring chicken crosses the road but quickly gets flattened under a semitruck. The barnyard beasts who’ve gone before break the news: now that Chicken’s fried—dispatched to the Other Side—Chicken has a job, an unwanted job, as a noisy troublemaking ghost. This fowl may be weak in the beak, but Chicken knows that scaring people isn’t nice. There is such a thing as a friendly ghost, after all—isn’t there? Loaded with laughs and shivers, this Halloween-ready treat features ghoulishly funny art by the illustrator of the #1 {{iNew York Times}} best-selling Bad Seed series. Let the haunting begin!&p{{iNo chickens were harmed in the making of this book.}}quo>><<hrReviewshr>><<AsofJanuary 2024>>, this book has a rating of 4.6/5 stars on [[Amazon|Amazon (company)]].<<ref(content=link|https://www.amazon.com/Poultrygeist-Eric-Geron/dp/1536210501(text=refCountref>> Here are a few ratings:&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Readerella, United States on December 9, 2021&sp{{bSpooktacular!}}&spBeautiful illustrations and hilarious story!

Tweet yourself...I mean, treat!&p⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Pop Bop, United States on August 22, 2021&sp{{bCharming; But Who is This For?}}&spThis book is a total hoot - with an appealing chicken hero, a clever premise, and witty puns. The setup is simple enough. A chicken is crossing the road and is flattened by an oncoming truck. Instead of getting to the other side he wakes up on "the other side". Our ghost chicken wants to be a good ghost, but the ghosts of all the other road kill want it to be a scary ghost. What a fine twist on an old joke. Engagingly drawn and fast paced.&pBut who is this for? Reflecting on our little guys, one would be creeped out, one would think it hilarious, one would be indifferent, and the littlest would run around the house for days pretending to be road kill. I sort of like the idea of this just as an experiment before moving on to more ghoulish treats. (After all, the chicken is pretty friendly.) And I often think we don't give kids enough credit for being able to take a joke. But I'd still probably not choose this for bedtime.&p(Please note that I received a free advance will-self-destruct-in-x-days Adobe Digital copy of this book without a review requirement, or any influence regarding review content should I choose to post a review.

I loved everything about it, starting with the nice bright white pages and larger than standard font, which makes reading it a breeze.  Joyce Russell has a real gift for storytelling.  She's funny, honest, ratable and from the heart.  Her very short anecdotes of her life, from a child to present day, really hit home.  I will look at life's situations differently and apply Joyce Russell's methods for going the extra mile to make any situation a win-win for everyone.  This book is an excellent reminder that it is the little things that one can do to really make a huge difference in lives and situations, whether business or personal. Going the extra mile does pay off in many, many ways.&pLiz Patton&p⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - susan mclaughlin, United States on August 19, 2020&sp{{bWise, practical and inspiring!}}&spI love Joyce! Who wouldn't?

Arthur's Fourth State of the Union Address}}, was a [[State of the Union Address]] made by [[Chester A. Arthur]], presented on December 1, 1884.<<hrAddresshr>>To the [[Congress of the United States]]:&pSince the close of your last session the [[American|Americans]] people, in the exercise of their highest right of [[suffrage]], have chosen their [[Chief Magistrate]] for the four years ensuing.&pWhen it is remembered that at no period in the [[country's history|History of the United States]] has the long political contest which customarily precedes the day of the [[national election|United States election]] been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subject of general congratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over, and while the slight preponderance by which the issue had been determined was as yet unascertained, the [[public peace]] suffered no disturbance, but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result.&pNothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the [[American citizen]], his love of order, and his loyalty to [[law|United States law]]. Nothing could more signally demonstrate the [[strength]] and [[wisdom]] of our political institutions.&pEight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of a national election sharply called the attention of the Congress to the necessity of providing more precise and definite regulations for counting the [[electoral vote]].&pIt is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the Presidency shall again distract the country, and I am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief thus far proposed would be preferred to continued inaction.&pOur [[relations with all foreign powers|United States foreign relations]] continue to be amicable.&pWith [[Belgium]] a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present treaties has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country within the jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and alienation of property. A [[trade-marks|trademark]] treaty has also been concluded.&pThe [[war|War of the Pacific]] between [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] is at an end. For the arbitration of the claims of American citizens who during its continuance suffered through the acts of the Chilean authorities a convention will soon be negotiated.&pThe state of hostilities between [[France]] and [[China]] continues to be an embarrassing feature of our Eastern relations. The [[Chinese Government]] has promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens whose property was destroyed in the recent [[riots|1880 Riots at Canton]] at [[Canton|Canton, Colorado]]. I renew the recommendation of my last [[annual]] [[message]], that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China.&pThe true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country permitting the restriction of [[Chinese immigration|Chinese immigration to the United States]] is likely to be again the subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously questioned whether the statute passed at the last session does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return certificates valid under the old law, and who now seem to be debarred from relanding for lack of the certificates required by the new.&pThe recent purchase by citizens of the United States of a large trading fleet heretofore under the Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our commercial importance in the East. In view of the large number of vessels built or purchased by American citizens in other countries and exclusively employed in legitimate traffic between foreign [[ports|port]] under the recognized protection of our flag, it might be well to provide a uniform [[rule]] for their [[registration]] and [[documentation]], so that the [[bona fide]] [[property rights]] of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded.&pPursuant to the advice of the [[Senate|Senate of the United States]] at the last session, I recognized the flag of the [[International Association of the Kongo]] as that of a friendly [[government]], avoiding in so doing any prejudgment of conflicting [[territorial claims|territorial claim]] in that [[region]]. Subsequently, in execution of the expressed wish of the Congress, I appointed a commercial agent for the [[Kongo basin]].&pThe importance of the rich prospective trade of the [[Kongo Valley]] has led to the general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon equal terms. At an international conference for the consideration of this subject called by the [[Emperor|Emeror of Germany]] of [[Germany]], and now in session at [[Berlin]], delegates are in attendance on behalf of the [[United States]]. Of the results of the conference you will be duly advised.&pThe [[Government|Governent of Korea]] of [[Korea]] has generously aided the efforts of the United States minister to secure suitable premises for the use of the [[legation]]. As the conditions of [[diplomatic intercourse]] with Eastern [[nations|nation]] demand that the legation premises be owned by the represented power, I advise that an appropriation be made for the acquisition of this property by the Government. The United States already possess valuable premises at [[Tangier]] as a gift from the [[Sultan|Sultan of Morocco]] of [[Morocco]]. As is stated hereafter, they have lately received a similar [[gift]] from the [[Siamese]] Government. The Government of [[Japan]] stands ready to present to us extensive grounds at [[Tokyo]] whereon to erect a suitable building for the legation, [[court-house|courthouse]], and [[jail]], and similar privileges can probably be secured in China and [[Persia]]. The owning of such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present [[rentals|rental]], but would permit of the due assertion of extraterritorial rights in those countries, and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States.&pThe failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at the autonomous court of the [[Khedive]] has proved a serious embarrassment in our intercourse with [[Egypt]]; and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this Government as one of the treaty powers in all matters of administration there affecting the rights of foreigners, I advise the restoration of the agency and consulate-general at [[Cairo]] on its former basis. I do not conceive it to be the wish of Congress that the United States should withdraw altogether from the honorable position they have [[hitherto]] held with respect to the Khedive, or that citizens of this Republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid and protection of a competent representative.&pWith [[France]] the traditional cordial relationship continues. The colossal [[statue of Liberty Enlightening the World]], the generous gift of the people of France, is expected to [[reach|shipping the Statue of Liberty]] [[New York]] in May next. I suggest that Congressional action be taken in recognition of the spirit which has prompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal upon which it is to be placed.&pOur relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some of the best elements of citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United States have extradition treaties with several of the [[German States]], but by reason of the confederation of those States under the imperial rule the application of such treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as the interests of the two countries require. I propose, therefore, to open negotiations for a single convention of extradition to embrace all the territory of the [[Empire|German Empire]].&pIt affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with [[Great Britain]] continues to be of a most friendly character.&pThe Government of [[Hawaii]] has indicated its willingness to continue for seven years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in view of the relations of that country to the American system of States, should, in my judgment, be favored.&pThe revolution in Hayti against the established Government has terminated. While it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our neutrality laws by instituting proceedings against individuals and vessels charged with their infringement. These prosecutions were in all cases successful.&pMuch anxiety has lately been displayed by various European Governments, and especially by the Government of [[Italy]], for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art. It is well to consider whether the present discrimination in favor of the productions of American [[artists|artist]] abroad is not likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may, in the practical [[exclusion]] of our [[painters|painter]] and [[sculptors|sculptor]] from the rich fields for [[observation]], [[study]], and [[labor]] which they have hitherto enjoyed.&pThere is prospect that the long-pending revision of the foreign treaties of Japan may be concluded at a new conference to be held at Tokyo. While this Government fully recognizes the equal and independent station of Japan in the community of nations, it would not oppose the general adoption of such terms of compromise as Japan may be disposed to offer in furtherance of a uniform policy of intercourse with Western nations.&pDuring the past year the increasing [[good will]] between our own Government and that of [[Mexico]] has been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial reciprocity concluded January 20, 1883, has been ratified and awaits the necessary [[tariff]] legislation of Congress to become effective. This legislation will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your attention.&pA full treaty of [[commerce]], [[navigation]], and [[consular rights]] is much to be desired, and such a treaty I have reason to believe that the Mexican Government stands ready to conclude.&pSome embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its last session to provide means for the due execution of the treaty of July 29, 1882, for the resurvey of the Mexican boundary and the relocation of [[boundary monuments|boundary monument]].&pWith the [[Republic of Nicaragua]] a treaty has been concluded which authorizes the [[construction]] by the United States of a [[canal]], [[railway]], and [[telegraph line]] across the Nicaraguan territory.&pBy the terms of this treaty 60 [[miles|mile]] of the [[river]] [[San Juan|San Juan River (Nicaragua)]], as well as [[Lake Nicaragua]], an inland [[sea]] 40 miles in width, are to constitute a part of the projected enterprise.&pThis leaves for actual canal construction 17 miles on the [[Pacific|Pacific Ocean]] side and 36 miles on the [[Atlantic|Atlantic Ocean]]. To the United States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is for the ordinary purposes of commerce practically cut off from communication by water with the Atlantic ports, the political and commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated.&pIt is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality of its provisions will command universal approval at home and abroad.&pThe death of our representative at [[Russia]] while at his post at [[St. Petersburg|Saint Petersburg]] afforded to the Imperial Government a renewed opportunity to testify its sympathy in a manner befitting the intimate friendliness which has ever marked the intercourse of the two countries.&pThe course of this Government in raising its representation at [[Bangkok]] to the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship and augurs well for our enlarged intercourse. The Siamese Government has presented to the United States a commodious [[mansion]] and grounds for the occupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution Congress attest its appreciation of this generous gift.&pThis government has more than once been called upon of late to take action in fulfillment of its international obligations toward [[Spain]]. Agitation in the island of [[Cuba]] hostile to the [[Spanish Crown|Spanish royalty]] having been fomented by persons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which our territory affords, the officers of this Government have been instructed to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at [[Key West]] and at other points near the Cuban coast. I am happy to say that in the only instance where these precautionary measures were successfully eluded the offenders, when found in our territory, were subsequently tried and convicted.&pThe growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the [[Spanish Antilles]] and their natural market in the United States led to the adoption in January last of a commercial agreement looking to that end. This agreement has since been superseded by a more carefully framed and comprehensive convention, which I shall submit to the Senate for approval. It has been the aim of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of productions carried under the flag of either country as to make the intercourse between Cuba and [[Puerto Rico]] and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the commercial movement between our domestic ports, and to insure a removal of the burdens on shipping in the [[Spanish Indies]], of which in the past our shipowners and shipmasters have so often had cause to complain.&pThe negotiation of this convention has for a time postponed the prosecution of certain claims of our citizens which were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late Spanish-American Claims Commission, and which are therefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment. The speedy settlement of these claims will now be urged by this Government.&pNegotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the [[Dominican Republic]] have been successfully concluded, and the result will shortly be laid before the Senate.&pCertain questions between the United States and the [[Ottoman Empire]] still remain unsolved. Complaints on behalf of our citizens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The [[Porte|Sublime Porte]] has sought to withhold from our commerce the right of favored treatment to which we are entitled by existing conventional stipulations, and the revision of the tariffs is unaccomplished.&pThe final disposition of pending questions with [[Venezuela]] has not as yet been reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlement which will provide the means of reexamining the [[Caracas]] awards in conformity with the expressed desire of Congress, and which will recognize the justice of certain [[claims|claim]] preferred against Venezuela.&pThe Central and South American Commission appointed by authority of the act of July 7, 1884, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the general policy of the Government for enlarging its [[commercial intercourse]] with American States. The commissioners have been actively preparing for their responsible task by holding conferences in the principal cities with merchants and others interested in [[Central|Central America]] and [[South American|South America]] trade.&pThe [[International Meridian Conference]] lately convened in [[Washington|Washington D.C.]] upon the invitation of the Government of the United States was composed of representatives from twenty-five nations. The conference concluded its labors on the 1st of November, having with substantial unanimity agreed upon the [[meridian|Prime meridian (Greenwich)]] of [[Greenwich]] as the starting point whence longitude is to be computed through 180 [[degrees|degree (angle)]] eastward and westward, and upon the adoption, for all purposes for which it may be found convenient, of a universal [[day]] which shall begin at [[midnight]] on the initial meridian and whose [[hours|hour]] shall be counted from zero up to twenty-four. The formal report of the transactions of this conference will be hereafter transmitted to the Congress.&pThis Government is in frequent receipt of invitations from foreign states to participate in international exhibitions, often of great interest and importance. Occupying, as we do, an advanced position in the world's production, and aiming to secure a profitable share for our industries in the general competitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means for participation in these exhibitions should so often exclude our producers from advantages enjoyed by those of other countries. During the past year the attention of Congress was drawn to the formal invitations in this regard tendered by the Governments of [[England]], [[Holland]], [[Belgium]], Germany, and [[Austria]]. The Executive has in some instances appointed honorary commissioners. This is, however, a most unsatisfactory expedient, for without some provision to meet the necessary working expenses of a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors. An [[International Inventions Exhibition]] is to be held in [[London]] next May. This will cover a field of special importance, in which our country holds a foremost rank; but the Executive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of our vast national interests in this direction.&pI have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to me that a statute giving to the Executive general discretionary authority to accept such invitations and to appoint honorary commissioners, without salary, and placing at the disposal of the [[Secretary of State]] a small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses, would be of great public utility.&pThis Government has received official notice that the revised international regulations for preventing collisions at sea have been adopted by all the leading maritime powers except the United States, and came into force on the 1st of September last. For the due protection of our shipping interests the provisions of our statutes should at once be brought into conformity with these regulations.&pThe question of securing to [[authors|author]], [[composers|composer]], and artists [[copyright]] privileges in this country in return for reciprocal rights abroad is one that may justly challenge your attention. It is true that conventions will be necessary for fully accomplishing this result; but until Congress shall by statute fix the extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall be here privileged it has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such conventions. For this reason the United States were not represented at the recent conference at [[Berne|Bern]].&pI recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be so enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and aimed against the [[peace]] of a friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the shipment of [[explosives]], though the enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to international [[obligations|obligation]], but simply for the protection of passenger travel. All these statutes were intended to meet special [[emergencies|emergency]] that had already arisen. Other emergencies have arisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies means for the organization of hostilities without open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering parties.&pI see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission of criminal acts such as are here under consideration should not be alike punishable whether such acts are intended to be committed in our own country or in a foreign country with which we are at peace. The prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which intimately concerns the national honor.&pOur existing naturalization laws also need revision. Those sections relating to persons residing within the limits of the United States in 1795 and 1798 have now only a historical interest. [[Section 2172|Section 2172 of the Revised Statutes]]<<comment Check https://fam.state.gov/fam/08fam/08fam030109.html for more info comment>>, recognizing the [[citizenship|American citizenship]] of the [[children]] of [[naturalized|Naturalization]] [[parents|parent]], is ambiguous in its terms and partly obsolete. There are special provisions of law favoring the naturalization of those who serve in the [[Army|United States Army]] or in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges are granted those who serve in the [[Navy|United States Navy]] or the [[Marine Corps|United States Marine Corps]].&p"An uniform rule of naturalization" such as the [[Constitution|United States Constitution]] contemplates should, among other things, clearly define the status of persons born within the United States subject to a foreign power (section 1992) and of minor children of [[fathers|father]] who have declared their intention to become citizens but have failed to perfect their naturalization. It might be wise to provide for a central [[bureau]] of registry, wherein should be filed authenticated [[transcripts|transcript]] of every [[record]] of naturalization in the several Federal and State courts, and to make provision also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in cases where [[fraud]] had been practiced upon the court by the applicant himself or where he had renounced or forfeited his acquired citizenship. A just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hands of the Government in protecting its citizens abroad and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturalization with foreign countries.&pThe legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service certain changes and reductions which have been productive of embarrassment. The [[population]] and commercial activity of our country are steadily on the increase, and are giving rise to new, varying, and often delicate relationships with other countries. Our foreign establishment now embraces nearly double the area of operations that it occupied twenty years ago. The confinement of such a service within the limits of expenditure then established is not, it seems to me, in accordance with true economy. A community of 60,000,000 people should be adequately represented in its intercourse with foreign nations.&pA project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting the scheme of extraterritorial jurisdiction is now before you. If the limits of a short session will not allow of its full consideration, I trust that you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of the service.&pIt has been customary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of each diplomatic office to which a salary is attached. I suggest that this course be abandoned and that it be left to the [[President|President of the United States]], with the advice and consent Of the Senate, to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade of the representatives of this Government abroad as may seem advisable, provision being definitely made, however, as now, for the amount of [[salary]] attached to the respective stations.&pThe condition of our finances and the operations of the various branches of the public service which are connected with the [[Treasury Department|United States Department of the Treasury]] are very fully discussed in the report of the Secretary.&pIt appears that the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1884, were:&spFrom [[customs]] - $195,067,489.76&spFrom internal [[revenue]] - $121,586,072.51&spFrom all other sources - $31,866,307.65&spTotal ordinary revenues - $348,519,869.92&pThe public expenditures during the same period were:&spFor civil expenses - $22,312,907.71&spFor foreign intercourse - $1,260,766.37&spFor Indians - $6,475,999.29&spFor [[pensions|pension]] - $55,429,228.06&spFor the [[military establishment]], including river and harbor improvements and arsenals - $39,429,603.36&spFor the [[naval establishment]], including vessels, machinery, and improvements at navy-yards - $17,292,601.44&spFor miscellaneous expenditures, including public [[buildings|building]], [[light-houses|lighthouse]], and collecting the revenue - $43,939,710.00&spFor expenditures on account of the [[District of Columbia]] - $3,407,049.62&spFor [[interest]] on the public [[debt]] - $54,578,378.48&spFor the [[sinking fund]] - $46,790,229.50&spTotal ordinary expenditures - $290,926,473.83&spLeaving a [[surplus]] of - $57,603,396.09&pAs compared with the preceding [[fiscal year]], there was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in the amount of expenditures. The aggregate receipts were less than those of the year previous by about $54,000,000. The falling off in revenue from customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of this deficiency, and about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from internal [[taxation]].&pThe Secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will end June 30, 1885, at $330,000,000 and the total expenditures at $290,620,201.16, in which sum are included the [[interest]] on the debt and the amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for the entire year of about $39,000,000.&pThe value of [[exports]] from the United States to foreign countries during the year ending June 30, 1884, was as follows:&spDomestic [[merchandise]] - $724,964,852&spForeign merchandise - $15,548,757&spTotal merchandise - $740,513,609&sp[[Specie]] - $67,133,383&spTotal exports of merchandise and specie - $807,646,992&pThe [[cotton]] and cotton manufactures included in this statement were valued at $208,900,415; the [[breadstuffs]] at $162,544,715; the provisions at $114,416,547, and the [[mineral oils|mineral oil]] at $47,103,248.&pDuring the same period the imports were as follows:&spMerchandise - $667,697,693&sp[[Gold]] and [[silver]] - $37,426,262&spTotal - $705,123,955&pMore than 63 per cent of the entire value of imported merchandise consisted of the following articles:&sp[[Sugar]] and [[molasses]] - $103,884,274&sp[[Wool]] and woolen manufactures - $53,842,292&sp[[Silk]] and its manufactures - $49,949,128&sp[[Coffee]] - $49,686,705&sp[[Iron]] and [[steel]] and manufactures thereof - $41,464,599&sp[[Chemicals|Chemical]] - $38,464,965&sp[[Flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], and like substances, and manufactures thereof - $33,463,398&spCotton and manufactures of cotton - $30,454,476&sp[[Hides|Hide]] and [[skins|Animal skin]] other than [[fur skins|fur skin]] - $22,350,906&pI concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the immediate suspension of the [[coinage]] of [[silver dollars|silver dollar]] and of the issuance of [[silver certificates|silver certificate]]. This is a matter to which in former communications I have more than once invoked the attention of the National Legislature.&pIt appears that annually for the past six years there have been coined, in Compliance with the requirements of the act of February 28, 1878, more than 27,000,000 silver dollars.&pThe number now outstanding is reported by the Secretary to be nearly 185,000,000, whereof but little more than 40,000,000, or less than 22 per cent, are in actual [[circulation|monetary circulation]]. The mere existence of this fact seems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute which has made such fact possible. But there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same direction.&pThe Secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended silver is likely at no distant day to become our sole metallic standard. The commercial disturbance and the impairment of [[national credit]] that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimated.&pI hope that the Secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal from circulation of the $1 and $2 notes will receive your approval. It is likely that a considerable portion of the silver now encumbering the vaults of the Treasury might thus find its way into the currency.&pWhile trade dollars have ceased, for the present at least, to be an element of active disturbance in our [[currency system]], some provision should be made for their surrender to the Government. In view of the circumstances under which they were coined and of the fact that they have never had a [[legal-tender|legal tender]] quality, there should be offered for them only a slight advance over their [[bullion]] value.&pThe Secretary in the course of his report considers the propriety of beautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins and of so increasing their weight that they may bear their due ratio of value to the standard [[dollar]]. His conclusions in this regard are cordially approved.&pIn my [[annual message of 1882|State of the Union 1882]] I recommended the abolition of all excise [[taxes|tex]] except those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is now renewed. In case these taxes shall be abolished the revenues that will still remain to the Government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the results of recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters those reductions can be most judiciously effected.&pOne of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of Congress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means for increasing our foreign trade and thus relieving the depression under which our industries are now languishing. The Secretary of the Treasury advises that the duty of investigating this subject be intrusted in the first instance to a competent commission. While fully recognizing the considerations that may be urged against this course, I am nevertheless of the opinion that upon the whole no other would be likely to effect speedier or better results.&pThat portion of the Secretary's report which concerns the condition of our shipping interests can not fail to command your attention. He emphatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment of American [[capital|financial capital]] in American [[steamships|steamship]] the Government shall, by liberal payments for [[mail transportation]] or otherwise, lend its active assistance to individual enterprise, and declares his belief that unless that course be pursued our foreign carrying trade must remain, as it is to-day, almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners.&pOne phase of this subject is now especially prominent in view of the [[repeal]] by the [[act of June 26, 1884|An act to remove certain burdens on the American merchant marine and encourage the American foreign carrying trade, and for other purposes]], of all statutory provisions arbitrarily compelling American vessels to carry the [[mails|mail]] to and from the United States. As it is necessary to make [[provision]] to [[compensate]] the [[owners|owner]] of such vessels for performing that service after April, 1885, it is hoped that the whole subject will receive early consideration that will lead to the enactment of such measures for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of Congress may devise.&pThe 3 [[per cent|percent]] [[bonds|bond (finance)]] of the Government to the [[amount]] of more than $100,000,000 have since my last annual message been redeemed by the Treasury. The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to little over $200,000,000, about one-fourth of which will be retired through the operations of the sinking fund during the coming year. As these bonds still constitute the chief basis for the circulation of the [[national banks|national bank]], the [[question]] how to avert the contraction of the currency caused by their retirement is one of constantly increasing importance.&pIt seems to be generally conceded that the law governing this matter exacts from the banks excessive security, and that upon their present bond deposits a larger circulation than is now allowed may be granted with safety. I hope that the bill which passed the Senate at the last session, permitting the issue of notes equal to the face value of the deposited bonds, will commend itself to the approval of the [[House of Representatives|United States House of Representatives]].&pIn the expenses of the [[War Department|United States Department of War]] the Secretary reports a decrease of more than $9,000,000. Of this reduction $5,600,000 was effected in the expenditures for rivers and [[harbors|harbor]] and $2,700,000 in expenditures for the [[Quartermaster's Department|United States Army Quartermaster Corps]].&pOutside of that Department the annual expenses of all the Army bureaus proper (except possibly the [[Ordnance Bureau|Bureau of Ordnance]]) are substantially fixed charges, which can not be materially diminished without a change in the numerical strength of the Army. The expenditures in the Quartermaster's Department can readily be subjected to administrative discretion, and it is reported by the Secretary of War that as a result of exercising such discretion in reducing the number of draft and pack animals in the Army the annual cost of supplying and caring for such [[animals|animal]] is now $1,108,085.90 less than it was in 1881.&pThe reports of [[military commanders|military commander]] show that the last year has been notable for its entire freedom from Indian outbreaks.&pIn defiance of the President's proclamation of July 1, 1884, certain intruders sought to make settlements in the [[Indian Territory]]. They were promptly removed by a detachment of troops.&pDuring the past session of Congress a bill to provide a suitable fire-proof building for the [[Army Medical Museum|Army Medical Museum and Library]] and the library of the Surgeon-General's Office received the approval of the Senate. A similar bill, reported favorably to the House of Representatives by one of its committees, is still pending before that body. It is hoped that during the coming session the measure may become a law, and that thereafter immediate steps may be taken to secure a place of safe deposit for these valuable collections, now in a state of insecurity.&pThe funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and harbors were prosecuted during the past year were derived from the appropriations of the [[act of August 2, 1882|Flood Control Act of 1882]], together with such few balances as were on hand from previous appropriations. The balance in the Treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1883, was $10,021,649.55. The amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1884 was $1,319,634.62 and the amount drawn from the Treasury during the fiscal year was $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of $3,112,580.63 in the Treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1884.&pThe Secretary of War submits the report of the Chief of Engineers as to the practicability of protecting our important [[cities|city]] on the seaboard by [[fortifications|fortification]] and other defenses able to repel modern methods of attack. The time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive, and when the possible result of delay in making such preparation is seriously considered delay seems inexcusable. For the most important cities--those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation--adequate defenses, inclusive of [[guns|gun]], may be made by the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000--a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of that amount is asked to begin the work, and I concur with the Secretary of War in urging that it be granted.&pThe War Department is proceeding with the conversion of 10-inch [[smoothbore]] guns into 8-inch [[rifles|rifle]] by lining the former with tubes of [[forged steel]] or of [[coil wrought iron]]. Fifty guns will be thus converted within the year. This, however, does not obviate the necessity of providing means for the construction of guns of the highest power both for the purposes of coast defense and for the armament of war vessels.&pThe [[report of the Gun Foundry Board]], appointed April 2, 1883, in pursuance of the act of March 3, 1883, was transmitted to Congress in a special message of February 18, 1884. In my message of March 26, 1884, I called attention to the recommendation of the board that the Government should encourage the production at private steel works of the required material for heavy [[cannon]], and that two Government [[factories|factory]], one for the Army and one for the Navy, should be established for the fabrication of guns from such [[material]]. No action having been taken, the board was subsequently reconvened to determine more fully the plans and estimates necessary for carrying out its recommendation. It has received information which indicates that there are responsible steel manufacturers in this country who, although not provided at present with the necessary plant, are willing to construct the same and to make bids for contracts with the Government for the supply of the requisite material for the heaviest guns adapted to modern [[warfare]] if a guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude, accompanied by a positive appropriation extending over a series of years, shall be made by Congress. All doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus removed, I renew my recommendation that such action be taken by Congress as will enable the Government to construct its own ordnance upon its own territory, and so to provide the armaments demanded by considerations of [[national safety]] and [[honor]].&pThe report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the progress which has been made on the new [[steel cruisers|steelcruiser]] authorized by the acts of August 5, 1882, and March 3, 1883. Of the four vessels under contract, one, the [[Chicago|USS {{iChicago}} (1885)]], of 4,500 [[tons|ton]], is more than half finished; the [[Atlanta|USS {{iAtlanta}} (1884)]], of 3,000 tons, has been successfully launched, and her machinery is now fitting; the [[Boston|USS {{iBoston}} (1884)]], also of 3,000 tons, is ready for launching, and the [[Dolphin|USS {{iDolphin}} (PG-24)]], a [[dispatch steamer]] of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery.&pCertain adverse [[criticisms|criticism]] upon the designs of these cruisers are discussed by the Secretary, who insists that the correctness of the conclusions reached by the Advisory Board and by the Department has been demonstrated by recent developments in [[shipbuilding]] abroad.&pThe machinery of the double-turreted monitors Puritan, Terror, and Amphitrite, contracted for under the act of March 3, 1883, is in process of construction. No work has been done during the past year on their armor for lack of the necessary appropriations. A fourth monitor, the Monadnock, still remains unfinished at the navy-yard in [[California]]. It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete these vessels and to provide also an armament for the monitor Miantonomoh.&pThe recommendations of the [[Naval Advisory Board|Naval Consulting Board]], approved by the Department, comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 tons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavily armed gunboats, one light cruising gunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one armored ram, and three [[torpedo boats|torpedo boat]]. The general designs, all of which are calculated to meet the existing wants of the service, are now well advanced, and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority.&pThe act of Congress approved August 7, 1882, authorized the removal to the United States of the bodies of Lieutenant-Commander [[George W. De Long]] and his companions of the [[Jeannette expedition]]. This removal has been successfully accomplished by Lieutenants [[Harber|Giles Harber]] and [[Schuetze|William Henry Schuetze]]. The [[remains|human remains]] were taken from their [[grave]] in the [[Lena Delta]] in March, 1883, and were retained at [[Yakutsk]] until the following [[winter]], the [[season]] being too far advanced to admit of their immediate [[transportation]]. They arrived at New York February 20, 1884, where they were received with suitable honors.&pIn pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress approved February 13, 1884, a naval expedition was fitted out for the relief of Lieutenant [[A. W. Greely|Adolphus Greely]], United States Army, and of the party who had been engaged under his command in [[scientific observations|Lady Franklin Bay Expedition]] at [[Lady Franklin Bay]]. The fleet consisted of the steam sealer [[Thetis|USS {{iThetis}} (1881)]], purchased in England; the [[Bear|USS {{iBear}}]], purchased at [[St. Johns|St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Newfoundland]], and the Alert, which was generously provided by the British Government. Preparations for the expedition were promptly made by the Secretary of the Navy, with the active cooperation of the Secretary of War. Commander [[George W. Coffin]] was placed in command of the Alert and Lieutenant [[William H. Emory]] in command of the Bear. The Thetis was intrusted to Commander [[Winfield S. Schley|Winfield Scott Schley]], to whom also was assigned the superintendence of the entire expedition.&pImmediately upon its arrival at [[Upernavik]] the fleet began the dangerous navigation of [[Melville Bay]], and in spite of every obstacle reached [[Littleton Island]] on June 22, a [[fortnight]] earlier than any vessel had before attained that point. On the same day it crossed over to [[Cape Sabine]], where Lieutenant Greely and the other [[survivors|survivor]] of his party were discovered. After taking on board the living and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July 17. They were appropriately received at [[Portsmouth|Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], [[N. H.|New Hampshire]], on August 1 and at [[New York]] on August 8. One of the bodies was landed at the former place. The others were put on shore at [[Governors Island]], and, with the exception of one, which was interred in the national cemetery, were forwarded thence to the destinations indicated by friends. The organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its success.&pIn this the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the Congress of the United States I can not too strongly urge upon its attention the duty of restoring our Navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterized it. As the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed, it is plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by considerations of wise [[economy]], of just regard for our [[future]] [[tranquillity]], and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of the Republic.&pThe report of the Postmaster-General acquaints you with the present condition and needs of the [[postal service]].&pIt discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in the rate of [[letter postage]] recommended in my message of December 4, 1882, and effected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been much less than was generally anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in receipts from letter postages for the year immediately succeeding the change of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only $2,275,000.&pThis is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to its former volume by the natural increase of sealed correspondence.&pI confidently repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual message that the single-rate [[postage]] upon drop letters be reduced to 1 cent wherever the payment of 2 cents is now required by law. The double rate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in operation, and it appears that at those offices the increase in the tax upon local letters defrays the cost not only of its own collection and delivery, but of the collection and delivery of all other mail matter. This is an inequality that ought no longer to exist.&pI approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that the unit of weight in the rating of first-class matter should be 1 [[ounce]] instead of one-half ounce, as it now is. In view of the [[statistics]] furnished by the Department, it may well be doubted whether the change would result in any loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the convenience of the public is beyond dispute.&pThe free-delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and the total number of offices in which it is now in operation is 159. Experience shows that its adoption, under proper conditions, is equally an accommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service. It is more than self-sustaining, and for the reasons urged by the Postmaster-General may properly be extended.&pIn the opinion of that officer it is important to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-delivery offices may be secured by payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might be made effective by employment of a special [[stamp]] whose cost should be commensurate with the expense of the extra service.&pIn some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to outstrip the Government mail carriers by affording for the prompt transmission of letters better facilities than have hitherto been at the command of the Post-Office.&pIt has always been the policy of the Government to discourage such enterprises, and in no better mode can that policy be maintained than in supplying the public with the most efficient mail service that, with due regard to its own best interests, can be furnished for its accommodation.&pThe Attorney-General renews the recommendation contained in his report of last year touching the fees of [[witnesses|witness]] and [[jurors|juror]].&pHe favors radical changes in the fee bill, the adoption of a system by which [[attorneys|attorney]] and [[marshals|marshal]] of the United States shall be compensated solely by [[salaries|salary]], and the erection by the Government of a [[penitentiary]] for the [[confinement]] of offenders against its laws.&pOf the varied governmental concerns in charge of the [[Interior Department|United States Department of the Interior]] the report of its Secretary presents an interesting summary. Among the topics deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations respecting our Indian affairs, the preemption and timber-culture acts, the failure of [[railroad companies|railroad company]] to take title to [[lands granted|land grant]] by the Government, and the operations of the [[Pension Office]], the [[Patent Office|United States Patent and Trademark Office]], the [[Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], and the Bureau of Education.&pAllusion has been made already to the circumstance that, both as between the different Indian tribes and as between the [[Indians|Native Americans]] and the [[whites|White (race)]], the past year has been one of unbroken peace.&pIn this circumstance the President is glad to find justification for the policy of the Government in its dealing with the Indian question and confirmation of the views which were fully expressed in his first communication to the Forty-seventh Congress.&pThe Secretary urges anew the enactment of a statute for the punishment of crimes committed on the [[Indian reservations|Indian reservation]], and recommends the passage of the bill now pending in the House of Representatives for the purchase of a tract of 18,000 square miles from the [[Sioux Reservation]]. Both these measures are worthy of approval.&pI concur with him also in advising the repeal of the preemption law, the enactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching lapsed grants to railroad companies, and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads under such guaranty as shall effectually secure its ultimate payment. The report of the Utah Commission will be read with interest.&pIt discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the [[prevention and punishment|United States laws against polygamy]] of [[polygamy]] in that Territory. I still believe that if that abominable practice can be suppressed by law it can only be by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the Constitution.&pI again recommend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute political control of the [[Territory|Territory of Utah]] of [[Utah]] and provide for the appointment of commissioners with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their hands.&pIn the course of this communication reference has more than once been made to the policy of this Government as regards the extension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare the general principles that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this direction. The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated:&pWe are a people apt in mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention. We cover a vast extent of territory rich in [[agricultural products|agricultural product]] and in nearly all the [[raw materials|raw material]] necessary for successful manufacture. We have a system of productive establishments more than sufficient to supply our own demands. The wages of labor are nowhere else so great. The scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and intellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present needs of the Government.&pThese are the elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the condition of the workingman, our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets provided for the sale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits of our industrial enterprises. The problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or reform.&pThe countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natural marts of [[supply and demand]]. It is from them that we should obtain what we do not produce or do not produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our [[fields|farm field]], our [[mills|mill]], and our [[workshops|workshop]] should flow, under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end:&pFirst. A series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of America which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of trade. The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce, in return for the admission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our own products, the benefits of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of the parties to the contract; the removal on both sides from the vessels so privileged of all tonnage dues and national imposts, so that those vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and those of the other contracting parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade; the removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries coming within the benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of the [[technical restrictions|technical restriction]] and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered.&pSecondly. The establishment of the consular service of the United States on a salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular fees not only as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the treaties.&pThirdly. The enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United States.&pFourthly. The establishment of an uniform currency basis for the countries of America, so that the coined products of our [[mines|mine]] may circulate on equal terms throughout the Whole system of [[commonwealths|commonwealth]]. This would require a monetary union of America, whereby the output of the bullion-producing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted in conformity with the population, [[wealth]], and commercial needs of each. As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock, the surplus production of our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver.&pTo the accomplishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by separate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed; and the favor which this enlarged policy has thus far received warrants the belief that its operations will ere long embrace all, or nearly all, the countries of this hemisphere.&pIt is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consideration should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia, and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff burdens on such of their wares as neither we nor the other American States are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a better market for our supplies of [[food]], of raw materials, and of the manufactures in which we excel.&pIt seems to me that many of the embarrassing elements in the great national conflict between protection and [[free trade]] may thus be turned to good account; that the [[revenue]] may be reduced so as no longer to [[overtax]] the people; that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome; that our shipping interests may be judiciously encouraged, the currency fixed on firm bases, and, above all, such an unity of interests established among the States of the American system as will be of great and ever-increasing advantage to them all.&pAll treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated or are in process of negotiation contain a provision deemed to be requisite under the clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of Representatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue.&pOn the 29th of February last I transmitted to the Congress the first annual report of the Civil Service Commission, together with communications from the heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government respecting the practical workings of the law under which the Commission had been acting. The good results therein foreshadowed have been more than realized.&pThe system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faithful [[public servants|public servant]] and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for [[public employment]].&pThe law has had the unqualified support of the President and of the heads of the several Departments, and the members of the Commission have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their report will shortly be submitted, and will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing [[statute]] as shall commend themselves to the Executive and the Commissioners charged with its administration.&pIn view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial community for a [[national bankrupt law|Bankrupy laws in the United States]], I hope that the differences of sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present session.&pThe pestilence which for the past two years has been raging in the countries of the East recently made its appearance in European ports with which we are in constant communication.&pThe then Secretary of the Treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation of the President, issued certain regulations restricting and for a time prohibiting the importation of rags and the admission of baggage of immigrants and of travelers arriving from infected quarters. Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the recommendation of the present Secretary that the Congress take action in the premises, and I also recommend the immediate adoption of such measures as will be likely to ward off the dreaded [[epidemic|1881–1896 cholera pandemic]] and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily extend to our shores.&pThe annual report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the operations of the several departments of its municipal government. I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to legislation, especially commending such as relate to a revision of the civil and criminal code, the performance of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the construction and occupation of wharves along the river front, and the erection of a suitable building for District offices.&pI recommend that in recognition of the eminent services of [[Ulysses S. Grant]], late General of the armies of the United States and twice President of this nation, the Congress confer upon him a suitable pension.&pCertain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have now, in obedience to the Constitution, recommended for your adoption.&pAs respects others of no less importance I shall content myself with renewing the recommendations already made to the Congress, without restating the grounds upon which such recommendations were based.&pThe [[preservation of forests|forest preservation]] on the public domain, the granting of Government aid for popular [[education]], the amendment of the Federal Constitution so as to make effective the disapproval by the President of particular items in appropriation bills, the enactment of statutes in regard to the filling of vacancies in the Presidential office, and the determining of vexed questions respecting Presidential inability are measures which may justly receive your serious consideration.&pAs the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service, I can not refrain from expressing to the members of the National Legislature with whom I have been brought into personal and official intercourse my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious cooperation with the Executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation.&pAnd to my fellow-citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accorded me in my administration of the executive department of this Government.`,

The origin of the segment is tied closely with the origin of the episode, where the [[writers|writer]] wanted to add more scenes with [[background characters|background character]], dedicating an entire episode around the idea. The staff were assigned parts based on their [[favorite]] [[characters|character]], which for Oakley was Chalmers.

The main problem of the article is that most of the [[statistics]] used to show that Wikipedia is declining and unreliable is over a [[decade]] old, not accounting for how modern Wikipedia has become one of the largest [[websites|website]] in the [[world|Earth]].<<hrArticle informationhr>>This article was created on March 12, 2007‎, originally as a redirect to [[Examples of Bias in Wikipedia|Examples of Bias in Wikipedia (Conservapedia)]]. On the same day, the page was given its first line of text, which was:<<quoWikipedia is free online attempt to combine human knowledge into one concise source. It is non biased.quo>>This vandalism was quickly reverted. The article, <<asofMarch 2024>>, has 139 cited sources.<<hrArticle contentshr>><<hr2Openinghr2>>The opening of the article goes over basic [[information]] and perceived [[liberal bias|liberal bias in Wikipedia]] of Wikipedia. They make many [[claims|claim]] throughout the opening, such as that Wikipedia potentially hosts content which [[sympathize with Nazis|Nazi sympathy]], that it discredits [[Conservative|Conservative (American politics)]] [[organizations|political organization]], and introducing liberal bias into articles regarding [[politics|American politics]].<<hr2Continuing loss of influencehr2>>This section quickly covers the decrease of [[influence|Wikipedia's influence]] compared to [[Siri]], [[Google|Google search]], and [[Quora]]. It notes a drop in activity and usage on Wikipedia between 2012 and 2013.<<hr2Unreliability of Wikipediahr2>>This section pushes the claim that Wikipedia is [[unreliable|Reliability of Wikipedia]] because of the nature of the open-editing system put in place on the website. Supposedly, information can be removed at any time for any reason, regardless of quality, only allowing the "majority of editors" the most voice on Wikipedia. They also claim that Wikipedia has paid [[public relations]] officials to constantly monitor and edit articles on the site, that Wikipedia is overly liberal to the point of affecting the quality of the site, that a substantial percentage of articles have some information which is unreliable or [[incorrect]], Wikipedia's [[sources|source]] are great for [[research]], that millions of articles are not [[educationally substantial|educational substance]], and that Wikipedia has fluctuating [[quality|Quality of Wikipedia]].<<hr2Originshr2>>The origins of Wikipedia are heavily [[summarized|summary]], where [[Bomis, Inc.]] was originally hosting the [[servers|Wikipedia servers]] for Wikipedia<<note(content=The article also adds the detail that Bomis, Inc. was hosting inappropriate mature content on the site, but does not develop on this point further in the origins of Wikipedia.(text=noteCountnote>> until the owner was given a [[lawsuit]] they lost, in which [[Jimbo Wales]] created the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to save the project. They also note that [[MediaWiki]] is what hosts both Wikipedia and Conservapedia and that Wikipedia recruits liberals.<<hr2Leftist biashr2>>Wikipedia is said to have a liberal bias in which they silence [[minority opinions|minority opinion]] using [[undue weight]] as a shield against [[criticism]]. Wikipedia was said to be founded on [[counterculture]], where [[altruism]] was pushed aside for [[political|political bias]] and [[social bias]].<<note(content=A picture of Peter Singer is provided alongside information such as that he supports [[infanticide]], despite not being relevant to the section.(text=noteCountnote>> The [[Wikimedia Commons]] editing software [[Commonist|Commonist (Wikimedia Commons)]] (a play on {{i[[Communist]]}}) uses the [[hammer and sickle]] as its [[logo]], being embedded into Commonist.<<hr3Researchhr3>>This subsection goes over an article published by [[David Swindle]] on {{i[[FrontPage Magazine]]}} discussing how the political left took over Wikipedia. It references how [[Ann Coulter]], [[Michael Moore]], and other political figures have disproportionate amounts of content on [[criticism]] and [[controversy]].<<hr3Talk Pageshr3>>This following subsection shortly says that Wikipedia's [[talk pages|Talk page (Wikipedia)]] clearly demonstrate a left-winged bias on the site. It gives an example of editors objecting to the authors of an article about the [[Barcelona May Days]] and how the content on the page went against [[Stalinism]].<<hr2Purported "Tertiary" Source and Arbitrary Standardshr2>>Wikipedia is said to be a tertiary source, in which it relies on [[hearsay]], disapproves of using [[logic]] and recent insights on issues and topics, and the immovability of [[orthodoxy]] pre-established on the site. They bring up how a [[Wikipedian]] named [[Yeoberry]] was unable to add information he gathered from [[historical documents|historical document]] and a recent [[academic paper]] on the article regarding [[icons|icon]] and how he was banned after supposedly engaging in actions related to [[edit warring]] and challenging the inconsistency of Wikipedia's standards. Editors are said to weaponize [[conflict of interest]] and [[fringe]] information on [[religious|religious topic]] or [[political topics|political topic]]. Conservapedia states that encyclopedias before Wikipedia were only written by [[experts|expert]], but on Wikipedia [[expertise]] on a [[subject]] is seen as negative.<<hr2Economicshr2>>This section starts by describing how Wikipedia is [[non-profit]] but that Wikia (now [[Fandom|Fandom (website)]]) is [[for-profit]] and that the co-founder of Wikipedia made Wikia favored more by removing [[nofollow]] tags on Wikia [[links|hyperlink]]. Supposedly, despite Wikipedia asking for [[donations|donation]], Wikipedia makes a surplus in profit to keep the site running.<<note(content=Conservapedia also asks for donations, despite making between 5 to 10 million a year. Conservapedia has a profit surplus to keep their site running without a problem, yet have a more obtrusive donate button.(text=noteCountnote>> They also bring up how [[WikiExperts]] can be used to pay for experts to create articles on Wikipedia, which is said to use Wikipedia's [[trademark]] despite not being affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation.<<hr2Scandals and declinehr2>>The section starts with saying that since 2007 there has been a major decline in user accounts on Wikipedia, a steady decline in edits was observed, and that Wikipedia's activity had peaked. It discusses a [[hoax]] of the Wikimedia Foundation propping up normal people as experts, [[persuading|persuasion]] [[college professors|college professor]] to allow Wikipedia to be used as a source, and Wikipedia using the [[slogan]] "OMG! Wikipedia is gone! I’ll flunk my exams!" It is also said that the [[Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee (Wikipedia)]] elections in 2012 on Wikipedia were not getting as many votes because of the [[invasion of privacy]] caused by Wikipedia checking for [[sockpuppet accounts|sockpuppet account]].<<hr2Shane Fitzgerald Hoaxhr2>>The [[Shane Fitzgerald Hoax]] was a hoax on Wikipedia when an Irish student [[Shane Fitzgerald]] after attaching a fictional [[quote]] onto the article for [[Maurice Jarre]], stating:<<quo"One could say my life itself has been one long soundtrack. Music was my life, music brought me to life, and music is how I will be remembered long after I leave this life. When I die there will be a final waltz playing in my head, that only I can hear."quo>>[[Jounalists|Journalist]] took directly from Wikipedia and cited the quote in news articles when Maurice Jarre died, only removing them after Fitzgerald confessed to fabricating the quote for Jarre.<<hr2False claim about Brent Bozellhr2>>[[Brent Bozell]], the founder of the [[Media Research Center]] and the [[Parents Television Council]], described in early 2007 how a [[colleague]] of his, [[Bernie Goldberg]], felt [[upset]] that his article on Wikipedia made it out that Bozell disliked Goldberg. Bozell defended himself by stating a quote made against Goldberg was fabricated.<<note(content=<<AsofMarch 2024>>, Wikipedia's page on Bernie Goldberg does not have the offending quote and instead has one from Bozell praising Goldberg for a book he wrote.(text=noteCountnote>> Bozell then goes over how Conservapedia has dozens of [[allegations|allegation]] against Wikipedia about its liberal bias.<<hr2Rewriting its own historyhr2>>This section goes over how [[Larry Sanger]] and [[Jimmy Wales]] supposedly conflicted with each other on the importance of each other's roles in the [[founding of Wikipedia]]. They cite that Wales edited his own article to personally tone down the influence of Sanger until reverting it in 2005 after being found out by a [[blogger]].<<hr2Seigenthaler scandalhr2>>In late 2005, [[John Seigenthaler Sr.]] contacted Jimmy Wales to discuss how content on his [[biographical|biography]] article was [[false]], in which a [[Wikipedia Administrator]] [[Essjay]] was send out to correct the issue. The content added regarded how Seigenthaler was potentially involved with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] and that he went to the [[Soviet Union]] for over a decade. Wikipedia stated that they would be unable to track down the offending editor, but the [[activist]] [[Daniel Brandt]] identified the editor.<<hr3CNN interviewhr3>>After a 2005 broadcast of [[CNN]] between Seigenthaler and Wales, a CNN moderator [[Kyra Phillips]] told Wales that her article, like Seigenthaler and others, had false content. Wales responded by saying that Wikipedia was always evolving and that Phillips was able to edit her page herself. Brandt (who also objected to content on his page) and Phillips supposedly were unable to edit their pages because of objections from Wikipedia admins. Seigenthaler and [[Brian Lamb]] discussed how pages about prominent [[political figures|political figure]] got [[vandalized|Vandalization on Wikipedia]]. In late 2006, a section on [[Tom DeLay's|Tom DeLay]] article was changed to "Grand Dragon of the [[Republican Party]]." Seigenthaler goes over his own troubles with vandalism, where he was called a [[Nazi]] and that they changed his photo to [[Adolf Hitler]].<<hr3Accountability and Section 230hr3>>Seigenthaler criticized [[Section 230]] of the [[Communications Decency Act of 1996]] where [[internet service providers|internet service provider]] are not able to be [[sued|suing]] for [[deformation]]. Despite what Wales said to Lamb regarding how [[misinformation]] is swiftly removed from articles, Seigenthaler had false content in his article for five [[months|month]]. In the case {{i[[Zeran v. America Online, Inc.]]}}, [[Kenneth Zeran]] sued AOL for hosting defamatory messages against him, which AOL won because of Section 230.<<note(content=AOL was not responsible for creating the content it hosted, and thusly is not the one saying the defamatory messages. The person at fault would be the person who posted the content and not the host. Section 230 was added to allow websites that host content to not fear that content posted by a third party would leave them liable.(text=noteCountnote>> The subsection then states that [[free speech]] in the [[United States]] would not be prosecuted online, even if the content is [[illegal]].<<hr3Essjay given oversighthr3>>During the [[Essjay controversy]], Essjay told a college professor to allow her students to use Wikipedia as a source and complained that Seigenthaler's complaints caused negative publicity. Other admins stated that Seigenthaler could remove the content himself, but doing so would be a conflict of interest. Despite the negative publicity, [[all publicity is good publicity]], giving Wikipedia more visits by curious onlookers to the issue. The subsection describes misinformation present on the Seigenthaler controversy (now [[Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident]]) which has since been removed. Supposedly, admins and editors had many sockpuppets and that keeping editors anonymous was of great importance to the Wikimedia Foundation.<<hr2Brandt / Berlet feudhr2>>In 1991, [[Daniel Brandt]], the founder of [[Namebase]] and [[Wikipedia Watch]], removed [[Chip Berlet]] from his [[Board of Advisors]] because of Berlet's [[disapproval]] of [[L. Fletcher Prouty]], a [[retired|retirement]] [[colonel]] of the [[United States Air Force]]. The [[Daniel Brant controversy]] was started in 2005 when an article about Brandt was created using information from Berlet as a negative source. A Wikipedia admin didn't remove content from Brandt on Berlet because they felt that even if it wasn't [[credible|credibility]], they felt that there had to be something negative on Berlet.<<hr3Biographies of living personshr3>>The [[Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons]] policy was supposedly created because of the Daniel Brant controversy, where Brandt wanted his entry removed. Brandt wanted [[accountability]] of the admins who kept Berlet as a source against Brandt because of Berlet's [[political agenda]]. An entry from [[WikiTruth]] is cited as it describes how Wikipedia despises Brandt because he [[researches|research]]. Admins are still able to edit articles regarding living persons without a method to force Wikipedia to make changes in the case that the articles are [[liable]].<<hr2The Wordbomb Sagahr2>>[[Gary Weiss]] had supposedly edit articles regarding [[Overstock.com]] about his views of the company. Weiss was against Overstock and their [[CEO]] [[Patrick Byrne]] because of their [[naked short selling]]. In 2006, [[Judd Bagley]] had attempted to edit articles in favor of Overstock.com before being stopped by Wikipedia admins. Bagley became Overstock's Director of Communications and tried to expose Weiss that he was editing articles under the name "Mantanmoreland". Weiss then created an article about himself and was found to be using an [[IP|Internet Protocol]] that was also used by the [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]]. The admins sided with Weiss on the matter and used Bagley as a Wikipedia "boogeyman". Editors who agreed with Overstock's complaints were banned as if they were [[proxies|proxy]] of Bagley.<<hr2Michael Moorehr2>>The website [[MichaelMoore.com]] posted a [[photo]] of a Wikipedia editor who edited the page {{i[[SiCKO]]}}<<note(content=Michael Moore was the director of {{iSiCKO}}.(text=noteCountnote>> because of their dissatisfaction with the edits. Wikipedia users did not like how [[Michael Moore's|Michael Moore]] website showed the face of an editor of Wikipedia because they disagreed with the editor's edits. Links to the editor's account were removed from Wikipedia to protect the editor. The editor responded to the post that was urging users to attack the editor by calling users of MichaelMoore.com a [[conservative think tank]].<<hr2Sinbad hoaxhr2>>In 2007, an edit claiming the death of [[Sinbad]] was made on the Wikipedia page, despite being false.<<hr2Robert Clark Young revenge editshr2>>Between 2006 and 2013, the [[author]] [[Robert Clark Young]] under the [[username]] "Qworty" made 13,000 edits. He created sockpuppet accounts, attacked other authors, and bolstered his own article. During the period, Qworty denied the connection for being Young. After [[salon.com]] posted about the connection between Young and Qworty, he was banned from Wikipedia.<<hr2Rutgers-Ivy League hoaxhr2>>There was an article on Wikipedia which stated that [[Rutgers University]] was invited to the [[Ivy League]] and that Rutgers denied it. The {{i[[Daily News]]}} posted an article on this information. The [[hoax]] has since been removed.<<hr2Barbara Bauer vs. Wikimedia Foundationhr2>>The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] was a [[defendant]] in a case brought up by [[Barbara Bauer]] because an article called her the "dumbest" literary agent. This was protected under Section 230 because the Wikimedia Foundation did not write the offending text.<<hr2GFDL License Issuehr2>>This section claims that Wikipedia's deletion of articles, including edit history, violated the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) version 1.2. Conservapedia interprets the license to mean that deletion of articles would directly violate the GFDL. Since mid-2009, articles on Wikipedia is under the GDFL and the [[Creative Commons]] [[CC-BY-SA 3.0]].<<hr2Censorshiphr2>>According to Conservapedia, Wikipedia engages in [[censorship]] (mainly relating to [[politics]], [[COVID-19]], [[global warming]], and [[non-binary]] people). This censorship is in favor of the far-left.<<hr2Cyberbullyinghr2>>This section describes [[cyberbullying on Wikipedia]], such as a [[teenager]] who was [[arrested|arrest]] for making threat against a [[school]] in 2006 and when an editor threatened an Asian student in 2008. [[María Sefidari]], the former Chair of the [[Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees]] is supposedly in a [[romantic relationship]] with [[Laura Hale]], an editor on Wikipedia. Allegedly, Hale and a male editor feuded, and Hale's relationship with Sefidari allowed Hale to suspend the male editor's account for a year. A Wikipedia admin lifted the block on the editor's account, but it was soon reverted and the admin was stripped of is privileges.<<hr2Wikipedia on bestialityhr2>>This section starts by covering how [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Larry Sanger]] are [[atheists|atheist]] before describing that the Wikipedia article on [[zoophilia]] and [[bestiality]] has a section dedicated to arguments for the act.<<note(content=Conservapedia closely ties atheism, belief in evolution, and bestiality together, with multiple articles on the matter. Their repetition of Wales and Sanger being atheist is to have the readers believe that they practice bestiality themselves, which is false.(text=noteCountnote>><<hr2Trademarks and domain nameshr2>>The Wikimedia Foundation uses [[trademarks|trademark]] and [[domain names|domain name]] to try and control the [[brand of Wikipedia]]. This includes Wikia (now [[Fandom|Fandom (website)]]) purchasing domains related to [[WikiLeaks]] for "brand protection", despite [[wiki]] being a type of website.<<hr2Humorous quotes concerning Wikipediahr2>>This section has little importance regarding Wikipedia. There are a total of five [[quotes|quote]], all which paint Wikipedia in a negative light while being [[humorous]] in some manner.<<hr2Unbiased editor recruitmenthr2>>In 2012, the Wikimedia Foundation paid [[Gregory Varnum]] and others to go to the [[Creating Change Conference]], a [[conference]] regarding [[LGBTQ rights]] and [[acceptance|LGBTQ acceptance]]. This was to get editors from more diverse and inclusive backgrounds. There has not been a similar outreach in conservative conferences. [[Sarah Stierch]] was an editor on Wikipedia until she left where she would go onto monitor the [[email]] [[gendergap@lists.wikimedia.org]]. In 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation hired Stierch as a [[Community Fellow|Community Fellow (Wikimedia Foundation)]] for the [[Teahouse Pilot Project]] to introduce new editors to the site. In 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] and [[Wikimedia DC]] encouraged members of [[Congress|United States Congress]] to update articles related to [[pending legislation]] and [[policy issues]].<<hr2Flaws in governance structurehr2>>Conservapedia feels that the largest [[problem in Wikipedia|Problems with Wikipedia]] is how [[Jimmy Wales]] supposedly acts as the leader of Wikipedia and that only him and his friends do significant edits and article creation. [[Aaron Swartz]], a [[programmer]] and [[activist]], said that thousands of users all work on pages on Wikipedia, refuting Wales' statement.<<note(content=It also mentions that Swartz committed [[suicide]], which is not relevant to the section.(text=noteCountnote>> Unlike other [[encyclopedias|encyclopedia]] that have a single [[editor in chief]], Wikipedia has the Arbitration Committee, which Conservapedia considers slow to action and slower to resolution. They partially blame the [[personality]] of Wales on the governance of Wikipedia being poor. Recently, fundraising for the Wikimedia Foundation went from a per-[[country]] basis to a single [[pool|monetary pool]] in which countries need to ask to appropriate funds. Overall, the [[Wikipedia community]] is said to have little to no power over spending or other decisions made by Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation.<<hr2Core policieshr2>>Conservapedia covers how Wikipedia poorly enforces their [[core policies|core policy]] of [[Neutral Point of View|Neutral Point of View (Wikipedia)]], [[Verifiability|Verifiability (Wikipedia)]], and [[No Original Research|No Original Research (Wikipedia)]]. They especially noticed this in regards to topics aligned with [[atheism]].<<hr2Hunter Bidenhr2>>This section goes over how [[Hunter Biden]], the son of [[Joe Biden]], allegedly paid a [[PR firm|public relations firm]] to make his article on Wikipedia look better. Since then, there has been an article created on Wikipedia on the [[Hunter Biden laptop controversy]].`,

    content: `<<shortChange in the title of Gaza warshort>><<img(src=git/wikipedia israel request.png(cap=The result for the first movement for the article.(bigImgimg>>On [[Wikipedia]], there has been a debate since October 7, 2023, regarding the name for the <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_war(text=articlelink>> [[Gaza war]].<<hrTimelinehr>>The following is a timeline of all the movement changes for the article "Gaza war":<<table{{bDate}}|{{bName}}|{{bInformation}}||Oct 7, 2023|2023 Hamas attack on Israel|Original name||Oct 7, 2023|October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel|Moved by Ainty Painty||Oct 7, 2023|October 2023 Gaza−Israel conflict|Moved by Iskandar323||Oct 10, 2023|2023 Israel–Hamas war|Move request passed||Jan 19, 2024|Israel–Hamas war|Move request passed||Jan 27, 2025|Gaza war|Move request passedtable>><<hrOctober 7th 2023 move discussionhr>>{{tFor the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_4#Requested_move_7_October_2023(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 4 § Requested move 7 October 2023link>>}}&spThe [[original]] title for the article was "2023 Hamas attack on Israel", which was accurate for the immediate time when the article was made. It then went to "October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel" and "October 2023 Gaza−Israel conflict" before the first move discussion was made. As the scope of the conflict broadened into a full-out [[war]], a request was made to change the name to fit the new scale.<<hr2Proposed nameshr2>>These are some of the names proposed during the discussion and a short overview of why they were considered or argued against.<<table{{bProposed name}}|{{bReasoning}}||2023 Palestine--Israel war|The scale of the conflict had grown to affect multiple parts of [[Palestine]], even those not directly related to [[Hamas]].||2023 Gaza--Israel war|With a similar case to the previous, highlighting the aspect of the [[Gaza Strip]] compared to the entire [[country]] of Palestine. This was much more popular because the majority of the area affected has been in the Gaza Strip.||2023 Arab--Israel war|This title pushes more involvement onto [[Arabs]] rather than a single [[location]]. This quickly got shot down for being too broad of a group to pin the actions of the war on, while not highlighting the true nature of the conflict.||Hamas invasion of Israel|Following the title "[[Russian invasion of Ukraine]]", this title would show Hamas as an [[invading force]] into Israel. It was quickly rejected for being [[biased|bias]] against Hamas. Hamas also isn't a country and isn't the only opposing force. "[[2022 al-Shabaab invasion of Ethiopia]]" was highlighted as a non-country example, but overall the idea was overturned.||Operation Al-Aqsa Flood|This related to the operation carried out. It did not garner support, but it redirects to [[2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel]].||2023 Israel-Palestine war|A variation ordering the countries [[alphabetically|alphabetical order]].||2023 Gaza war|This title was shorter, but ignored the involvement of [[Israel]] and made it seem that the conflict was primarily inside of the Gaza Strip.||2023 Hamas--Israel war|This heightened the conflict to the status of a war, but kept the core [[belligerents|belligerent]] the same. It became widely popular because it didn't alter who was fighting, just the scale of the operation.table>><<hr2Outcomehr2>>In the end, the name was changed to "2023 Israel--Hamas war". This was said to be because the [[duration]] would be longer than October, the scale has become to one of a war, most credible sources used "Hamas" and not "Gaza", and Gaza itself is not partaking in the majority of the conflict but rather the group behind it. There was no explanation behind the non-alphabetical ordering of Israel and Hamas, most likely because Israel is a country and would take priority.<<hrOctober 11th 2023 move discussionhr>>{{tFor the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_7#Requested_move_11_October_2023(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 7 § Requested move 11 October 2023link>>}}&spThe title of the article during this discussion was "2023 Israel--Hamas war", mainly to change it to "2023 Gaza war" in line with the [[2014 Gaza war]]. This was quickly opposed because despite the inclusion of other military groups, conflict was being split in both Gaza and Israel, and thus to solely focus on Gaza would be misleading. There was no change made to the name of the page.<<hrOctober 15th 2023 move discussionhr>>{{tFor the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_22#Requested_move_15_October_2023(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 22 § Requested move 15 October 2023link>>}}&spThe title of the article during this discussion was still "2023 Israel--Hamas war" to be changed to "2023 Gaza--Israel war." Arguments were made based on the militant activity conducted by Israel inside Gaza, mainly the [[bombarding|Israel bombarding of the Gaza Strip]]. However, it was not a commonly used term, which split the argument.

Despite nearly being closed as having "no consensus", the decision was changed, and "2023 Israel--Hamas war" was moved to "Israel--Hamas war".<<hrJanuary 10th 2024 move discussionhr>>{{tFor the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_35#Requested_move_10_January_2024(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 35 § Requested move 10 January 2024link>>}}&sp<<img(src=git/january 10 israel.png(cap=The discussion for January 10th, 2023.img>>This discussion was made while the article title was still "2023 Israel--Hamas war".

Opposition to the change continued to fall back on the claim that reliable sources still used "Israel--Hamas war" and argued that there were other Gaza Wars. In the end, the name was changed to "Gaza war". This move also led the original article "Gaza War" to be moved to "Gaza War (disambiguation)", with "Gaza War" redirecting to "Gaza war".<<hrFebruary 20th 2025 move discussionhr>>{{tFor the corresponding Wikipedia archive, see <<link(src=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gaza_war/Archive_49#Requested_move_20_February_2025(text=Talk:Gaza war/Archive 49 § Requested move 20 February 2025link>>}}&spThis move discussion regarded changing "Gaza war" to "Gaza war (2023--present)" as there have been multiple Gaza Wars.

Xyz Summoning is a type of [[Special Summon|Special Summoning (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] where the player overlays two or more [[Monsters|Monster (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] with the same [[Level|Level (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] or satisfies some other condition in order to Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster from their [[Extra Deck|Extra Deck (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]].&sp<<hr Xyz Monsters hr>>Xyz Monsters are a type of Monster card that is placed in the Extra Deck. Xyz Monsters have a black card border. Xyz Monsters cannot exist in the [[hand|Hand (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] or [[Main Deck|Main Deck (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. Instead of Levels, Xyz Monsters have [[Ranks|Rank (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. Since Xyz Monsters do not have Levels, any [[effect|Effects (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] that depends on a Monster's Level do not affect Xyz Monsters and can not get involved with any actions that require Monsters with Levels. However, it is possible to give an Xyz Monster levels such as with the [[Pendulum|Pendulum Summoning (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] effect of [[Xiangke Magician|Xiangke Magician (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. Xyz Monsters have what is called Xyz Materials. Xyz Materials are the cards underneath an Xyz Monster in their pile. Typically, an Xyz Material needs to be detached to activate an Xyz Monster's effect. When an Xyz material leaves the [[field|Field (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]], the Xyz Material of that Xyz Monster goes to the Graveyard. [[Tokens|Token Monsters (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] can not be used as Xyz Material.<<hr Mechanics hr>>During [[Main Phase 1|Main Phase (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] or [[Main Phase 2|Main Phase 2 (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]], the [[turn player|Turn Player (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] can Xyz Summon. They can Xyz Summon a monster to any available [[Main|Main Monster Zone (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] or [[Extra Monster|Extra Monster Zone (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] Zone on their side of the field unless otherwise stated. The turn player can also Xyz Summon with no empty Monster Zones should one of the materials used for the Xyz Summon occupy any of those Zones.
<<hr2 1 Material Xyz Summon hr2>>1 Material Xyz Summon refers to the process of summoning an Xyz Monster by using only 1 material. Several cards have an effect that allows the player to perform an Xyz Summon using only 1 material. An example would be [[Number C39: Utopia Ray]] which effect states that the player is allowed to Xyz Summon it by using [[Number 39: Utopia]] as material.<<hr2 Different Material Xyz Summon hr2>>Different Material Xyz Summon refers to the process of summoning an Xyz Monster by using other Monsters or cards that are being treated as valid material for an Xyz Summon requirement when they otherwise aren't. An example of this would be [[Dhampir Vampire Sheridan|Dhampir Vampire Sheridan (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] which allows the player to Xyz Summon it using Monsters owned by the opponent, treating them as Level 6.<<hr2 Card Effect Xyz Summon hr2>>Card Effect Xyz Summon refers to the process of a card effect performing an Xyz Summon after [[resolution|Resolve (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. An example of this would be [[Barian's Chaos Draw|Barian's Chaos Draw (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] which has an effect that allows the player to Special Summon 2 Monster from the [[deck|Main Deck (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] then makes the player Xyz Summon 1 "Number" Monster including both of those previously Special Summoned monsters as material.<<hr2 Special Summon treated as an Xyz Summon hr2>>Some cards allow for the Special Summon of an Xyz Monster but have that Special Summon be treated as an Xyz Summon. For example, if you Special Summon an Xyz Monster from the [[Graveyard|Graveyard (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] using something like [[Monster Reborn|Monster Reborn (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]], that is not treated as an Xyz Summon but rather a Special Summon. An Example of a card that Special Summons an Xyz Monster and treats that Special Summon as an Xyz Summon would be [[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One|Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] which states that the second Special Summon done by its effect is treated as an Xyz Summon.`,

The original [[Japanese]] name for {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}}, {{i遊☆戯☆王}}, is translated to [[English]] as "King of Games". {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} started off as a [[manga]] series. Before the [[card game]], most people knew {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} for the manga where [[Yugi Mutou|Yugi Mutou (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] and other cast members played all sorts of games. Eventually, Kazuki Takahashi made what would later become the card game. It was originally known in-series as {{iMagic & Wizards}}, and later on became known as {{iDuel Monsters}}. The readers of the series loved the card game so much to the point where Kazuki Takahashi made it the main focus of the story and it eventually became the card game of the series.<<hrCard Gamehr>>The real-world card game of {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} is separated into two different versions. These versions are called the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Original Card Game}}, and the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game}}. The {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Original Card Game}} is commonly [[abbreviated|abbreviation]] as "OCG", and similarly the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game}} is abbreviated as "TCG".<<hr2OCGhr2>>The OCG is the version of the game played primarily in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Thailand]]. The OCG has an entirely separate [[banlist|Banlist (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] from the TCG. Cards from the TCG are not legal for use in the OCG due to a difference in the card backs.&sp<<hr2 TCG hr2>>The TCG is the version of the game played primarily worldwide, but mainly in [[America]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], and [[Australia]]. The TCG cards are produced by the [[Belgian|Belgium]] [[company]] of [[Cartamundi]]. The English cards, however, are printed in their production facility in America, whereas all non-English cards they manufacture are done so in their Belgium facility.<<hrAnimehr>><<hr2Toei Animationhr2>>[[Toei Animation]] made an adaptation of the original {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} manga before {{iDuel Monsters}} became the main focus. While Duel Monsters was in the series at the time, it was not the main focus. The Toei Animation is commonly called "Season 0" by some fans, but it should be specified that it is a separate series and not a season of {{iYu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters}}. The Toei anime was never released in English.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}}hr2>>{{tFor {{aiYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}} characters, see [[{{aiYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}} characters]]}}&sp{{iYu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters}} is the "first season" of the {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} anime series. It began its run in Japan on the 18th of April 2000 and ended on the 10th of June 2006. {{iDuel Monsters}} has a total of 224 episodes. It was produced by [[Studio Gallop]] and [[Nihon Ad Systems]]. In America, it was handled by [[4Kids Entertainment]]. {{iDuel Monsters}} was about Yugi Mutou and friends as they played the game of {{iDuel Monsters}} over ancient Egyptian artifacts with supernatural powers, and later in the series, the 3 Egyptian God Cards.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh!

The GX anime started airing on October 6th, 2004, and ended on March 26th, 2008. {{iGX}} started off as a manga spin-off of {{iYu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters}} written by [[Naoyuki Kageyama]]. {{iGX}} follows [[Judai Yuki|Judai Yuki (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] as he goes off into [[high school]] at [[Duel Academy| Duel Academy (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. He gets a "[[Winged Kuriboh|Winged Kuriboh (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]" from an older Yugi Mutou. His high school days are anything but normal. The entire 4th Season, Episode 157 to Episode 180, of {{iYu-Gi-Oh!

Synchro Monsters were the main focus of {{i5D's}}. {{i5D's}} is the story of [[Yusei Futo|Yusei Futo (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] and other characters playing {{iDuel Monsters}} on motorcycles and other vehicles while facing the evils of classism between the poor and the wealthy. Later on in the series Yusei and others must go up against the Dark Signers who are the dead returned to life by the [[Earthbound Gods|Earthbound Immortal (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] as they try to open a portal to the Netherworld in the most dangerous part of where all the roughest part of where all the poor people live. Much later in the series, the main cast must go up against time travelers trying to prevent the mass genocide of humanity by robots after the endless power supply that powers all of [[New Domino City|New Domino City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] gets overloaded causing all of humanity to be doomed and countless lives to be cost in the original timeline's future. In the new timeline, those time travelers intentionally destroyed that generator, which was a less advanced version of the one they had in the future, with an overload 17 years prior to the start of {{i5D's}} causing a lot of lives to be lost, many lives ruined, families to be torn apart, the Earthbound Gods being unsealed and awakened, and a catastrophic tectonic shift that split [[Domino City|Domino City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] in two. {{i5D's}} had a total of 154 episodes, but only 123 of them were ever dubbed into English.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh!

It follows a middle schooler named [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma Tsukumo (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] as he learns how to play {{iDuel Monsters}}, stops 2 other dimensions that were at war with each other from destroying each other, fights what is essentially a god, and prevents a card with the power to rewrite reality itself with absolutely no cost or consequence from getting in the wrong hands. The main focus of {{iZEXAL}} is the collection of the [[Numbers|Numbers (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. The Numbers are the scattered fragments of Astral's memories, who is a being from one of the two warring dimensions; the [[Astral World| Astral World (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. {{iZEXAL}} has a total of 146 episodes.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh!

Eventually, Yuya fuses with all 4 of himself from the different dimensions and is reborn as [[Z-ARC|Z-ARC (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]], and after the dimensional reset of the (formerly) [[Standard Dimension|Standard Dimension (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] into the Pendulum Dimension, he returns to being Yuya with the addition of his other selves living in him. Like previous spin-offs of the {{iYu-Gi-Oh!}} series, {{iARC-V}} introduces a new summoning mechanic. {{iARC-V}} introduces the mechanic of [[Pendulum Summoning|Pendulum Summon (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. While pendulum summoning is the main focus of the series, all other summoning mechanics that were around at this point in time were used frequently in the story as well.<<hr2{{iYu-Gi-Oh!
